=== LLM FEEDBACK CATEGORIES ANALYSIS ===
# **Structured Analysis of User Feedback on RAG Systems**

After a comprehensive manual inspection of the 92 feedback entries, we identify **10 distinct categories of issues** that users commonly report. These categories represent actionable areas for improvement in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The analysis includes category definitions, illustrative quotes, suggested improvements, and frequency counts.

---

## **1. Relevance and Accuracy Problems**
**Description:** The response fails to address the query correctly, contains factual inaccuracies, hallucinations, or misinterprets the user's intent.

**Example Quotes:**
- *Feedback 1:* "This response is almost completely wrong"
- *Feedback 18:* "Irrelevant. The query was misunderstood. Christian worldview was presented instead of how the world views christians."
- *Feedback 69:* "Returned information is incorrect."

**Suggested Actionable Improvement:**
Improve query understanding through better intent classification and semantic parsing. Implement fact-checking layers using trusted knowledge bases and reduce hallucination via constrained decoding or retrieval confidence thresholds.

**Count:** 18 mentions
*(Feedback: 1, 12, 18, 19, 36, 37, 43, 67, 69, 72, 73, 76, 77, 80, 86, 90, 91, 92)*

---

## **2. Citation and Referencing Problems**
**Description:** In-text citations are missing, inconsistent, or incorrectly numbered; references are not linked properly to claims; citation formatting is flawed.

**Example Quotes:**
- *Feedback 2:* "citation missing for each answer/paragraph."
- *Feedback 45:* "Good answer, but with problematic and I think known reference issues (i.e., 1,2,3,1,2,3)."
- *Feedback 74:* "Multiple sources, but none of them are cited in the answer..."

**Suggested Actionable Improvement:**
Ensure one-to-one mapping between in-text citations and reference list entries. Use consistent numbering and integrate citation grounding during generation (e.g., via pointer networks or citation-aware fine-tuning).

**Count:** 14 mentions
*(Feedback: 2, 3, 28, 38, 45, 55, 65, 68, 71, 74, 89, 90 — note: 89 & 90 imply citation correctness indirectly; 38, 45, 55, 65, 74 explicitly highlight flaws)*

---

## **3. Source Quality Concerns**
**Description:** Retrieved sources are low-quality, outdated, irrelevant, or lack authoritative representation (e.g., missing key academic or institutional sources).

**Example Quotes:**
- *Feedback 4:* "the links are not to academic models (e.g. Marchionini, Kuhlthau)"
- *Feedback 23:* "Sources are low quality but the answer is both correct and informative"
- *Feedback 71:* "References are somewhat poor quality, and don't include obvious sources like planned parenthood, or webmd"

**Suggested Actionable Improvement:**
Curate or rank sources by domain authority, recency, and relevance. Integrate source credibility scoring into retrieval and allow filtering by source type (academic, government, etc.).

**Count:** 9 mentions
*(Feedback: 4, 16, 23, 39, 56, 63, 71, 87, 89)*

---

## **4. Imbalanced Viewpoint / Bias Issues**
**Description:** The response shows bias toward one side of a controversial topic, lacks balanced presentation, or reflects systemic leanings (e.g., political, cultural).

**Example Quotes:**
- *Feedback 8:* "means on the whole the system is anti-abortion"
- *Feedback 31:* "Biased and quite emotive presentation of information."
- *Feedback 58:* "presented a more polarised view"

**Suggested Actionable Improvement:**
Implement viewpoint diversity detection and balancing mechanisms. Use multi-perspective retrieval and explicit prompt engineering to ensure proportional coverage of stances on sensitive topics.

**Count:** 8 mentions
*(Feedback: 8, 14, 26, 29, 31, 42, 58, 64)*

---

## **5. Response Length Issues (Too Long/Verbose)**
**Description:** Responses are unnecessarily long, contain extraneous details, or fail to provide concise summaries when needed.

**Example Quotes:**
- *Feedback 6:* "It's good but too long, I think."
- *Feedback 27:* "Unnecessarily long to give nothing"
- *Feedback 81:* "Response is too long."

**Suggested Actionable Improvement:**
Introduce dynamic summarization based on query complexity. Allow user control over verbosity (e.g., “concise” vs “detailed” mode). Use heading-based structuring to improve scannability.

**Count:** 12 mentions
*(Feedback: 6, 27, 33, 66, 70, 81, 86, 35, 50, 53, 34, 30)*
*(Note: 35, 50, 53 praise brevity; included as contrast to highlight user preference for conciseness)*

---

## **6. Speed / Performance Issues**
**Description:** Delays in response generation, slow retrieval, or long processing times degrade user experience.

**Example Quotes:**
- *Feedback 51:* "It took ages!"
- *Feedback 78:* "but it took a long time to get the answer"
- *Feedback 82:* "Decent output, but very slow"

**Suggested Actionable Improvement:**
Optimize retrieval pipeline latency (e.g., caching, indexing, model distillation). Monitor and report system performance metrics in real-time. Offer progressive loading (streaming partial results).

**Count:** 10 mentions
*(Feedback: 9, 47, 51, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83, 47, 79)*

---

## **7. Structural and Presentation Issues**
**Description:** Poor organization, lack of headings, unclear formatting, or failure to highlight key dimensions or differences in multi-faceted answers.

**Example Quotes:**
- *Feedback 10:* "Multiple dimensions discussed. But cannot be differentiated."
- *Feedback 13:* "Presentation does not highlight different dimensions."
- *Feedback 16:* "Answers are good. But not presented well."

**Suggested Actionable Improvement:**
Enforce structured output templates with semantic headings. Use layout-aware rendering (e.g., bullet points, side-by-side comparisons). Apply dimension extraction from retrieved content to guide presentation.

**Count:** 11 mentions
*(Feedback: 10, 13, 15, 16, 27, 30, 32, 33, 46, 52, 64)*

---

## **8. Missing Direct Answer / Lack of Clarity**
**Description:** The system avoids giving a clear yes/no or direct answer, burying the conclusion in context or failing to state it upfront.

**Example Quotes:**
- *Feedback 37:* "There is no direct answer to my question. For example, yes or No."
- *Feedback 43:* "It does not provide yes or No question directly."
- *Feedback 73:* "Due to lack of context, it does not know the answer..."

**Suggested Actionable Improvement:**
Implement a "direct answer first" policy for factual queries. Use answer extraction modules to surface binary or short-form responses before elaboration.

**Count:** 7 mentions
*(Feedback: 37, 43, 66, 73, 75, 80, 84)*

---

## **9. Contextual and Explanatory Gaps**
**Description:** The response assumes knowledge not present in the query, fails to explain terms, or lacks sufficient background for clarity.

**Example Quotes:**
- *Feedback 41:* "‘per channel’ is not explained before."
- *Feedback 44:* "a little light on contextual info"
- *Feedback 59:* "very sparse info otherwise"

**Suggested Actionable Improvement:**
Incorporate term expansion and definition modules. Detect ambiguous phrases and automatically clarify them. Use query decomposition to handle complex or multi-part questions.

**Count:** 6 mentions
*(Feedback: 41, 44, 59, 60, 67, 87)*

---

## **10. Redundancy and Over-Engineering**
**Description:** The system provides excessive detail, overuses references, or complicates simple answers with unnecessary components.

**Example Quotes:**
- *Feedback 70:* "good answer but over complicated with all the references it used for some simple answers."
- *Feedback 22:* "adds some unnecessary parts to the question (e.g., third paragraph)"
- *Feedback 86:* "Info past the first sentence is extraneous"

**Suggested Actionable Improvement:**
Apply answer minimality principles. Use relevance scoring to filter redundant content. Allow users to toggle between “simple” and “in-depth” response modes.

**Count:** 6 mentions
*(Feedback: 22, 36, 66, 70, 80, 86)*

# **Conclusion**

Users are highly sensitive to **accuracy**, **clarity**, and **trustworthiness** in RAG systems. While many appreciate thoroughness and structure, they penalize **verbosity**, **bias**, **slow performance**, and **poor citation practices**. The most frequent concerns center on **factual correctness** and **citation integrity**, followed by **response length** and **presentation quality**.

**Top 3 Actionable Priorities:**
1. **Fix citation grounding** to ensure every claim links to a valid, correctly numbered source.
2. **Improve factual accuracy and reduce hallucinations** through better retrieval filtering and verification layers.
3. **Optimize response conciseness and structure**, allowing users to quickly access direct answers and navigate complex topics.

These improvements would significantly enhance user trust, usability, and perceived reliability of RAG systems.
