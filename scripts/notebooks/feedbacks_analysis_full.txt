=== LLM FEEDBACK CATEGORIES ANALYSIS ===
# **Structured Analysis of User Feedback on RAG Systems**

After a comprehensive manual inspection of the 100 user feedback entries, we identify **10 distinct categories of issues** that users commonly report. These categories represent actionable areas for improvement in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While some align with known categories (e.g., citation problems, bias), others emerge as new or underappreciated concerns (e.g., answer format clarity, retrieval routing).

Each category includes:
- A **name**
- A **brief description**
- **2–3 example quotes** from the feedback
- A **suggested actionable improvement**
- The **count** of feedbacks mentioning the issue

---

## **1. Relevance and Accuracy Problems**
**Description**: The response fails to address the query correctly, contains factual errors, hallucinations, or misinterprets the user's intent.

**Examples**:
- *Feedback 1*: "This response is almost completely wrong"
- *Feedback 18*: "Irrelevant. The query was misunderstood. Christian worldview was presented instead of how the world views christians."
- *Feedback 69*: "Returned information is incorrect."

**Suggested Improvement**:
Implement stronger query understanding via intent classification and semantic alignment between query and retrieved documents. Use fact-checking modules or confidence scoring to flag potentially inaccurate generations.

**Count**: **18**

---

## **2. Citation and Referencing Problems**
**Description**: In-text citations are missing, mismatched, improperly formatted, or references are listed without clear linkage to claims in the text.

**Examples**:
- *Feedback 2*: "citation missing for each answer/paragraph."
- *Feedback 45*: "Good answer, but with problematic and I think known reference issues (i.e., 1,2,3,1,2,3)."
- *Feedback 74*: "Multiple sources, but none of them are cited in the answer..."

**Suggested Improvement**:
Enforce consistent in-text citation formatting (e.g., numbered brackets linked to reference list). Develop a citation grounding mechanism that ensures every cited source is explicitly tied to a specific claim.

**Count**: **15**

---

## **3. Imbalanced Viewpoint / Bias Issues**
**Description**: The response shows a skewed perspective, favors one side of a debate, or reflects systemic bias (e.g., political, cultural, brand).

**Examples**:
- *Feedback 8*: "the system is anti-abortion"
- *Feedback 31*: "Biased and quite emotive presentation of information."
- *Feedback 100*: "Biased in favor of Toyota"

**Suggested Improvement**:
Introduce viewpoint diversity detection in retrieval and generation. Use bias mitigation techniques such as counterfactual augmentation, adversarial debiasing, or multi-perspective summarization pipelines.

**Count**: **10**

---

## **4. Response Length and Verbosity Issues**
**Description**: Responses are too long, contain unnecessary details, or fail to provide concise summaries when needed.

**Examples**:
- *Feedback 6*: "It's good but too long, I think."
- *Feedback 27*: "Unnecessarily long to give nothing"
- *Feedback 81*: "Response is too long."

**Suggested Improvement**:
Enable dynamic response length control (e.g., “concise” vs “detailed” modes). Use summarization layers or extractive pre-processing to identify core answers before generation.

**Count**: **12**

---

## **5. Source Quality and Relevance Concerns**
**Description**: Retrieved sources are low-quality, outdated, irrelevant, or lack authoritative credibility (e.g., missing key academic or institutional sources).

**Examples**:
- *Feedback 4*: "the links are not to academic models (e.g. Marchionini, Kuhlthau)"
- *Feedback 23*: "Sources are low quality but the answer is both correct and informative"
- *Feedback 71*: "References are somewhat poor quality, and don't include obvious sources like planned parenthood, or webmd"

**Suggested Improvement**:
Improve source ranking using domain authority signals (e.g., journal impact factor, institutional trustworthiness). Integrate source quality filters or allow users to set source preferences (e.g., peer-reviewed only).

**Count**: **11**

---

## **6. Speed and Performance Issues**
**Description**: Delays in response generation, retrieval, or interactivity; perceived slowness during model switching or query execution.

**Examples**:
- *Feedback 51*: "It took ages!"
- *Feedback 78*: "but it took a long time to get the answer"
- *Feedback 82*: "Decent output, but very slow"

**Suggested Improvement**:
Optimize retrieval pipeline latency (e.g., caching, indexing, model distillation). Monitor and benchmark end-to-end response time across query types and implement performance alerts.

**Count**: **10**

---

## **7. Missing or Incomplete Answers**
**Description**: The system fails to provide a direct answer (e.g., yes/no), omits key facts, or does not fully address all parts of a multi-faceted query.

**Examples**:
- *Feedback 37*: "There is no direct answer to my question. For example, yes or No."
- *Feedback 91*: "did not enumerate all wars"
- *Feedback 36*: "it does not print the first two Fibonacci numbers"

**Suggested Improvement**:
Implement answer completeness checks using query decomposition and checklist-based verification. Ensure binary or list-type queries receive explicit, structured responses.

**Count**: **9**

---

## **8. Retrieval and Routing Problems**
**Description**: The system retrieves irrelevant documents, fails to find relevant data, or uses suboptimal routing strategies (e.g., wrong model or data source selected).

**Examples**:
- *Feedback 68*: "retrieval looks sub-optimal"
- *Feedback 96*: "it didn't find documents that actually talks about RAG."
- *Feedback 47*: "When I switch from one model to another it takes more time to process."

**Suggested Improvement**:
Enhance query routing logic with better intent detection and domain classification. Use feedback loops to retrain retrieval models based on user corrections.

**Count**: **7**

---

## **9. Presentation and Formatting Issues**
**Description**: Poor visual structure, confusing formatting (e.g., math errors), lack of headings, or unclear organization hinders readability.

**Examples**:
- *Feedback 93*: "Format error can lead to confusion $$ \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$"
- *Feedback 16*: "Answers are good. But not presented well."
- *Feedback 30*: praises headings — implies their absence is a problem elsewhere

**Suggested Improvement**:
Standardize output formatting with semantic structure (headings, bullet points, code blocks). Validate mathematical or technical notation rendering. Allow user-customizable presentation styles.

**Count**: **6**

---

## **10. Timeliness and Recency of Information**
**Description**: The system lacks up-to-date content, fails to include recent events, or uses outdated examples.

**Examples**:
- *Feedback 75*: "The system does not have data for recent 2025 event..."
- *Feedback 39*: "some seem a bit outdated (Emma Watson)"
- *Feedback 87*: "lacks recent content, or names of songs"

**Suggested Improvement**:
Integrate real-time or frequently updated knowledge bases. Flag potentially outdated information and indicate the temporal scope of the knowledge source.

**Count**: **5**

---

# **Conclusion**

The feedback reveals that while RAG systems are often perceived as informative and comprehensive, they suffer from **systemic weaknesses** in **accuracy, citation integrity, bias mitigation, and usability**. The most frequently cited issues are **relevance/accuracy**, **citation problems**, and **verbosity**, suggesting that users prioritize **correctness, transparency, and conciseness**.

### **Top 3 Actionable Priorities**:
1. **Improve citation grounding and consistency** to build trust.
2. **Enhance retrieval accuracy and source quality filtering** to reduce hallucinations and irrelevance.
3. **Introduce adaptive response length and structure** to balance depth with clarity.

Additionally, addressing **bias, performance, and timeliness** will be critical for deployment in high-stakes or real-time applications. Continuous user feedback integration should be central to RAG system evolution.
