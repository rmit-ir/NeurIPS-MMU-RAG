{"query_id": "3", "query": "Cider vinegar is good for acid reflux? Isn't it acidic?", "generated_response": "It might seem counter-productive to add more acid to your already struggling system, but apple cider vinegar can make you feel so much better. Sometimes acid reflux can be caused by a lack of acid or lower amounts of acid in your system. Adding a bit of acidic apple cider vinegar can stop these problems before they occur. Combine 3 tsps or 1 tablespoon of raw, unfiltered, apple cider vinegar with 6-8 ounces of fresh water and drink before a meal. You can repeat before each meal or even 3-4 times throughout the day. Notes: If you notice that your acid reflux is worsening, discontinue this home remedy.", "citations": ["clueweb22-en0022-52-08268:12"]}
{"query_id": "6", "query": "How are proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers compared?", "generated_response": "H2 blockers are less expensive and seem to be safer than the PPI medications. In a 2016 study led by Dr. Morgan Grams of Johns Hopkins University, people who use PPIs are more likely to develop chronic kidney disease compared to those who take other types of heartburn medication.", "citations": ["clueweb22-en0025-37-14848:1", "clueweb22-en0025-37-14848:5"]}
{"query_id": "12", "query": "Is garlic considered to be a type of spice?", "generated_response": "Yes, garlic can boost metabolism. The sulphur compounds in garlic support your digestive system, which is important for overall health and weight management. Regular garlic consumption can increase your metabolism, helping your body burn more calories for energy. Garlic is nutrient-dense (rich in vitamins B6, C, manganese, selenium, etc.) and very low in calories, so it's easy to include in your meals without adding excess energy. Although garlic is associated with many health benefits, a few studies suggest it may increase the likelihood of heartburn in people with acid reflux - especially raw garlic. So be extra cautious when adding it to your diet.", "citations": ["clueweb22-en0005-21-03017:3", "clueweb22-en0005-21-03017:19", "clueweb22-en0041-89-12545:2"]}

{"query_id": "41", "query": "How can I figure out my lactate threshold?", "generated_response": "While exercising above the threshold, more lactate is produced than can be removed from the muscle. A reliable test method for the threshold is the talk test. If you are exercising and can explain easily to someone what you (for example) did on the weekend, you are below the threshold. If you have difficulty explaining, you are at the threshold. And if you can't, then you are above the threshold.", "citations": ["clueweb22-en0014-15-18261:6"]}
