{"query_id": "4", "query": "Why does acid reflux happen? Does acid reflux have a reason?", "generated_response": "Acid reflux is a condition that occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)--a muscle between the stomach and esophagus-- malfunctions, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. This can cause a burning sensation in your heart and chest, which we often refer to as \"heartburn.\" Over time, prolonged acid reflux can cause damage to the esophagus and potentially lead to the chronic form of the condition called GERD. Acid reflux happens due to improper functioning of the LES. Acid reflux normally happens when we eat certain foods that stimulate excess acid production; however, for some people, genetics plays a role in reflux. Eating large meals, lying down straight after eating, or snacking close to bedtime are also common triggers of reflux. Being overweight means that you are more likely to suffer from reflux because of increased pressure on your stomach, which can force open the valve after a meal. Some people find that acid reflux is worse when they are stressed. Acid reflux also happens due to a weakness of the sphincter muscle, or when the stomach produces too much acid and not enough protective mucus. There is also something called a hiatus hernia; due to a gap in the diaphragm, parts of the stomach can move into the chest, which increases the risk of reflux.", "citations": ["clueweb22-en0032-81-17497:1", "clueweb22-en0021-49-01914:1", "clueweb22-en0038-68-03750:1"]}

{"query_id": "16", "query": "No, I am asking you to tell me about different types of coffee beans generally, not just non-sour one.", "generated_response": "There are four different types of coffee beans in the world. 1) Arabica makes up most coffee grown at present, accounting for about 60% of commercial coffee production. It originated in Ethiopia, where it grows wild. However, people first cultivated it in Yemen, and it is from there that it takes its name. Arabica beans have sweeter and more complex flavors than Robusta coffee beans, which is why they currently dominate coffee markets, especially specialty coffee markets. Arabica coffee beans have a bright acidity, medium body, and multiple layers of flavor. They are well suited to be brewed pour-over style, which lets their subtleties shine more than espresso or immersion brewing. 2) Robusta is the second most commonly grown type of coffee bean. Robusta's name comes from being more robust than the Arabica plants, which is why you can grow it in a broader range of environments. Therefore, it is less prone to disease. However, despite these advantages, it remains less popular than Arabica because its flavors and aromas aren't as desirable. Robusta beans are known for having a darker, earthier flavor, and for this reason, they are most often subjected to a darker roast to better match their natural character. Robusta beans also have nearly twice the caffeine of Arabica beans. While Robusta beans are generally considered lower quality than Arabica, this is not necessarily the case. There are a growing number of farmers and processors working to develop high-quality Robusta beans and Robusta-Arabica hybrids. 3) Liberica beans make up only about 2% of the world's current coffee crop. Once upon a time, this varietal was far more critical after disease wiped out much of the world's Arabica supply. Arabica has since made a comeback, and Liberica production has primarily ceased. However, that may change in the future, as climate change makes it increasingly challenging to produce the more sensitive Arabica plants reliably. Liberica coffee has a unique flavor, pairing floral and fruity notes with a deep smokiness that some describe as woody. It has a full-bodied, reminiscent of Robusta coffee. It's not to everyone's taste, but there are some exceptional Liberica coffees to be had when done right. 4) Excelsa has recently been reclassified as a type of Liberica coffee because it thrives in the same conditions and grows a similarly tall tree. But the actual coffee it produces is vastly different. It has a much fruitier character than Liberica, with a tart acidity that makes it popular for adding complexity to coffee blends. Excelsa coffee makes up only about 7% of the current coffee market. Still, given its appealing flavor profile and the fact that it is nearly as resilient and productive as Robusta, this seems likely to grow. Much like Robusta, Excelsa coffee has been regarded as poor quality, but this is more due to poor growing and processing practices than the bean itself. With the proper care, Excelsa has the potential to be specialty-grade coffee.", "citations": ["clueweb22-en0035-25-05669:1", "clueweb22-en0035-25-05669:4", "clueweb22-en0035-25-05669:6", "clueweb22-en0035-25-05669:8"]}

Place the central bridge of the tape over the palmar side (the inner surface) of the middle joint of the injured finger. Start by wrapping the two tails around the section of the finger closer to the palm (proximal phalanx), anchoring it firmly. Then, slightly bend the finger, about 30 degrees at the joint, and wrap the other two tails around the section of the finger beyond the joint (middle phalanx).

There should be a balance, and you should not rely excessively on taping. If you want to reduce the risk of A2 pulley injuries, you can take several training precautions. First, strengthen your fingers progressively using open-hand positions on hang boards, and avoid crimping under load during training, especially when fatigued.

The obvious difference is that a 10 km training plan is longer in duration, and includes longer distance runs each week. The plan may also include other activities like speed workouts, strength training and cross-training depending on your running goals. For a 5 km race, an appropriate interval workout would be: 5 x 3 minutes at 5k race pace with 3 minutes of jogging between runs. For a 10k race, an appropriate interval workout would be: 4 x 5 minutes at 10k race pace with 3 minutes of jogging between runs. Running a 5 km race means you'll run half the 10 km distance at a pace which is about 16 seconds per mile faster than your current 10 km speed. Thus, running a 5 km is a great way to develop the ability to run continuously at a velocity which is significantly faster than your current 10 km pace; each 5 km is in effect a 'stepping stone' to a faster 10 km. As your efficiency at 5 km speed improves, you'll be able to run longer distances at the current 5 km tempo; eventually, you should be able to run your 10 kms at your current 5 km speed (of course, when that happens your 5 kms will be considerably faster).

Your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding counsellor might be able to help identify any other underlying issues. Some women find rubbing breast milk onto their nipples can be soothing. Products like Vaseline or lanolin can help with dry or cracked nipples (although there's little evidence to show what really works well). After each feed, let your nipples dry before getting dressed - change your breast pads after every feed. Avoid using soap, as this can dry out your skin. If possible, only wear cotton, non-underwired bras. It's best to avoid using nipple shields and breast shells - these will not improve your baby's attachment to the breast. Try not to shorten feeds - doing so will not ease the pain and may reduce your milk supply.

Recovery time varies depending on the peel's depth: light peels typically require about a week, while medium to deep peels may need over a month for full healing. During recovery, it's essential to avoid abrasive skincare products or techniques to allow the skin to heal properly, and extra care must be taken as chemical peels increase sensitivity to sunlight. Another effective option is microdermabrasion, ideal for individuals looking to reduce signs of photoaging, uneven skin tone and texture, such as hyperpigmentation and melasma, fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores, atrophic or indented scars (including acne scars), and stretch marks. Safe for all skin types and tones--including darker skin--microdermabrasion works by mechanically buffing the epidermis using a handheld device that sprays exfoliating microcrystals to gently sand away dead skin cells, stimulating new, healthy skin growth.

While both procedures can be performed in-office by a clinician or at home, they work through different mechanisms: microdermabrasion physically exfoliates by scraping away the topmost layer of skin cells, whereas chemical peels use acid solutions to chemically peel away layers of skin. Chemical peels tend to be more effective for treating acne-prone and sensitive skin, but microdermabrasion is considered safer for darker skin tones. Neither treatment is suitable for all skin types, so careful consideration is needed before choosing one. Both microdermabrasion and light chemical peels can reduce the appearance of large pores--not by shrinking them, which isn't possible, but by clearing excess oil and debris that cause pore dilation, making them appear smaller. Additionally, both treatments help fade dark spots by removing the damaged, pigmented cells in the top layers of skin, allowing healthier new cells to surface.

Mesotherapy and microneedling are both popular skin treatments, but they work in different ways and serve slightly different purposes. Microneedling uses tiny needles to create micro-injuries in the skin, which stimulates collagen production and improves texture, scars, and fine lines. Mesotherapy, on the other hand, involves injecting a blend of vitamins, hyaluronic acid, and other nutrients directly into the skin to boost hydration, radiance, and superficial rejuvenation. If your goal is deeper skin renewal and firming, microneedling may be more effective. For added glow and hydration, mesotherapy is a great choice. Some people combine both treatments for more comprehensive results.", "citations": ["clueweb22-en0027-37-11888:15"]}
{"query_id": "70", "query": "Hi, how can I find a good shampoo for my hair?", "generated_response": "When choosing a shampoo for an oily scalp, opt for products labelled \"volumizing,\" \"strengthening,\" or \"balancing,\" as these are typically formulated to manage excess oil without adding unnecessary weight. Avoid shampoos that advertise moisturizing, hydrating, or smoothing effects, as well as those designed for curly or frizzy hair--these formulas tend to be too rich and can make oily hair feel heavy or greasy. Look for labels that specifically mention \"for oily hair\" or highlight oil-controlling and balancing benefits. It's also wise to consider anti-dandruff shampoos, since dandruff is not always a result of dryness; it's often triggered by microscopic fungi that thrive on excess scalp oil, leading to irritation and flaking. For a deeper cleanse, you can occasionally use a clarifying shampoo to remove buildup but limit its use to avoid over-drying or irritating the scalp.", "citations": ["clueweb22-en0037-41-10440:5", "clueweb22-en0022-93-06707:10"]}
