But when the basketball hits the ground, it bounces back up and transfers energy to the ping-pong ball.\n\nAs a result, the ping-pong ball shoots upward much higher than you dropped it from. This is due to conservation of momentum and energy. When the basketball hits the ground, it compresses and rebounds. If the ping-pong ball is still just above it, the upward-moving basketball collides with it. As the basketball is much more massive, most of the collision energy gets transferred to the lighter ping-pong ball and thus launches it sharply upward.","iid":"V_0934"}

{"query":"how can i measure the lift force of paper plane","reference":"To measure the lift force generated by a paper airplane, there are two main approaches: a simple hands-on experiment or a more technical calculation using the aerodynamic lift equation.\n\nIn the first method, you can use a sensitive kitchen or lab scale along with a hairdryer to simulate airflow. Start by placing the paper airplane on a lightweight, stable support positioned on the scale. First, measure and record the weight of the airplane without any airflow. Then, turn on the hairdryer and direct the air at the wings of the plane, mimicking flight conditions. With the air blowing over the wings, the scale will show a reduced weight reading. The difference between the two measurements\u2014before and during airflow\u2014provides an estimate of the lift force. This method is straightforward and useful for visualizing the basic concept of lift, although it may be imprecise due to variability in airflow or movement of the plane.\n\nThe second approach involves calculating lift using the standard lift equation from aerodynamics:\nL = Cl \u00d7 \u00bd \u00d7 \u03c1 \u00d7 V\u00b2 \u00d7 A,\nwhere L is the lift force, Cl is the lift coefficient (a value based on the wing shape and angle of attack), \u03c1 is the air density, V is the airspeed, and A is the wing area. To use this method, you\u2019ll need to measure or estimate each of these values. The wing area can be found by measuring the length and width of the plane\u2019s wings. Airspeed can be determined with a handheld anemometer or estimated based on the hairdryer\u2019s settings. Air density is usually taken as 1.225 kg\/m\u00b3 at sea level. The lift coefficient may require research or approximation based on similar wing types. Once these values are known, you can plug them into the formula to compute the lift force.
