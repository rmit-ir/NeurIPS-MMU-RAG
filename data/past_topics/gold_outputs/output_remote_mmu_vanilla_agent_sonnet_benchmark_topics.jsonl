{"query_id": "200", "generated_response": "# Understanding the Holocaust: A Comprehensive Analysis\n\nThe Holocaust represents one of history's most systematic and devastating genocides. Based on extensive historical research, I'll provide you with a thorough understanding of this tragedy.\n\n## What Was the Holocaust\n\nThe Holocaust was a systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of approximately six million Jews and millions of others by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1933-1945. It has been characterized as \"a project of industrial extermination\" that brought together medieval religious persecution with modern industrial methods [1].\n\n## Origins and Causes\n\n### Historical Antisemitism\nThe Holocaust had deep roots in European antisemitism. Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews were subjected to persecution based on Christian theology, blamed for rejecting and killing Jesus [1]. This included:\n- Attacks during the Crusades (1095-1149)\n- Expulsions from England, Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal between the 1290s-1497\n- Martin Luther's 1543 call for harsh persecution in \"On the Jews and Their Lies\" [1]\n\n### Modern Racial Theory\nThe 19th century saw the emergence of pseudo-scientific racism, including the Völkisch movement in Germany and Austria-Hungary, which viewed Jews as a race in \"mortal combat with the Aryan race for world domination\" [1].\n\n### Nazi Ideology\nHitler's obsession with antisemitism became central to Nazi policy. Most historians agree that \"his overriding obsession was hatred of the Jews, and he showed on a number of occasions that he was willing to risk losing the war to achieve their destruction\" [1].\n\n## How It Transpired\n\n### Escalating Persecution\nThe process evolved in stages:\n1. **1933-1939**: Legal discrimination and social exclusion\n2. **1939**: Hitler authorized the T-4 Euthanasia Program, killing 65,000-70,000 disabled individuals - considered the \"first phase\" that precipitated the Holocaust [1]\n3. **1940-1941**: Ghettoization and planning for mass murder\n4. **1941-1945**: Industrial-scale extermination\n\n### The \"Final Solution\"\nEvidence suggests that by fall 1941, Hitler and Himmler agreed on complete mass extermination of European Jewry. The Wannsee Conference of January 20, 1942, coordinated implementation across Nazi-occupied Europe [1].\n\n## Responsibility and Collaboration\n\n### Primary Responsibility\nWhile Hitler and Nazi leadership bear ultimate responsibility, the Holocaust involved massive collaboration:\n\n- **Nazi Leadership**: Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich, Eichmann, and other key figures [1]\n- **German Military**: The Wehrmacht participated in massacres and provided logistical support [1]\n- **German Civilians**: Studies suggest 27-29% of Germans had information about the Holocaust, with another 10-13% suspecting atrocities [1]\n- **European Collaborators**: The Holocaust became a \"pan-European program\" involving willing collaborators across occupied Europe [1]\n\n### Scale of Participation\nAs historian Konnilyn G. Feig noted: \"The task was so enormous, complex, time-consuming, and mentally and economically demanding that it took the best efforts of millions of Germans... All spheres of life in Germany actively participated\" [1].\n\n## Impact on European Jewry\n\n### Demographic Devastation\n- **Poland**: 90% of Polish Jews (approximately 3 million) were murdered [1]\n- **Lithuania**: 90% death rate, the highest in Europe [1]\n- **Hungary**: Over 564,000 Hungarian Jews killed [1]\n- **Netherlands**: Nearly 80% of 140,000 Dutch Jews were murdered [1]\n\n### Cultural Destruction\nThe Holocaust decimated centuries-old Jewish communities, destroying:\n- Religious and cultural institutions\n- Yiddish-speaking communities\n- Sephardic communities in Greece\n- Ancient Jewish communities across Eastern Europe\n\n## Allied Knowledge and Response\n\nThe Allies had substantial evidence of ongoing atrocities:\n- Churchill knew of mass executions by August 1941 [1]\n- The Polish government-in-exile published detailed reports in 1942 [1]\n- The Riegner Telegram described Nazi plans in August 1942 [1]\n\nHowever, response was limited. The US failed to lift immigration restrictions and refused to bomb death camps despite having the capability [1].\n\n## Conclusion and Liberation\n\nThe Holocaust ended with Nazi Germany's defeat in May 1945. Allied forces liberated the concentration camps, revealing the full scope of the atrocities to the world.\n\n## Lasting Effects\n\n### Legal and Moral Framework\n- Development of \"crimes against humanity\" in international law\n- Nuremberg Trials establishing precedent for prosecuting genocide\n- Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)\n\n### State of Israel\nThe Holocaust became central to the argument for Jewish statehood, leading to Israel's establishment in 1948.\n\n### Memory and Education\nThe Holocaust fundamentally changed how we understand:\n- The capacity for systematic evil in modern society\n- The importance of protecting human rights\n- The dangers of unchecked authoritarianism and racial hatred\n\n## Comparison to Sodom and Gomorrah\n\nYour reference to Sodom and Gomorrah is thought-provoking. While these biblical cities faced divine destruction for moral corruption, the Holocaust represents something different - systematic human evil enabled by modern state apparatus and widespread complicity.\n\nUnlike divine judgment in religious narratives, the Holocaust was perpetrated by humans against other humans, making it a profound indictment of human capacity for evil when moral restraints collapse. Some historians argue this makes it more disturbing than natural disasters or divine punishment, as it reveals the potential for ordinary people to participate in or enable systematic murder.\n\nThe Holocaust stands as a unique warning about the fragility of civilization and the constant need to protect human dignity and rights against the forces of hatred and authoritarianism.", "citations": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_for_the_Holocaust"], "contexts": ["Responsibility for the Holocaust - Wikipedia Responsibility for the Holocaust From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Part of a series on The Holocaust Jews on selection ramp at Auschwitz, May 1944 Responsibility Early policies Victims Ghettos Camps Atrocities Resistance International response Aftermath Lists Resources Remembrance v t e Responsibility for the Holocaust is the subject of an ongoing historical debate that has spanned several decades. The debate about the origins of the Holocaust is known as functionalism versus intentionalism. Intentionalists such as Lucy Dawidowicz argue that Adolf Hitler planned the extermination of the Jewish people as early as 1918, and personally oversaw its execution. However, functionalists such as Raul Hilberg argue that the extermination plans evolved in stages, as a result of initiatives that were taken by bureaucrats in response to other policy failures. To a large degree, the debate has been settled by acknowledgement of both centralized planning and decentralized attitudes and choices. The primary responsibility for the Holocaust rests on Hitler and the Nazi Party leadership, but operations to persecute Jews, Romani people, homosexuals and others were also perpetrated by the Schutzstaffel (SS), the Wehrmacht, and ordinary German citizens as well as by collaborationist members of various European governments, including their soldiers and civilians. A host of factors contributed to the environment in which atrocities were committed across the continent, ranging from general racism (including antisemitism ), religious hatred, blind obedience, apathy, political opportunism, coercion, profiteering, and xenophobia .

The Holocaust has been characterized as a project of industrial extermination. [1] This led authors such as Enzo Traverso to argue in The Origins of Nazi Violence that Auschwitz was explicitly a product of Western civilization originating from medieval religious and racial persecution that brought together a \"particular kind of stigmatization ...rethought in the light of colonial wars and genocides .\" [2] [a] Beginning his book with a description of the guillotine, which according to him marks the entry of the Industrial Revolution into capital punishment, he writes: \"Through an irony of history, the theories of Frederick Taylor\" (taylorism) were applied by a totalitarian system to serve \"not production, but extermination.\" [3] [b] Others like Russell Jacoby contend that the Holocaust is a product of German history with deep roots in German society ranging from, \"German authoritarianism, feeble liberalism, brash nationalism or virulent antisemitism. From A. J. P. Taylor 's The Course of German History fifty-five years ago to Daniel Goldhagen 's controversial work, Hitler's Willing Executioners, Nazism is understood as the outcome of a long history of uniquely German traits\". [4] While some claim that the specificity of the Holocaust was also rooted in the constant antisemitism from which Jews had been the target since the foundation of Christianity, intellectual historian George Mosse argued that the extreme form of European racism that led to the Holocaust fully emerged in the eighteenth century. [5] Others argue that pseudo-scientific racist theories were elaborated upon in order to justify white supremacy and that they were accompanied by the Darwinian belief in the survival of the fittest and eugenic notions of racial hygiene —particularly within the German scientific community. [6] [c] [d] Authorization[edit] The question of overall responsibility for the atrocities committed under the Nazi regime traverses the oligarchy of those in command, foremost among them Adolf Hitler. In October 1939, he authorized the first Nazi mass killing for those labeled \"undesirables\" in the T-4 Euthanasia Program.[7] [8] The Nazis termed such people as being \"Lives unworthy of life.\" or lebensunwertes Leben in German. [9] Before the euthanasia program in Germany-proper was over, the Nazis killed between 65,000–70,000 persons. [10] Historian Henry Friedlander calls this period during which the 70,000 adults were killed, the \"first phase\" of the T4 Program since the program and its contributors precipitated the Holocaust. [11] Sometime between late June 1940 when planning for Operation Barbarossa first started and March 1941, orders were approved by Hitler for the re-establishment of the Einsatzgruppen (the surviving historical record does not permit firm conclusions to be drawn about the precise date). [12] Hitler encouraged the killings of the Jews of Eastern Europe by the Einsatzgruppen death squads in a speech of July 1941. [13] Evidence suggests that in the fall of 1941, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler and Hitler agreed in principle on the complete mass extermination of the Jews of Europe by gassing, with Hitler explicitly ordering the \"annihilation of the Jews\" in a speech on 12 December 1941, by which time the Jewish populations in the Baltic states had been effectively eliminated. [14] To make for smoother intra-governmental cooperation in the implementation of this so-called \"Final Solution to the Jewish Question \", the Wannsee conference was held near Berlin on 20 January 1942, with the participation of fifteen senior officials, led by Reinhard Heydrich and Adolf Eichmann; the records of which provide the best evidence of the central planning of the Holocaust. Just five weeks later on 22 February, Hitler was recorded saying to his closest associates: \"We shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jew.\" [15] Allied knowledge of the atrocities[edit] See also: Raczyński's Note, Witold's Report, and Vrba-Wetzler Report The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland by the Polish government-in-exile addressed to the wartime allies of the then- United Nations in 1942 Upwards of 300 Jewish organizations attempted to provide information to U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt about the persecution of Jews in Europe, but the ethnic and cultural diversity of American immigrant Jewish communities and their comparative lack of political power in the U.S. hindered their ability to influence policy. [16] Various strategies, such as ransoming Jews following the Anschluss of 1938, failed for a host of reasons, not to exclude the unwillingness and inability of Jewish communities in the U.S. to extend financial aid to their suffering brethren. [17] Clear evidence exists that Winston Churchill was privy to intelligence reports derived from decoded German transmissions in August 1941, during which he stated: Whole districts are being exterminated. Scores of thousands – literally scores of thousands – of executions in cold blood are being perpetrated by the German police-troops upon the Russian patriots who defend their native soil. Since the Mongol invasions of Europe in the sixteenth century, there has never been methodical, merciless butchery on such a scale, or approaching such a scale. — Winston Churchill, 24 August 1941. [18] During the early years of the war, the Polish government-in-exile published documents and organised meetings to spread the word about the fate of Jews (see Witold Pilecki 's Report ). In the summer of 1942, a Jewish labor organization (the Bund) leader, Leon Feiner got word to London that 700,000 Polish Jews had already been murdered. The Daily Telegraph published it on 25 June 1942, [19] and the BBC took the story seriously, though the U.S. State Department doubted it. [20] Last page of \"Raczyński's Note \", official note of Polish government-in-exile to Anthony Eden on 10 December 1942. On 10 August 1942, the Riegner Telegram to New York described the Nazi plan to murder all the Jews in the occupied states by deporting them to concentration camps in the east, to be exterminated in one blow, possibly by prussic acid, starting at autumn 1942. It was released in the United States by Stephen Wise of the World Jewish Congress in November 1942 after a long wait for permission from the government. [21] This led to attempts by Jewish organizations to put President Roosevelt under pressure to act on behalf of the European Jews, many of whom had tried in vain to enter either Britain or the U.S. [22] Reports were also coming into Palestine about the German atrocities during the autumn of 1942. [23] The allies received a detailed eyewitness account from Polish resistance fighter and later Georgetown University professor, Jan Karski. On 10 December 1942, the Polish government-in-exile published a 16-page report addressed to the Allied governments, titled The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland.[e] On 17 December 1942, as the answer to Raczyński's Note, the Allies issued the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations, a formal declaration confirming and condemning Nazi extermination policy toward the Jews and describing the ongoing events of the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Europe.[24] The statement was read to British House of Commons in a floor speech by Foreign secretary Anthony Eden.[25] The death camps were discussed between American and British officials at the Bermuda Conference in April 1943. [26] On 12 May 1943, Polish government-in-exile member and Bund leader Szmul Zygielbojm committed suicide in London to protest the inaction of the world with regard to the Holocaust, [27] stating in part in his suicide letter: I cannot continue to live and to be silent while the remnants of Polish Jewry, whose representative I am, are being killed. My comrades in the Warsaw ghetto fell with arms in their hands in the last heroic battle. I was not permitted to fall like them, together with them, but I belong with them, to their mass grave. By my death, I wish to give expression to my most profound protest against the inaction in which the world watches and permits the destruction of the Jewish people. [28] The large camps near Auschwitz were finally surveyed by plane in April 1944. While all important German cities and production centers were bombed by Allied forces until the end of the war, no attempt was made to interdict the system of mass annihilation by destroying pertinent structures or train tracks, even though Churchill was a proponent of bombing parts of the Auschwitz complex. The US State Department was aware of the use and the location of the gas chambers of extermination camps but refused to bomb them. [29] [f] Throughout and after the war, the British government pressed leaders of European nations to prevent illegal Jewish immigration into Palestine and sent ships to block the sea-route to Palestine, turning back many Jewish refugees found attempting to illegally enter the region. [30] German people[edit] Main article: German collective guilt The debate continues on how much average Germans knew about the Holocaust. Robert Gellately, a historian at Oxford University, conducted a widely respected survey of the German media before and during the war and concluded that there was substantial participation and consent from large numbers of ordinary Germans in various aspects of the Holocaust, that German civilians frequently saw columns of slave laborers, and that the basics of the concentration camps, if not the extermination camps, were widely known. [31] The German scholar, Peter Longerich, in a study looking at what Germans knew about the mass murders concluded that: \"General information concerning the mass murder of Jews was widespread in the German population.\" [32] Longerich estimates that before the war ended, 32 to 40 percent of the population had knowledge about mass killings (not necessarily the extermination camps). [33] British historian Nicholas Stargardt presents evidence of widespread public knowledge, agreement, and collusion concerning the destruction of European Jewry, as well of the insane, feeble, disabled, Poles, Roma, and other nationals. [34] His evidence includes speeches by Nazi leaders, [35] which were broadcast or heard by a wide audience that included mention or inferences related to destroying the Jews, along with letters written between soldiers and their families describing the slaughter. [36] Historian Claudia Koonz relates how reports from the Nazi security service (SD) described the public opinion as favorable where it concerned the killing of Jews. [37] Using these same SD reports from the war years, along with a great many memoirs, diaries, and other descriptive material, historian Lawrence D. Stokes concluded that much, although not all, of the terror inflicted on the Jewish people was generally understood in the German public. Marlis Steinert came to an opposite conclusion through her own studies, contending that only a few were aware of the immense scale of the atrocities. [38] French historian, Christian Ingrao, reminds readers that one must take into consideration the possible extent to which SD reports were manipulated by the Nazi propaganda machine when reviewing them. [39] Historian Helmut Walser Smith remarks of the German people: \"They were hardly indifferent to it; the responses range from outrage to affirmation to worry, especially toward the end of the war, when anxiety about accountability increased. That their imagination did not press to the particulars is not astounding. Nor is it astounding that few failed to imagine Auschwitz. The idea that not the killers go to the Jews, but the Jews are delivered up to industrial killing centers—this, in fact, was without historical precedent.\" [40] Historian Eric A. Johnson and sociologist Karl-Heinz Reuband conducted interviews with more than 3,000 Germans and 500 German Jews about daily life in the Third Reich. From the Jewish questionnaires, the authors found that German society was not nearly as rife with antisemitism as one might otherwise have believed, but this changed dramatically with Hitler's ascension to power. [41] German Jews claimed that they knew of the Holocaust from a wide range of sources, which included radio broadcasts from Italy and what they heard from friends or acquaintances, but they did not know details until 1943. [42] Responses from non-Jewish Germans indicate that \"the majority of Germans identified with the Nazi regime.\" [43] Contrary to many other accounts and/or historical interpretations, which portray rule under the Nazis as terrifying for German citizens, most of the German respondents who participated in the interviews stated that they never really feared arrest from the Gestapo. [43] [g] Concerning the mass murder of the Jews, the survey results were contingent to some degree on geography, but roughly 27–29% of Germans had information about the Holocaust at some point before the war's end, and another 10–13% suspected something terrible was happening all along. Based on this information, Johnson and Reuband surmise that one-in-three Germans either heard or knew that the Holocaust was taking place before the end of the war from sources that included family members, friends, neighbors or professional colleagues. [45] Johnson suggests (in disagreement with his co-author) that it is more likely that about 50% of the German population were aware of the atrocities being committed against the Jewish people and other enemies identified by the Nazi regime. [46] During the years 1945 through 1949, polls indicated that a majority of Germans felt that Nazism was a \"good idea, badly applied\". In a poll conducted in the American German occupation zone, 37% replied that 'the extermination of the Jews and Poles and other non-Aryans was necessary for the security of Germans'. [47] [h] Sarah Ann Gordon in Hitler, Germans, and the Jewish Question notes that the surveys are very difficult to draw conclusions from as respondents were given only three options from which to choose: (1) Hitler was right in his treatment of the Jews, to which 0% agreed; (2) Hitler went too far in his treatment of the Jews, but something had to be done to keep them in bounds - 19% agreed; and (3) The actions against the Jews were in no way justified - 77% agreed. She also noted that another revealing example emerges from the question of whether an Aryan who marries a Jew should be condemned, a question to which 91% of the respondents answered \"No\". To the question: \"All those who ordered the murder of civilians or participated in the murders should be made to stand trial\", 94% responded \"Yes\". [48] Historian Tony Judt highlights how denazification and the subsequent fear of retribution from the Allies likely obscured justice due to some of the perpetrators and camouflaged underlying societal truths. [49] Public recollection from Germans about the atrocities was also \"marginalized by postwar reconstruction and diplomacy\" according to historian Nicholas Wachsmann; a delay, which obscured the complexities of understanding both the Holocaust and the concentration camps that aided in its facilitation. [50] Wachsmann notes how the German people often claimed that the crimes occurred behind their backs and were perpetrated by Nazi fanatics, or that they frequently dodged responsibility by equating their suffering with that of the prisoners, avowing they too had been victimized by the National Socialist regime. [51] Initially the memory of the Holocaust was repressed and set aside, but eventually, the young Federal Republic of Germany commenced its own investigations and trials. [52] Political pressure on the prosecutors and judges tempered any extensive probes and very few systematic investigations in the first decade after the war took place. [53] Later research efforts in Germany revealed that there were a \"myriad\" of links between the wider population and the SS camps. [54] In Austria—once part of the Greater German Reich of the Nazis—the situation was much different, as they conveniently evaded accountability through the trope of being the Nazis' first foreign victim. [55] Implementation[edit] During the perpetration of the Holocaust, participants came from all over Europe but the impetus for the pogroms was provided by German and Austrian Nazis. According to Holocaust historian, Raul Hilberg, the \"anti-Jewish work\" of the regime was \"carried out in the civil service, the military, business, and the party\" where \"every specialization was utilized\" and \"every stratum of society was represented in the envelopment of the victims.\" [56] Sobibor death camp guard Werner Dubois stated: I am clear about the fact that annihilation camps were used for murder. What I did was aiding in murder. If I should be sentenced, I would consider that correct. Murder is murder. In weighing the guilt, one should not in my opinion consider the specific function in the camp. Wherever we were posted there: we were all equally guilty. The camp functioned in a chain of functions. If only one element in that chain is missing, the entire enterprise comes to a stop. [57] In an entry in the Friedrich Kellner diary, \"My Opposition \", dated 28 October 1941, the German justice inspector recorded a conversation he had in Laubach with a German soldier who had witnessed a massacre in Poland. [58] [i] French officials at the Parisian branch of the Barclays Bank volunteered the names of their Jewish employees to Nazi authorities, and many of them ended up in the death camps. [59] An insightful perspective is provided by Konnilyn G. Feig, who wrote: Hitler exterminated the Jews of Europe. But he did not do so alone. The task was so enormous, complex, time-consuming, and mentally and economically demanding that it took the best efforts of millions of Germans... All spheres of life in Germany actively participated: Businessmen, policemen, bankers, doctors, lawyers, soldiers, railroad and factory workers, chemists, pharmacists, foremen, production managers, economists, manufacturers, jewelers, diplomats, civil servants, propagandists, film makers and film stars, professors, teachers, politicians, mayors, party members, construction experts, art dealers, architects, landlords, janitors, truck drivers, clerks, industrialists, scientists, generals, and even shopkeepers—all were essential cogs in the machinery that accomplished the final solution. [60] Additional scholars also point out that a wide range of German soldiers, officials, and civilians were in some way involved in the Holocaust, from clerks and officials in the government to units of the army, police, and the SS. [61] [j] Many ministries, including those of armaments, interior, justice, railroads, and foreign affairs, had substantial roles in orchestrating the Holocaust; similarly, German physicians participated in medical experiments and the T-4 euthanasia program as did civil servants; [62] German physicians also made the selections as to who was fit to work and who would die at the concentration camps. [63] Though there was no single department in charge of the Holocaust, the SS and Waffen-SS under Himmler had a leading role and operated with military efficiency in murdering enemies of the Nazi state. From the SS came the SS-Totenkopfverbände concentration camp guard units, the Einsatzgruppen killing squads, and the main administrative offices behind the Holocaust, including the RSHA and WVHA.[64] [65] The regular army participated in the atrocities along with the SS on some occasions by taking part in the massacre of Jews in the Soviet Union, Serbia, Poland, and Greece. The German Army also logistically supported the Einsatzgruppen, helped form the ghettos, ran prison camps, occasionally provided concentration camp guards, transported prisoners to camps, had medical experiments performed on prisoners, and substantially used slave labor. [66] Significant numbers of Wehrmacht soldiers accompanied the SS in their deadly tasks or provided other forms of support for killing operations. [67] The murders by the Einsatzgruppen required cooperation between the Einsatzgruppen chief and Wehrmacht unit commander so they could coordinate and control access to and from the execution grounds. [68] Obedience[edit] Stanley Milgram was one of a number of post-war psychologists and sociologists who tried to address why people obeyed immoral orders in the Holocaust. Milgram's findings demonstrated that reasonable people, when instructed by a person in a position of authority, obeyed commands entailing what they believed to be the suffering of others. After making his results public, Milgram sparked a direct critical response in the scientific community by claiming that \"a common psychological process is centrally involved in both\" his laboratory experiments and the Holocaust. Professor James Waller, Chair of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Keene State College, formerly Chair of Whitworth College Psychology Department, expressed the opinion that Milgram experiments \"do not correspond well\" to the Holocaust events: [69] The subjects of Milgram's experiments were assured in advance that \"no permanent physical damage would result from their actions.\" However, the Holocaust perpetrators were fully aware of their hands-on killing and maiming of the victims. Milgram's guards did not know their victims and were not motivated by racism. On the other hand, the Holocaust perpetrators displayed an \"intense devaluation of the victims\" through a lifetime of personal development. The subjects were not selected for sadism or loyalty to Nazi ideology, and often \"exhibited great anguish and conflict\" in the experiment, unlike the designers and executioners of the Final Solution (see Holocaust trials ), who had a clear \"goal\" on their hands, set beforehand. The experiment lasted for an hour, insufficient time for participants to consider the moral implications of their actions. Meanwhile, the Holocaust lasted for years with ample time for a moral assessment of all individuals and organizations involved. [70] In the opinion of Thomas Blass —who is the author of a scholarly monograph on the experiment (The Man Who Shocked The World) published in 2004—the historical evidence pertaining to actions of the Holocaust perpetrators speaks louder than words: My own view is that Milgram's approach does not provide a fully adequate explanation of the Holocaust. While it may well account for the dutiful destructiveness of the dispassionate bureaucrat who may have shipped Jews to Auschwitz with the same degree of routinization as potatoes to Bremerhaven, it falls short when one tries to apply it to the more zealous, inventive, and hate-driven atrocities that also characterized the Holocaust. [71] Religious hatred and racism[edit] Further information: History of the Jews in Europe, History of the Jews in Germany, Antisemitism in Christianity, Antisemitism in Europe, Martin Luther and antisemitism, Religious antisemitism, and Racial antisemitism Throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, Jews were subjected to antisemitism based on Christian theology, which blamed them for rejecting and killing Jesus.[72] Numerous attempts were made by early Christians to convert the Jews to Christianity in the collective, but when they refused, this made them \"pariahs\" in the eyes of many Europeans. [73] The consequences which they suffered for resisting conversion to Christianity were varied. An extensive series of attacks were committed against Jews as a result of the religious fervor which accompanied the First and Second Crusades (1095–1149). [73] Jews were slaughtered in the wake of the Italian famine (1315–1317), attacked following the outbreak of the Black Death in the Rhineland in 1347, expelled from both England and Italy in the 1290s, from France in 1306 and 1394, from Spain and Portugal in 1492 and 1497. [74] By the time of the Reformation in the 16th century, historian Peter Hayes stresses that \"hatred of Jews was widespread\" throughout Europe. [75] Martin Luther (a German leader of the Protestant Reformation) made a specific written call for harsh persecution of the Jewish people in On the Jews and Their Lies, published in 1543. In it, he urged that Jewish synagogues and schools be set on fire, prayer books destroyed, rabbis forbidden to preach, homes razed, and property and money confiscated. [76] Luther argued that Jews should be shown no mercy or kindness, should have no legal protection and that these \"poisonous envenomed worms\" should be drafted into forced labor or expelled for all time. [77] American historian Lucy Dawidowicz asserted in her book The War Against the Jews that a clear path of antisemitism passes from Luther to Hitler and that \"modern German anti-Semitism is the bastard child of Christian anti-Semitism and German nationalism.\" [78] Even after the Reformation, Catholics and Lutherans continued to persecute Jews, accusing them of blood libels and subjecting them to pogroms and expulsions. [79] [80] The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence of the Völkisch movement in Germany and Austria-Hungary, which was developed and incentivized by authors like Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Paul de Lagarde. The movement presented a pseudo-scientific, biologically based form of racism that viewed Jews as a race whose members were locked in mortal combat with the Aryan race for world domination. [81] Bones of murdered prisoners in the crematoria in the German concentration camp at Weimar, Germany in a photo taken by the 3rd U.S. Army on 14 April 1945 Some authors, such as liberal philosopher Hannah Arendt in The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), [82] Swedish writer Sven Lindqvist, historian Hajo Holborn, and Ugandan academic Mahmood Mandani, have also linked the Holocaust to colonialism, but moreover, place the tragedy into the context of the European tradition of antisemitism and the genocide of colonized peoples. [83] Arendt claimed for instance that nationalism and imperialism were literally bridged together by racism. [84] Pseudo-scientific theories elaborated upon during the 19th century (e.g. Arthur de Gobineau 's 1853 Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races) were fundamental in preparing the conditions for the Holocaust according to some scholars. [85] While other historical episodes of wholesale slaughter exist, there are still scholars who remain adamant about the \"uniqueness\" of the Holocaust, as compared to other genocides.[86] Philosopher Michel Foucault also traced the origins of the Holocaust to \"racial policies\" and \"state racism \", which are subsumed within the framework of \"biopolitics \". [87] The Nazis considered it their duty to overcome natural compassion and execute orders for what they believed to be higher ideals; members of the SS, in particular, perceived that they had a state-legitimized mandate and obligation to eliminate those perceived as racial enemies. [88] Some of the heinous acts committed by the Nazis have been attributed to crowd psychology, and Gustave Le Bon 's The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind (1895) provided influence to Hitler's infamous tome, Mein Kampf.[89] Le Bon claimed that Hitler and the Nazis used propaganda to deliberately shape group-think and related behaviors, especially in cases where people committed otherwise aberrant violent acts due to the anonymity resultant from being a member of the collective. [90] Sadistic acts of this sort were notable in the case of the genocide committed by members of the Croatian Ustashe, whose enthusiasm and sadism in their killings of Serbs appalled the Italians and Germans to the point that the German Army field police \"moved in and disarmed them\" at one point. [91] One might describe the behavior of the Croatians as a sort of quasi-religious eliminationist opportunism, but this same thing might be said of the Germans, whose antisemitism was likewise religious and racialist in nomenclature. [92] A controversy erupted in 1997 when historian Daniel Goldhagen argued in Hitler's Willing Executioners that ordinary Germans were knowing and willing participants in the Holocaust, which he writes, had its roots in a deep racially motivated eliminationist antisemitism that was uniquely manifested in German society. [93] Historians who disagree with Goldhagen's thesis argue that, while antisemitism undeniably existed in Germany, Goldhagen's idea of a uniquely German \"eliminationist\" version is untenable. [94] In complete contrast to Goldhagen's position, historian Johann Chapoutot observes, Culturally speaking, the Nazi ideology advanced by the NSDAP contained only an infinitesimal number of ideas that were genuinely German in origin. Racism, colonialism, anti-Semitism, social Darwinism, and eugenics did not originate between the Rhine and the Memel. Practically speaking, we know the Shoah would have been considerably less murderous if French and Hungarian police forces—not to mention Baltic nationalists, Ukrainian volunteer forces, Polish anti-Semites, and collaborationist politicians, to name only a few—had not supported it so fully and so swiftly: whether or not they knew where the convoys were headed, they were more than happy to rid themselves of their Jewish populations. [95] Functionalism versus intentionalism[edit] Main article: Functionalism versus intentionalism Further information: Historikerstreit Frontispiece of the Nuremberg trials 1940 copy of Mein Kampf A major issue in contemporary Holocaust studies is the question of functionalism versus intentionalism. The terms were coined during the Cumberland Lodge Conference in May 1979 which was entitled, \"The National Socialist Regime and German Society\" by the British Marxist historian Timothy Mason in order to describe two schools of thought about the origins of the Holocaust. [96] Intentionalists hold the view that the Holocaust was the result of a long-term master plan on the part of Hitler, and they also believe that he was the driving force behind it. [97] However, functionalists hold the view that Hitler did not have a master plan for genocide and based on this view, they see the Holocaust as coming from the ranks of the German bureaucracy, with little or no involvement on the part of Hitler. [98] Within the content of Hitler biographies which were written by Joachim Fest and Alan Bullock, one encounters a \"Hitler-centric explanation for genocide\" even though other psycho-historians like Rudolph Binion, Walter Langer, and Robert Waite raised issues about Hitler's ability to make rational decisions; nonetheless, his antisemitism remained unquestioned, the latter authors merely juxtaposed it against his general mental health. [99] Historian and intentionalist Lucy Dawidowicz argued that the Holocaust was planned by Hitler from the very beginning of his political career, which can be traced back to his traumatic experience at the end of the First World War. [100] Other intentionalists, such as Andreas Hillgruber, Karl Dietrich Bracher, and Klaus Hildebrand, have suggested that Hitler had decided upon the Holocaust sometime in the early 1920s. [101] Historian Eberhard Jäckel postulates that the extermination order placed upon the Jews may have occurred during the summer of 1940. [102] Another intentionalist historian, the American Arno J. Mayer, argued that Hitler first ordered the mass murder of the Jews in December 1941, due principally to the failed Blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union. [103] Saul Friedländer has argued that Hitler was an extreme antisemite early on and drove Nazi policy to exterminate the Jews, but he also recognizes the technocratic rationality of the regime that helped bring Hitler's ideological goals to fruition. [104] While others, like Gerhard Weinberg, remain in the intentionalist camp and see Hitler's part as essential to the unfolding of the Final Solution—he also points out the importance of Nazi ideological imperatives such as the Wannsee Conference, and like many scholars, demonstrates that there is still \"much to be discovered and learned.\" [105] Functionalists such as Hans Mommsen, Martin Broszat, Götz Aly, Raul Hilberg, and Christopher Browning hold that the Holocaust was started in 1941–1942 either as a result of the failure of the Nazi deportation policy and/or the impending military losses in Russia. [106] Functionalists contend that what some see as extermination fantasies outlined in Hitler's Mein Kampf and other Nazi literature were simply propaganda and did not constitute concrete plans. In Mein Kampf, Hitler repeatedly states his inexorable hatred of the Jewish people, but nowhere does he proclaim his intention to exterminate them. They also argue that, in the 1930s, Nazi policy aimed at making life so unpleasant for German Jews that they would leave Germany. [107] Adolf Eichmann was in charge of facilitating Jewish emigration by whatever means possible from 1937 [108] until 23 October 1941, when German Jews were forbidden to leave. [109] Functionalists see the SS's support in the late 1930s for Zionist groups as the preferred solution to the \"Jewish Question\" as another sign that there was no masterplan for genocide. Essentially the view of functionalists concerning the Holocaust is that it came about via improvisation as opposed to deliberate planning. [110] To that end, functionalists argue that, in German documents from 1939 to 1941, the term \"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\" was meant to be a \"territorial solution\"; that is, the entire Jewish population was to be expelled somewhere far from Germany. [111] At first, the SS planned to create a gigantic Jewish reservation in the Lublin, Poland area, but the so-called \"Lublin Plan\" was vetoed by Hans Frank, the Governor-General of occupied Poland, who refused to allow the SS to ship any more Jews to the Lublin area after November 1939. The reason Frank vetoed the \"Lublin Plan\" was not due to any humane motives, but rather because he was opposed to the SS \"dumping\" Jews into the Government-General. [112] In 1940, the SS and the German Foreign Office had the so-called \"Madagascar Plan\" to deport the entire Jewish population of Europe to a \"reservation\" on Madagascar.[113] The \"Madagascar Plan\" was canceled because Germany could not defeat the United Kingdom and until their blockade of Nazi-occupied Europe was broken, the \"Madagascar Plan\" could not be put into effect. [114] Finally, functionalist historians have made much of a memorandum written by Himmler in May 1940 explicitly rejecting extermination of the entire peoples as \"un-German\" and recommending to Hitler instead, the \"Madagascar Plan\" as the preferred \"territorial solution\" to the \"Jewish Question\". [115] [116] Not until July 1941 did the term \"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\" come to mean extermination. [117] Recently, a synthesis of the two schools has emerged that has been championed by diverse historians such as the Canadian historian Michael Marrus, the Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer, and the British historian Ian Kershaw that contends Hitler was the driving force behind the Holocaust, but that he did not have a long-term plan and that much of the initiative for the Holocaust came from below in an effort to meet Hitler's perceived wishes. As historian Omer Bartov relates, \"the \"intentionalists\" and \"functionalists\" have gradually come closer, as further research now seems to indicate that the more extreme new interpretations are just as impossible to sustain as the traditional ones.\" [118] Involved[edit] See also: List of major perpetrators of the Holocaust Adolf Hitler[edit] See also: Criticism of Holocaust denial § Hitler's involvement, and Hitler's prophecy Hitler's prophecy speech in the Reichstag, 30 January 1939, during which he threatened \"the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe\". Most historians take the view that Hitler was the opposite of a pragmatist: his overriding obsession was hatred of the Jews, and he showed on a number of occasions that he was willing to risk losing the war to achieve their destruction. There is no \"smoking gun\" in the form of a document that shows Hitler ordering the Final Solution. Hitler did not have a bureaucratic mind and many of his most important instructions were given orally. [119] There is ample documentary evidence, however, that Hitler desired to eradicate Jewry and that the order to do so originated from him, including the authorization for mass deportations of the Jews to the east beginning in October 1941. [120] He cannot have imagined that these hundreds of thousands of Jews would be housed, clothed, and fed by the authorities of the Government-General, and in fact Hans Frank frequently complained that he could not cope with the influx. [121] [122] Historian Paul Johnson writes that some writers, such as David Irving, have claimed that because there were no written orders, \"the Final Solution was Himmler's work and […] Hitler not only did not order it but did not even know it was happening\". Johnson states, however, that \"this argument will not stand up. The administration of the Third Reich was often chaotic but its central principle was clear enough: all key decisions emanated from Hitler.\" [119] According to Kershaw, \"Hitler's authority—most probably given as verbal consent to propositions usually put to him by Himmler—stood behind every decision of magnitude and significance.\" [123] Hitler continued to be closely involved in the \"Final Solution\". [124] Kershaw also points out that, \"in the wake of the German military crisis following the catastrophe at Stalingrad\" that \"Hitler took a direct hand\" in convincing his Hungarian and Romanian allies \"sharpen the persecution\" of the Jews. [125] Hitler's role in the Final Solution was often indirect rather than overt, frequently granting approval rather than initiating. The unparalleled outpourings of hatred were a constant even amid all the policy shifts of the Nazis. They often had propaganda or mobilizing motives, and usually remained generalized. Even so, Kershaw remains adamant that Hitler's role was decisive and indispensable in the unfolding of the \"Final Solution\". [126] In the following widely cited speech made on 30 January 1939, Hitler gave a speech to the Reichstag which included the statement: I want to be a prophet again today: if international finance Jewry in Europe and beyond should succeed once more in plunging the peoples into a world war, then the result will be not the Bolshevization of the earth and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe. [127] On 30 January 1942 at the Sports Palace in Berlin, Hitler told the crowd: And we say that the war will not end as the Jews imagine it will, namely with the uprooting of the Aryans, but the result of this war will be the complete annihilation of the Jews. [128] According to historian Klaus Hildebrand, moral responsibility for the Holocaust resides with Hitler and was nothing less than the culmination of his pathological hatred of the Jews, which for all intents and purposes formed the basis of Nazi genocide and drove the regime to pursue its racial-eliminationist goals. [129] Whether or not Hitler gave a direct order for the implementation of the Final Solution is immaterial and nothing more than a red herring, which fails to recognize Hitler's leadership style, particularly since his verbal commands were sufficient to launch initiatives—due largely to the fact that his subordinates were always \"working towards the Führer\" in an effort to implement \"his totalitarian vision\" even in cases \"without written authority.\" [130] Throughout Gerald Fleming's notable work, Hitler and the Final Solution, he demonstrates that on numerous occasions, Himmler mentioned a \"Führer-Order\" concerning the annihilation of the Jews, which indicates that at the very least, Hitler verbally issued a command on the subject. [131] Journal entries from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels support the position that Hitler was the driving force behind the destruction of the Jews as well; Goebbels wrote that Hitler followed the subject closely and described the Führer as \"uncompromising\" about eliminating the Jews. [132] As historian David Welch asserts, if one takes the scale of the logistical operations that the Holocaust comprised (in the middle of a worldwide war) into consideration alone, it is nearly impossible that the extermination of so many people and the coordination of such an extensive effort could have occurred without Hitler's authorization. [133] Other Nazi leaders[edit] Further information: List of major perpetrators of the Holocaust Heinrich Himmler, Reinhard Heydrich and Karl Wolff at the Berghof, May 1939 Konrad Adenauer 's State Secretary Hans Globke had played a major role in drafting antisemitic Nuremberg Race Laws While significant numbers of Germans and other Europeans collectively participated in the Holocaust, it was Hitler and his Nazi followers who share the greatest responsibility for incentivizing, coercing, and/or overseeing the extermination of millions of people. [134] Among those most responsible for the Final Solution were Heinrich Himmler, Reinhard Heydrich, Adolf Eichmann, Odilo Globocnik, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Heinrich Müller, Theodor Eicke, Richard Glücks, Friedrich Jeckeln, Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger, Rudolf Höss, Christian Wirth, and Oswald Pohl. Key roles were also played by Fritz Sauckel, Hans Frank, Wilhelm Frick and Robert Ley.[135] Other top Nazi leaders such as Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Göring, and Martin Bormann contributed in various ways, whether administratively supporting killing efforts or providing ideological fodder to encourage the Holocaust. [136] For example, Goebbels carried on an intensive antisemitic propaganda campaign and also had frequent discussions with Hitler about the fate of the Jews. [137] He was aware throughout that the Jews were being exterminated, and completely supported this decision. [138] In July 1941, Göring issued a memo to Heydrich ordering him to organise the practical details of a solution to the \"Jewish Question\". This led to the Wannsee Conference held on 20 January 1942, where Heydrich formally announced that genocide of the Jews of Europe was now an official Reich policy. [139] That same year, Bormann signed the decree of 9 October 1942 prescribing that the permanent Final Solution in Greater Germany could no longer be solved by emigration, but only by the use of \"ruthless force in the special camps of the East\", that is, extermination in Nazi death camps.[140] Although the Nazi regime is often depicted as a super-centralized vertically hierarchical state, individual initiative was an important element in how Nazi Germany functioned. [141] Millions of people were rounded up, bureaucratically processed and transported across Europe due to the vigorous initiative of those Nazis most committed to carrying out their duties to the state, an operation involving thousands of officials and a great deal of paperwork. This was a coordinated effort among the SS and its sprawling police apparatus with the Reich ministries and the national railways, all under the supervision of the Nazi Party. [142] Most of the Party's regional leaders (Gauleiters) also knew of the Holocaust since many were present for Himmler's October 1943 speech at Posen, during which he explicitly mentioned the extermination of the Jews. [143] German military[edit] See also: Myth of the clean Wehrmacht The extent to which the officers of the regular German military knew of the Final Solution has been much debated. Political imperatives in postwar Germany led to the army being generally absolved from responsibility, apart from the handful of \"Nazi generals\" such as Alfred Jodl and Wilhelm Keitel who were tried and hanged at Nuremberg. There is an abundance of evidence, however, that the top officers of the Wehrmacht certainly knew about the murders and in a number of instances, approved and/or sanctioned them. [144] The exhibit \"War of Extermination: The Crimes of the Wehrmacht\" [k] showed the extent to which the military was involved in the Holocaust. [145] [146] It was particularly difficult for commanders on the eastern front to avoid knowing what was happening in the areas behind the front. Many individual soldiers photographed the massacres of Jews by the Einsatzgruppen.[147] Some generals and officers, such as Walther von Reichenau, Erich Hoepner, and Erich von Manstein, actively supported the work of the Einsatzgruppen.[148] A number of Wehrmacht units provided direct or indirect assistance to the Einsatzgruppen —all the while mentally normalizing amoral behaviors in the conduct of war through specious justification that they were destroying the Reich's enemies. [149] Many individual soldiers who ventured to the killing sites behind the lines voluntarily participated in the mass shootings. [150] Cooperation between the SS police units and Wehrmacht also occurred when they took hostages and carried out reprisals against partisans, particularly in the Eastern theater, where the war took on the complexion of a racial war as opposed to the conventional one being fought in the West. [151] Other front-line officers went through the war without coming into direct contact with the machinery of extermination, choosing to focus narrowly on their duties and not noticing the wider context of the war. On 20 July 1942, an extermination unit under the command of Walther Rauff was sent to Tobruk and assigned to the Afrika Korps led by Erwin Rommel. However, since Rommel was 500 km away at the First Battle of El Alamein, it is unlikely that the two were able to meet. [152] The plans for Einsatzgruppe Egypt were set aside after the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein.[153] Historian Jean-Christoph Caron opines that there is no evidence that Rommel knew of or would have supported Rauff's mission. [154] Relations between some Army commanders and the SS were not friendly, as officers occasionally refused to co-operate with Himmler's forces; General Johannes Blaskowitz for instance, was relieved of his command after officially protesting about SS atrocities in Poland. [155] [l] Such behaviors were uncommon, however, as a significant portion of the German military acculturated to the norms of the Nazi regime and the SS in particular, and were likewise censurable for carrying out atrocities during the course of the Second World War. [156] Other states[edit] Jewish woman chased by men and youth armed with clubs during the Lviv pogroms, July 1941 Although the Holocaust was planned and directed by Germans, the Nazi regime found willing collaborators in other countries, both those allied to Germany and those under German occupation and by 1942, the atrocities across the continent became a \"pan-European program.\" [157] The civil service and police of the Vichy regime in occupied France actively collaborated in persecuting French Jews. [158] Germany's allies, Italy, Finland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, were all pressured to introduce anti-Jewish measures. Bulgaria refused to co-operate, and all 50,000 Bulgarian Jews survived (though most lost their possessions and many were imprisoned), but thousands of Greek and Yugoslavian Jews were deported from the Bulgarian-occupied territories. [159] Finland officially refused to participate in the Holocaust and only 7 out of 300 Jewish alien refugees were turned over to the Germans. [160] The Hungarian regime of Miklós Horthy also refused to cooperate until the German invasion of Hungary in 1944, after which its 750,000 Jews were no longer safe. [161] Between May through July 1944, upwards of 437,000 Jews were deported from Hungary to Auschwitz. [162] The Romanian regime of Ion Antonescu actively persecuted Jews, murdering some 120,000 of them. [163] [164] The German puppet regime in Croatia actively persecuted Jews on its own initiative. [165] [166] The Nazis enlisted support for their programs in all the countries they occupied, although their recruitment methods differed in various countries according to Nazi racial theories. In the \"Nordic\" countries of Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, and Estonia they tried to recruit young men into the Waffen-SS, with sufficient success to create the \"Wiking\" SS division on the Eastern Front, many of whose members fought for Germany with great fanaticism until the end of the war. [167] In Lithuania and Ukraine, on the other hand, they recruited large numbers of auxiliary troops that were used for anti-partisan work and guard duties at extermination and concentration camps. [168] In recent years, the extent of local collaboration with the Nazis in Eastern Europe has become more apparent. Historian Alan Bullock writes: \"The opening of the archives both in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe has produced incontrovertible evidence [of] ... collaboration on a much bigger scale than hitherto realized of Ukrainians and Lithuanians as well as Hungarians, Croats and Slovaks in the deportation and murder of Jews.\" [169] Historians have been examining the question of whether it is fair to connote the Holocaust as a European Project. Historian Dieter Pohl has estimated that more than 200,000 non-Germans \"prepared, carried out and assisted in acts of murder\"; that is about the same number as Germans and Austrians. [170] Such numbers have elicited a similar reaction from other historians; Götz Aly for instance, has come to the conclusion that the Holocaust was in fact a \"European project.\" [171] While the Holocaust was perpetrated at the urging of the Nazis and constituted part of the SS vision for a \"pan-European racial community\", the subsequent outbursts of antisemitic violence in Croatia, France, Romania, Slovakia, the Baltic states among others, make the catastrophe a \"European project\" according to historian Dan Stone. [172] Belgium[edit] See also: Holocaust in Belgium In Belgium the state has been accused of having actively collaborated with Nazi Germany. An official 2007 report commissioned by the Belgian senate concluded that the Belgians were indeed complicit in participating in the Holocaust. According to the report, the Belgian authorities \"adopted a docile attitude providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy in its treatment of Jews.\" [173] The report also identified three crucial moments that showed the attitude of Belgian authorities toward the Jews: (1) During the autumn of 1940 when they complied with the order of the German occupier to register all Jews even though it was contrary to the Belgium constitution; this led to a number of measures including the firing of all Jews from official positions in December 1940 and the expelling of all Jewish children from their schools in December 1941; [174] (2) In summer 1942, when over one thousand Jews were deported to the death camps, particularly Auschwitz during the month of August. This was only the first of such actions as the deportations to the east continued resulting in the death of some 25,000 people; [175] and (3) At the end of 1945, the Belgian state officials decided that its authorities bore no legal responsibility for the persecution of the Jews, even though many Belgian police officers participated in the rounding up and deportation of Jews. [176] However, collaboration is not the whole story. While there is little doubt that there were strong antisemitic feelings in Belgium, after November 1942, the German roundups became less successful as large-scale rescue operations were carried out by ordinary Belgians. This resulted in the survival of about 25,000 Jews from Belgium. [177] Unlike other states, which were immediately annexed, Belgium was initially placed under German military administration, which the Belgian authorities exploited by refusing to carry out some of the Nazi directives against the Jews. Roughly 60 percent of Belgium's Jews, who were there at the start of the war, survived the Final Solution. [178] Bulgaria[edit] Main articles: The Holocaust in Bulgaria, The Holocaust in North Macedonia, and The Holocaust in Greece Bulgaria, mainly through the influence of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, saved nearly all of its indigenous Jewish population from deportation and certain death. This is not to imply that Bulgaria was entirely blameless, as they passed special laws to confiscate Jewish property and remove them from public service in early 1941. [179] Once civil and military administration over parts of Northern Greece and Macedonia were turned over to Bulgaria by Germany, Bulgarian authorities deported Jews from those territories to concentration camps. Originally SS Captain Theodor Dannecker and the head of the Commissariat for Jewish Affairs, Alexander Belev, agreed to deport as many as 20,000 Jews from Macedonia and Thrace. [180] These deportations were set to be completed by May 1943. [181] Belev had agreed to these measures without the knowledge or approval from officials in the Bulgarian government, which sparked protests that reached the Bulgarian National Assembly in Sofia. [182] Before the matter was over, however, Bulgaria had deported some 11,000 foreign Jews to Nazi-held territory. [183] Once those Jews were handed over to the Germans, they were sent to the extermination camp at Treblinka, where they perished. [184] Channel Islands[edit] See also: German occupation of the Channel Islands Channel Islands police collaborated with the Nazis deporting local Jews, some of whom were sent to Auschwitz in 1942, others were deported in 1943 as retaliation for the British commando raid on the small Channel Island of Sark when most of the Jews were shipped to internment camps in France and Germany. [185] On the Channel Island of Alderney a labor camp for Jews was established, one which was notable for the brutality of the German guards; hundreds of Jews were murdered there and 384 were buried within the camp itself, while many others were simply dumped into the sea. [186] Some 250—mostly French—Jews perished on a ship headed from Germany to the Alderney camp when it was sunk by the Royal Navy on 4 July 1944. [187] Croatia[edit] See also: The Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia Ante Pavelić greeting the Croatian parliament in February 1943 Croatia was a puppet state which was created by the Germans and ruled by the vehemently racist head of the Ustasha, [m] Ante Pavelić. [188] As early as May 1941, the Croatian government forced all Jews to wear the yellow badge and by the summer of that same year, they enacted laws that excluded them from both the economy and society. [189] [190] The Croatian Ustaše regime killed thousands of people, the majority of whom were Serbs, (estimates vary widely, but most modern and qualified sources put the number of people who were killed at around 45,000 to 52,000), about 12,000 to 20,000 Jews and 15,000 to 20,000 Roma, [191] primarily in the Ustasha's Jasenovac concentration camp which was located near Zagreb.[192] Historians Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia provide higher estimates for the number of people who were killed, reporting the following ranges: 500,000 Serbs, 25,000 Gypsies, and 32,000 Jews; most of whom (75%) were murdered, not by the Nazis but by the Croatians themselves. [193] [n] According to the 2001 census in Croatia, only 495 Jews were listed of the 25,000 Jews who had previously lived there before the Second World War, accounting for less than 1/10th of one percent of Croatia's population. [194] Denmark[edit] Further information: Rescue of the Danish Jews Due in part to the fact that the Germans were dependent upon an \"uninterrupted supply of Danish agricultural products to the Reich\" they tolerated the status quo of 6,500 Jews living unmolested in Denmark. [195] Upset with German policies and wishing for democracy, the Danes began demonstrating against the Germans, which incited a military response from the Nazis that included dismantling the Danish military forces and correspondingly placing Danish Jews at increased risk. [196] Most of the Danish Jews were saved by the unwillingness of the Danish government and people to acquiesce to the demands of the occupying forces and through their concerted efforts to ferry Danish Jews to Sweden during October 1943. [197] In total, this endeavor saved nearly 8,000 Jews from certain death; another 425 who were sent to Theresienstadt [o] were also saved due to the determination of the Danes, and returned to their homes following the war. [199] About 1,500 of the roughly 8,000 Jews rescued by the Danes were recent refugees from Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Germany. [200] Estonia[edit] See also: Holocaust in Estonia Prior to the Second World War, there were approximately 5,000 Estonian Jews. [201] With the Nazi invasion of the Baltics, the Nazi government found willing volunteers from this region to assist the Einsatzgruppen and auxiliary police, which enabled it to carry out mass genocide in this region. [202] About 50% of Estonia 's Jewish population, aware of the fate that otherwise awaited them following the Nazi invasion, managed to escape to the Soviet Union; [203] virtually all those remaining were forced to wear badges identifying them as Jews, stripped of their property, and eventually murdered by Einsatzgruppe A and local collaborators before the end of 1941. [204] Right-wing Estonian units, known as the Omakaitse were among those who aided the Einsatzgruppen in murdering Jews. [205] During the winter of 1941–1942, Einsatzgruppe A operating in Ostland and the Army Group Rear reported having murdered 2,000 Jews in Estonia. [206] At the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, Estonia was reported to be Jew-free.[205] Jews from countries outside the Baltics were shipped there to be exterminated—as was the case for 7,130 Jews sent to Estonia in September 1943, where they were murdered within months. [207] An estimated 20,000 Jews were sent to labor camps in Estonia from elsewhere in Eastern Europe. [208] Finland[edit] Further information: Einsatzkommando Finnland Despite being at times a co-belligerent of Nazi Germany, Finland remained independent and its leadership flatly refused to cooperate with Heinrich Himmler's request to relinquish its 2,000 Jews. [160] Some Jews were even able to flee German-occupied Europe and make their way into Finland. [209] Only seven of the 300 alien Jews living in Finland were turned over to the Germans. [160] Even the deportation of a handful of Jews did not go unnoticed, as there were protests in Finland from members of its indigenous Social Democratic Party, by a number of Lutheran ministers, the Archbishop, and the Finnish Cabinet. [210] Like Denmark, Finland was one of only two countries in the orbit of Nazi domination that refused to cooperate fully with Hitler's regime. [211] These historical observations do not absolve all Finns, as some scholars point out—in particular, the Einsatzkommando Finnland was formed during the joint invasion of the Soviet Union, which received collaboration from Finnish police units and Finnish military intelligence in capturing partisans, Jews, and Soviet POWs as part of their operations— exactly how many of each group remains unclear and is a subject needing further research according to historian Paul Lubotina. [212] France[edit] See also: Holocaust in France Antisemitism, as the Dreyfus Affair had shown at the end of the 19th century, was widespread in France, especially among anti-republican sympathizers. [213] Long before the rise of the Nazis, antisemitism was so pronounced in France that, according to intellectual historian George Mosse, France seemed like it would be the country where racism might direct its political future. [214] Before the onset of World War II, there were roughly 350,000 Jews residing in France, with only 150,000 being native-born. Approximately 50,000 were refugees fleeing Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, while another 25,000 came to France from Belgium and Holland; the remaining Jews were arrivals to France in the 1920s and 30s from Eastern Europe. [215] Once the Germans invaded, many Jews fled away from the advancing forces, but France's rapid collapse, both militarily and politically, the armistice, and the speed at which everything happened trapped many of them in southern France. [216] Philippe Pétain, who became the French premier after Paris had fallen to the German Army, arranged the surrender to Germany. [217] He then became the head of the Vichy government, which collaborated with the Nazis, claiming that it would soften the hardships of occupation. [218] Opposition to the German occupation of northern France and the collaborationist Vichy government was left to the French Resistance within France and the Free French Forces led by Charles de Gaulle outside France. [219] German occupation was quickly accompanied by harsh treatment; Jews were expelled from Alsace-Lorraine and their property was confiscated, whereas foreign Jews—around 32,000—were interned following a Vichy decree on 4 October 1940. [220] Additional discriminatory measures soon followed and intensified after the Nazis issued an ordinance on 27 September 1940; these were carried out by the French administration and included: identification requirements for Jews, a census to account for all Jews and businesses, expropriation and \"Aryanization\" of property, along with occupational restrictions and bans. [220] On 7 October 1940, Pétain's government repealed the Crémieux Decree, a move which deprived 117,000 Algerian-born French Jews of the civil rights they were granted in 1870. [221] By the end of 1940, more Jews were arrested in Vichy France than in German-occupied France.[222] Another 1,112 Jews were arrested during French round-ups in May and December 1941; later, when they were deported, they constituted some of the earliest arrivals to Auschwitz at the end of March 1942. [223] Five thousand additional Jews were sent from France to Auschwitz at the end of April and during June 1942. [224] The chief of police for the Vichy government, René Bousquet, agreed to arrest foreign and stateless Jews in Vichy France starting in July 1942, and he acceded to having French police collaborate in arresting Jews in the occupied zone.[225] Per agreement between the Vichy government and the Nazis, another 10,000 Jews were added to the total being deported between 19 July and 7 August 1942. [226] Some 2,000 Jewish children whose parents had already been shipped to Auschwitz were also sent to the camp during the period 17–26 August 1942, and by the end of the year, the total figure of deportees from France reached 42,000 persons. [227] From the first transport of March 1942 to the last one during July 1944, as many as 77,911 Jews were deported from France to Poland. [228] [p] Most of the Jews in France were transported to Auschwitz, but some were sent to Majdanek and Sobibór with a few ending up at Buchenwald.[230] Greece[edit] Further information: Axis occupation of Greece during World War II § The Holocaust in Greece The Jews of Greece mainly lived in the area around Thessaloniki, where a large and influential Sephardi community had lived since the 15th century, where some 55,000 Jews comprised nearly 20% of the city. [231] Following the German invasion and occupation of Salonika in 1941, an antisemitic nationalist party called National Union of Greece (Ethniki Enosis Ellados, EEE), which had existed between 1927 and 1935, was revived by Nazi authorities. [232] [q] The Greek governor, Vasilis Simonides, cooperated with the Nazi authorities and supplied local police forces to aide in deporting 48,500 Jews from Salonika to Auschwitz-Birkenau during March to August 1943. [234] Both Greeks and Germans looted the businesses and homes vacated by the expelled Jews. [180] Greek Jews residing in the areas occupied by Bulgaria were also deported following the deportations from Salonika. In March 1944, German forces and Greek police in Athens rounded up Jews and deported them. Upwards of 2,000 Jews from Corfu and another 2,200 from Rhodes were transported to concentration camps in June 1944. [235] Before the end of the war, over 60,000 Greek Jews were murdered, the vast majority of whom were sent to Auschwitz. [236] Hungary[edit] Further information: Hungarian Jews § Toward the Holocaust Captured Jewish women in Wesselényi Street, Budapest, Hungary on 20–22 October 1944 In March 1938, several years before the German occupation of Hungary, anti-Jewish measures were already enacted by the Hungarian Parliament in the wake of Prime Minister Kálmán Darányi 's announcement about the need to solve the Jewish question. [237] This legislation and the second set of anti-Jewish laws restricted Jews from certain professions and economic sectors, it also forbade Jews from becoming Hungarian citizens by means of either marriage, naturalization, or legitimization. Approximately 90,000 Jews and their family members who relied on their support (upwards of 220,000 people) lost their means of economic survival and when the third anti-Jewish law went into effect, it nearly mirrored the Nazi Nuremberg Laws. [238] Once the legal exclusion of Jews from Hungarian society was complete, the National Central Alien Control Office (Külföldieket Ellenőrző Országos Központi Hatóság, KEOKH), turned its attention almost exclusively to expelling \"undesirable\" Jews. [239] By the summer of 1941, the Hungarians carried out their first series of mass murders, and again in early January 1942, when they slaughtered 2,500 Serbs and 700 Jews, demonstrating that the political leadership in Hungary authorized the commission of atrocities even before the German occupation. [240] Sometime in August 1941, the Hungarian authorities deported 16,000 \"alien\" Jews, most of whom were shot by the SS and Ukrainian collaborators. [241] In the spring of 1942, the Hungarian Minister of Defense ordered the majority of Jewish forced labor to the theater of military operations. Due to this order, as many as 50,000 Jews worked in military forced-labor companies starting in the spring of 1942 through 1944. [242] Accompanying Hungarian troops during Operation Barbarossa, Jews in these units were poorly treated, insufficiently housed, ill-fed, routinely used to clear minefields, and placed in constant unnecessary danger; estimates indicate that \"at least 33,000 Hungarian Jewish males in the prime of life\" died in Russia. [243] During parts of May through June 1944, some 10,000 Hungarian Jews were gassed on a daily basis at Auschwitz-Birkenau, a pace with which the crematoria could not keep up, resulting in many of the bodies being burned in open pits. [244] The 410,000 Jews murdered during this period represents the \"largest single group of Jews murdered after 1942\" according to historian Christian Gerlach.[245] Much of the efficiency with which the Germans were able to deport and murder Hungarian Jews stemmed from the \"frictionless cooperation of Hungary's politicians, bureaucracy, and gendarmerie\", and popular Hungarian antisemitism served to block any Jews trying to escape. [246] After the fascist Arrow Cross coup in October 1944, Arrow Cross militias shot as many as 20,000 Jews in Budapest and dumped their bodies into the Danube River between December 1944 and the end of January 1945. [247] Jews in labor battalions were sent on death marches into Germany and Austria. [248] Nearly one-tenth of the Holocaust's Jewish victims were Hungarian Jews, accounting for a total of over 564,000 deaths; some 64,000 Jews had already been murdered prior to the German occupation of Hungary. [249] Despite the atrocities in Hungary, approximately 200,000 Jews in total survived the war. [250] Italy[edit] See also: Jews of Libya during the Holocaust Among Germany's allies, Italy was not known for its antisemitism and had a relatively well-assimilated Jewish population; its policies were essentially about domination as opposed to \"destruction.\" [251] National pride and the need to express sovereignty had as much to do with Italian behaviors as did any general benevolence towards the Jews. [251] Approximately 57,000 Jews resided in pre-war Italy, about 10,000 of whom were refugees from Austria and Germany, comprising less than one-tenth of one percent of the population. [252] An Italian law was passed in 1938 as part of Mussolini's effort to align his country more with Germany; the law restricted civil liberties of Jews. This effectively reduced the country's Jews to second-class status, though the Italians never made it official policy to deport Jews to concentration camps. Edging closer towards Germany, the Italian Ministry of the Interior established 43 camps where enemy \"aliens\" (to include Jews) were detained—these camps were not pleasant but they were \"a far cry from the Nazi concentration camps.\" [253] After the fall of Benito Mussolini and the Italian Social Republic, Jews started being deported to German camps by the Italian puppet regime, which issued a police order to that effect on 30 November 1943. [254] While Jews fled once the puppet regime came to power, the Italian police nonetheless captured and sent over 7,000 Jews to camps at Fossoli di Carpi and Bolzano, both of which served as assembly points for deportations to Auschwitz-Birkenau. [255] Italian prisons were used to house Jews as well, the most infamous of them was San Vittore Prison in Milan where \"torture and murder were common.\" [256] Nazi Germany's Propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels, complained throughout the war about Italy's \"lax\" policies against the Jews. [257] Nevertheless, through 1944, no less than 15 transports carrying around 3,800 Jews made their way from Italy to Auschwitz. [258] Estimates from a number of sources place the total death count for Italian Jews between 6,500 and 9,000. [259] The generally accepted death tolls for Italy are about 8,000 Jews and as many as 1,000 Roma. [260] Latvia[edit] See also: Holocaust in Latvia Members of a Latvian self-defence unit assemble a group of Jewish women for execution on a beach near Liepāja, 15 December 1941 Before the war over 93,000 Jews resided in Latvia, comprising less than 5 percent of the country's population. [261] Immediately in the wake of the German attack on the former Soviet Union in June 1941, Latvia was occupied and incorporated into the Reichskommissariat Ostland as Generalbezirk Lettland with a Latvian civil administration under the D. Heinrich Drechsler. [262] Latvian auxiliary forces aided the SS Einsatzgruppen by following behind the advancing German forces, shooting Jews who they lined up in anti-tank trenches. [263] Other instances of Latvian brutality against the Jews manifested before troops even arrived, as the local populations attacked and murdered entire communities across hundreds of small villages. [264] Zealous Latvians assisted the German forces in collecting all males between the ages of 16 and 60 in the city of Dvinsk for support operations; hundreds of Jewish males never returned from these duties as they were often murdered. [265] In the areas in and around Warsaw, Latvian guards accompanied the SS in securing the ghetto and deporting Jews to Treblinka. [266] The former head of the Latvian police, Viktors Arājs, willingly collaborated with the Nazis by forming the Arājs Kommando, a Latvian volunteer police unit, which worked closely with the SS Einsatzgruppe A to murder Jews. [267] As early as July 1941, they were already burning synagogues in Riga. [268] According to historian Timothy Snyder, the Arājs Kommando shot 22,000 Latvian Jews at various locations after they had been brutally rounded up for this purpose by the regular police and auxiliaries, and were responsible for assisting in the murder of some 28,000 more Jews. [269] Aggregate figures indicate that around 70,000 Latvian Jews were murdered during the Holocaust. [206] Liechtenstein[edit] Only a handful of Jews lived in the small neutral state of Liechtenstein at the outbreak of the Second World War. [r] Between 1933 and 1945, approximately 400 Jews were taken in by Liechtenstein, but another 165 were turned away. [271] According to a 2005 study, the royal family of Liechtenstein purchased once Jewish-owned property and furniture that the Nazis seized after annexing Austria and Czechoslovakia. Liechtenstein's royal family also rented inmates from Strasshof an der Nordbahn concentration camp near Vienna, where they employed forced labor on nearby royal estates. [272] Lithuania[edit] See also: Holocaust in Lithuania Kaunas pogrom in German-occupied Lithuania, June 1941 Nearly 7 percent of Lithuania's population was Jewish, totaling approximately 160,000 persons. [273] For the most part, the Nazis considered the majority of non-Jewish people in the Baltics as racially assimilable with the exception of Jews, against whom some discrimination was already present in Lithuania before the occupation, but it was generally confined to edicts against Jews being in certain occupations and/or educational discrimination. [274] Lithuania's Jewish population quickly swelled in the aftermath of the territorial arrangement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which proved a tumultuous time for many Jews who fled there to escape persecution; meanwhile, it increased the Jewish population of Lithuania to approximately 250,000. [275] Angry about the Nazi-Soviet pact, many Lithuanians began taking their anger out on the country's Jews by attacking them and their property. [276] The situation deteriorated further due to the see-saw of political power that started when the Soviet Army took control of Lithuania in June 1940 and persecuted thousands of its citizens through a program of Sovietization (approximately 17,000 Lithuanians were sent to Siberia right before the Germans arrived). [277] Many Jews were asked to join the short-lived Soviet government and were allowed integration into Lithuanian society. Just seven weeks later, however, the Nazis invaded and were greeted as liberators. Subsequent blame for the ill fortune that befell the Lithuanians under the Soviets landed on the Jews, which started even before the Germans had finished conquering the country; [278] Lithuanians carried out pogroms in at least 40 different places, where Jews were raped, severely injured, and murdered. [279] Blaming the Jews also afforded any Lithuanians who had cooperated with the Soviets the means to exonerate themselves by diverting attention onto a Jewish conspiratorial scapegoat. [280] On 25 June 1941 Nazi forces arrived in Kaunas, where they witnessed local Lithuanians drag about 50 male Jews into the center of the city while one Lithuanian man beat them to death with a crowbar (cheered on by spectators) in a public display of brutality that shocked many Germans. After murdering all the Jews, the man climbed atop their corpses and played the Lithuanian national anthem on an accordion. [281] These deaths were part of the Kaunas pogrom during which many thousands of Jews were murdered by the Nazis with local acquiesance or assistance. [282] Mere weeks after arrival, the Nazis instituted a systematic campaign to eliminate the Jews of Lithuania by identifying them, rounding them up, guarding them, and transporting them to extermination sites—during which they were aided by Lithuanian soldiers and police. [283] The pace of murder increased and spread across Lithuania as the Germans consolidated their rule, sometimes by way of Lithuanian initiative, other times triggered at the arrival of Sipo-SD contingents. [284] Within the last 6 months of 1941 following the June invasion by Germany, the majority of Lithuanian Jews were executed, the biggest crime being the Ponary massacre.[285] The remnants trapped in ghettos were killed in occupied Lithuania and sent to Nazi death camps in Poland. [286] By the end of June 1941, around 80 percent of Lithuania's Jews had been \"wiped out.\" [287] Scholars believe the overall Holocaust-related death rate in Lithuania was approximately 90 percent, making Nazi-occupied Lithuania the European territory with the lowest proportion of Jewish survivors from World War II. While estimates vary, the number of Lithuanian Jews murdered in the Holocaust is assessed to be between 195,000 and 196,000. [288] Additionally, Lithuanian auxiliary police troops assisted in murdering Jews in Poland, Belarus and Ukraine. [289] One distinguished Lithuanian historian claims that there were five motivational factors eliciting participation in the atrocities by his countrymen. These were: (1) revenge against those who aided the Soviets; (2) expiation for those who wanted to demonstrate loyalty to the Nazis after collaborating previously with the Soviets; (3) antisemitism; (4) opportunism; and (5) self-enrichment. [290] Netherlands[edit] See also: History of the Jews in the Netherlands Known prior to the war for racial and religious tolerance, the Netherlands had taken in Jews since the 16th century, many of whom had found refuge there after fleeing Spain. [291] Before the German invasion of May 1940, approximately 140,000 Jews resided in the Netherlands, around 30,000 of them were refugees from Austria and Germany. [292] Nearly 60 percent of Dutch Jews lived in Amsterdam, constituting some 80,000 people. [293] Once the Nazis invaded, a host of antisemitic measures were enacted to include exclusion from professions like the civil service. [294] Anti-Jewish legislation that had taken years to institute in Germany was enacted within just months in the Netherlands. [295] On 22 October 1940, all Jewish banks and businesses had to register and all assets, whether private or those in banks, had to be declared. [296] Even radio sets in possession of Jews were forbidden and confiscated. [297] By January 1941, the Jews of the Netherlands were being defined by racist criteria, had to be registered, and merely a month later in February, many were being deported to Westerbork transit camp in the eastern part of the country. From there, most Dutch Jews were first sent to Mauthausen concentration camp.[297] While there was participation from some Dutch volunteers in various acts against the Jews, there was more of a tacit and begrudging acquiesance in the Netherlands, which required a very visible Nazi presence throughout the entire war to exploit the country's economic wealth and enforce Nazi occupation policies. [298] [s] From the summer of 1942 forward, upwards of 102,000 Dutch Jews were deported and murdered—much of which was made possible by the \"cooperation and efficiency of the Dutch civil service and police\" who willingly served the Germans. [300] Not only was there relatively smooth cooperation between Dutch authorities and Dutch police, the SS and the Nazi police organizations in the Netherlands also worked well together there; additionally, volunteers from indigenous fascist organizations assisted in persecuting Jews, and the Jewish council in Amsterdam, unfortunately, spread undue optimism and as a result, very few Dutch Jews went into hiding. [301] In all fairness to the Jewish council, however, they were deceived and provided misinformation by the Nazi commissioner for Amsterdam, Hans Böhmcker. [302] Historians Deborah Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt report that in the Netherlands, nearly 80% of the 140,000 Jews originally living there were murdered. [303] [t] [u] Norway[edit] Further information: The Holocaust in Norway and History of the Jews in Norway Amid a prewar population of 3 million, there were only 2,100 Jews living there, the largest contingency residing in Oslo.[305] After Norway was invaded, the Nazis took control of the government by June 1940 and the native government went into exile. [306] Power was given to the German Reichskommissar Josef Terboven and the Norwegian Fascist Party leader Vidkun Quisling, who supported the institution of anti-Jewish legislation. [307] Quisling attempted to establish himself as the ruler of occupied Norway, but the Nazis only used him as leader of a puppet government.[308] Like in Denmark, radios were confiscated from Jews by Norwegian police in May 1940. [309] On 20 April 1940, SS Einsatzkommandos were established in Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger, Kristiansand, and Trondheim. [309] The Nazis, assisted by Norwegian police units, managed to round up 763 Jews, who were deported to Auschwitz where they were murdered. [310] Another 930 Jews escaped to Sweden from Norway. [311] However, the Nazis and their collaborators were very unpopular in Norway and many Jews were saved by the actions of Norwegians, including civil servants and police officers. [312] Quisling and other Norwegians, who collaborated with the Nazis, were executed as traitors after the war, at least partly due to their involvement in the Holocaust. [313] Palestine[edit] A Palestinian Arab nationalist and a Muslim religious leader, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini worked for Nazi Germany as a propagandist and a recruiter of Muslim volunteers for the Waffen-SS and other units. [314] On 28 November 1941, Hitler officially received al-Husseini in Berlin. [315] Hitler told al-Husseini of the Germans' \"uncompromising fight against the Jews\", which included the Jews in Arab territories. [316] The Mufti spent the remainder of the war assisting with the formation of Muslim Waffen-SS units in the Balkans and the formation of schools and training centers for imams and mullahs who would accompany the Muslim SS and Wehrmacht units. [317] Beginning in 1943, al-Husseini was involved in the organization and recruitment of Bosnian Muslims into several divisions. The largest of which was the 13th \"Handschar\" division.[318] Poland[edit] See also: The Holocaust in Poland Polish Jews comprised roughly 10 percent of the country's population at upwards of 3.3 million persons before the Second World War began, most of whom were well-integrated into Polish society in various industries. [319] Most Polish Jews lived in the cities and were self-employed. [320] Economic depression during the 1920s and 30s changed the situation for Jews in Poland, as a subsequent emergence of antisemitism yielded government programs to reduce their economic standing. [321] German occupation in 1939 only worsened matters for the Jews, as they started isolating them by forcing them into ghettos, eventually transporting them to camps established in Poland itself. [322] Far right-wing party members in Poland saw the deportation of the Jews in a favorable light, but for the majority of Poles, their thoughts on the matter were far more complex. [323] When the Nazis attacked the Red Army in Soviet-occupied Poland during Operation Barbarossa of 1941, witnesses recalled a series of massacres committed against Jews by the Polish locals in the Białystok and Łomża areas, such as in Jedwabne, Radziłów, and Kolno villages, along with several others in the area. [324] The extent of local collaboration in these massacres is a controversial issue, as is the role of German units present there. [325] [326] Historian Peter Longerich points out that \"even if the pogroms can be attributed in large part to German plans to spark off 'attempts at self-cleansing', it has to be admitted that they would not have been possible if there had not already been a significant potential for anti-Semitic violence in the indigenous population and if they had not been susceptible to mobilization for such murderous campaigns.\" [327] This is also true of Jedwabne, \"[which] was engineered by a unit of the German Security Police... [which] had recruited local Poles as auxiliary 'pogrom police' for this purpose.\" [328] According to Timothy Snyder, there were about a dozen pogroms instigated by the Nazis' arrival in Poland, resulting in several thousand deaths, but \"the scale of the murder was...inferior to what the Germans were already achieving to the north and east.\" [329] There were multiple occurrences of individual Volksdeutsche turning in, chasing down, or blackmailing Jews; such people were condemned as collaborators and under threat of execution by the Polish resistance. Emmanuel Ringelblum wrote that he saw Polish Blue Police beating Jews and that they participated in street round-ups. [330] But according to Raul Hilberg, \"Of all the native police forces in occupied Eastern Europe, those of Poland were least involved in anti-Jewish actions... They [the Polish Blue Police] could not join the Germans in major operations against Jews or Polish resistors, lest they be considered traitors by virtually every Polish onlooker.\" [331] Poland never surrendered to the Germans so there was no collaboration on a national governmental level as took place elsewhere in occupied Europe. There also were no Polish SS battalions, though there were SS volunteer battalions from almost all of the other German-occupied countries. Attempts to organize Polish SS battalions resulted in immediate, large-scale desertions, and so these attempts were abandoned. [332] Polish Jew, Nechama Tec, an expert on the Holocaust who herself was saved by Polish Catholics, writes that she knew of no Polish concentration camp guards. [333] In general the machinery of the Holocaust ran with little Polish collaboration, though collaboration did take place on occasion as Yisrael Gutman and Shmuel Krakowski reported in their work Unequal Victims that a notable number of Poles turned their backs on the Jews, extorted them (see Szmalcownik ), and in the rural parts of Poland, peasants joined the Germans in hunting down and killing Jews who escaped from ghettos. [334] They also claim that there were more bystander crimes than those willing to aide the Jews. [334] Nonetheless, Polish citizens have the world's highest count of individuals recognized as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem; a list consisting of Gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews from extermination during the Holocaust. [335] Nonetheless, due to its European centrality, available rail networks, and proximity to Nazi avenues of control, Poland was the nation where German persecution policies against the Jews were played out in full. [336] German-occupied Poland had the most ghettos, the only camps designed exclusively for extermination, and trains from all across northern, southern, and western Europe carried Jewish deportees into the country. [337] There were over 450 extermination, concentration, labor, and prisoner-of-war camps in Poland. [338] It was also the nation where the infamous killing centers of Belzec, Chelmno, Sobibor, Treblinka, Majdanek, and Auschwitz-Birkenau were located. [339] Before the killing came to its conclusion, upwards of ninety percent of all Poland's Jews—amounting to some three-million persons in total—were murdered by the Nazis. [340] Romania[edit] Main article: History of the Jews in Romania § The Holocaust Assimilation was common for Jews in Romania, where some 757,000 of them lived but not necessarily in total peace there. Following the First World War, attacks against Jews intensified, as many Jews were stripped of citizenship. According to historian Lucy Dawidowicz, economic discrimination as well as violent antisemitism was present in Romania concomitant with Germany. [341] Similar to Germany, Jews were forbidden full participation in Romanian society and culture, and under Antonescu the Romanianization of Jewish property was carried out, Jews were forbidden gainful employment, made to work as forced laborers, and a process of ghettoization and deportation was begun. [342] Leading figures in Romania's antisemitic movement included the economics professor, Alexander Cuza, who founded the Fascist League of National Christian Defense, an organization that begat the notorious Iron Guard under Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.[343] Cuza wanted to expel all Jews out of Romania; poet Octavian Coga wished to send them to Madagascar. The fascist Alexandru Razmerita advocated imprisoning the Jews in concentration camps and working them to death, while a Romanian Orthodox priest suggested drowning them all in the Black Sea.[343] Copying the Nazis, the Romanian government enacted its version of the Nuremberg Laws in 1936. [344] Iron Guard leader Codreanu once exclaimed that he was in favor of \"eliminating the Jews completely, totally and without exception.\" [345] [v] The Romanian Antonescu regime was responsible for the deaths of approximately 380,000 Jews according to historian Yehuda Bauer. [347] An official declaration by the Romanian government that denied the existence of the Holocaust within the country's borders during World War II led in 2003 to the creation of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania.[348] The official report of the Commission released jointly with the Romanian government concluded: The Commission concludes, together with the large majority of bona fide researchers in this field, that the Romanian authorities were the main perpetrators of this Holocaust, in both its planning and implementation. This encompasses the systematic deportation and extermination of nearly all the Jews of Bessarabia and Bukovina as well some Jews from other parts of Romania to Transnistria, the mass killings of Romanian and local Jews in Transnistria, the massive execution of Jews during the Iasi pogrom; the systematic discrimination and degradation applied to Romanian Jews during the Antonescu administration — including the expropriation of assets, dismissal from jobs, the forced evacuation from rural areas and concentration in district capitals and camps, and the massive utilization of Jews as forced laborers under the same administration. Jews were degraded solely on account of their Jewish origin, losing the protection of the state and becoming its victims. A portion of the Roma population of Romania was also subjected to deportation and death in Transnistria. [w] Iași pogrom in Romania, June 1941 In cooperation with German Einsatzgruppen and Ukrainian auxiliaries, Romanian troops murdered hundreds of thousands of Jews in Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and Transnistria; some of the larger massacres of Jews occurred at Bogdanovka, a Romanian concentration camp along the Bug River in Transnistria, between 21 and 30 December 1941. [349] Nearly 100,000 Jews were murdered in occupied Odessa [350] and well over 10,000 were murdered in the Iași pogrom of June 1941. [351] Romanian troops also massacred Jews in the Domanevka and Akhmetchetka concentration camps. [352] [x] Jean Ancel, who headed the commission along with Elie Wiesel, spent his entire life researching Romania's treatment of Jews. In his book, he provides a confirmation using Romania's own archives, made available in 1994–95 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and with Nazi documents, survivor testimonies, war crimes trial transcripts, that Romania not only participated in but independently implemented its own autonomous genocide of Jews in Bessarabia, Bukovina, and in Ukraine—the only Nazi ally to do so during the war. [353] The protests of various public, political and religious figures, including Prince Constantin Karadja, against the deportation of the Jews from the Romanian Kingdom contributed to the change of policy toward the Jews starting with October 1942. [354] The result of this change of policy and that of the actions of a relatively small number of individuals, was that at least 290,000 Romanian Jews survived. [355] Serbia[edit] See also: The Holocaust in Serbia Before the First World War, Serbia existed as an independent country before being incorporated into Yugoslavia in 1919. Approximately 16,000 Jews resided there. [356] During the interwar years, Serbia constituted one of the places where it was comparatively safe to be a Jew, despite the presence of some general xenophobia. [357] Serbia was occupied by Germany in April 1941. [67] As part of their effort to occupy the northern regions of Yugoslavia, the Germans established a military government in Serbia. [358] Serbia's collaborationist government was led by General Milan Nedić.[359] The internal affairs of the Serbian-occupied territory were moderated by German racial laws, that were introduced in all occupied territories with immediate effects on the Jewish and Roma populations. [360] Indigenous Serbians who harbored democratic beliefs were also targeted. [361] Partisan activities in Serbia elicited harsh pacification measures from the SD and Wehrmacht. [362] [y] The Nazis had a collective punishment policy of killing 100 Serbs for each German soldier killed and another 50 Serbs for every German soldier who was wounded. [356] Resistance activities continued for some time in Serbia nonetheless. [364] Sometimes the Serbian authorities cooperated with the Germans as matter of course, whereas others took the individual initiative; some Serbian military commanders rounded up Gypsies so they could be concentrated in one area, where they were shot. [365] German occupiers declared Serbia Judenfrei in August 1942. [366] The major concentration camps in Serbia were Sajmište and Banjica but many others like Topovske Šupe, Šabac, and Niš concentration camps also interned considerable numbers of Jews. [367] Before the war was concluded, upwards of 14,500 Serbian Jews were murdered. [368] Legends about Serbs saving the Jews in World War II are widespread in Serbia, and 132 Serbs have been honored as Righteous Among the Nations.[335] Slovakia[edit] Main article: The Holocaust in Slovakia Adolf Hitler with Slovak President Josef Tiso in 1941 In 1938 approximately 135,000 Jews resided in Slovakia, around 40,000 of them lived in Ruthenia and Subcarpathia, areas previously ceded to Hungary; most of whom led good lives despite the presence of antisemitism among the peasant population of Slovakia. [369] As early as April 1939, anti-Jewish legislation was enacted, but this was religious and not racial in nomenclature. Nonetheless, the restrictions against Jews proceeded accordingly, blocking them from various professions, which was accompanied by violence against the Jews from the indigenous Hlinka Guard.[370] Slovakian Jews were among the first to be handed over en masse to the Nazis following the Wannsee Conference.[371] Members of the Hlinka Guard went house to house and brutally seized young and fit Jews from their homes in March and April 1942, sending them to Auschwitz as slave laborers. [372] The Hlinka Guard was assisted by the Freiwillige Schutzstaffel (Slovak volunteers in the SS). [370] Between March through October 1942, Tiso's Slovakian regime deported approximately 58,000 Jews to the German-occupied part of Poland. [370] The Slovak government even paid the Germans for the Jews that were deported. [373] The deportation of the remaining 24,000 was stopped due to the intervention of a Papal nuncio, whereby the Slovak president was informed that the German authorities were killing the Jews deported from Slovakia. Despite this action, approximately 12,600 Slovak Jews were still sent to Auschwitz, Theresienstadt, and other camps in Germany before the deportations ceased. Around half of them were killed in concentration camps. [374] Aggregate numbers of Holocaust victims tabulated by experts indicate that at least 60,000 Jews as well as 400 Slovakian Gypsies were killed; high estimates place the total number of Jewish victims from Slovakia at 71,000 persons. [375] Soviet Union[edit] Main articles: Holocaust in Russia, Holocaust in Ukraine, and Holocaust in Belarus As early as 1903, Vladimir Lenin had already formulated a Communist ideology about the Jews, who he avowed, were not a nation since they did not possess any specified territory; this position was shared by Stalin and in the 1920s as many as 830,000 Soviet Jews were considered lishentsy (non-citizens). [376] Some of those Jewish non-citizens eventually applied to work in factories and subsequently gained their citizenship but Jewish culture and literature faded fast under the Stalinist government. [377] Nearly 90 percent of Russian Jews were urbanized and lived in one of eleven cities, with the largest groups in Moscow, Kiev, Odessa, and Leningrad. [378] Antisemitic literature like the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion —which purports to describe a Jewish conspiracy for world domination—was popular in prewar Russia. [379] Russian pogroms targeting the Jews were among the first in the modern period to incite its citizens to violence for the sake of political expediency. [380] Still, around three million Jews lived across the vast expanse of the Soviet Union in January 1939. [381] The Jewish population within the Soviet territories was distributed as follows: 300,000 in Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, 5,000 in Estonia, 95,000 in Latvia, 155,000 in Lithuania (excluding Vilna), 1.5 to 1.6 million in Soviet-occupied Poland, and another 3.1 million in the USSR. [382] During the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Jews were unaware of the Nazi anti-Jewish policies, partly as a result of Soviet silence about the matter. [383] In the German-occupied Soviet territories, local Nazi collaborationist units represented over 80% of the available German forces, which provided them with a total of nearly 450,000 personnel organised in so-called Schutzmannschaften formations. Practically all of these units participated in the round-ups and mass shootings. The overwhelming majority were recruited in the western USSR and the Baltic region, areas recently occupied by the Soviets where the Jews were typically scapegoated, which exacerbated pre-Nazi antisemitic attitudes. [384] Ukrainians in particular, displayed some of the most virulent hatred of the Jews and approved of German measures against them, despite their initial constraint in persecuting them. [385] Eventually some 12,000 Ukrainian auxiliaries joined the Nazis in perpetuating the Final Solution and while many of them participated as Ukrainian nationalists, antisemitism proved a factor, one which they acquired on the job. [386] Thousands of Ukrainians rushed to occupy businesses and homes vacated by persecuted Jews. [387] German Einsatzgruppen units, members of the Wehrmacht, Order Police, and auxiliary units mostly from Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine were already engaged in killing operations in the summer of 1941 and by July of that year, they had helped kill 39,000 Ukrainian Jews, and another 26,000 Jews in Belarus. [388] Local citizens aided by militias in Latvia, Bukovina, Romania, Bessarabia, Moldavia, Lithuania, Bialystok, Galicia, and elsewhere killed tens-of-thousands of Jews on their own accord. [389] Throughout the remainder of 1941 to the autumn of 1942, the concerted murder operations proceeded apace. [390] Not accounting for the deaths of victims from its territories, at least 700,000 Soviet Jews and 30,000 Gypsies were killed in the Holocaust. [391] Another three-million Soviet soldiers were killed or starved-to-death by the Germans. [392] Spain[edit] Franco and Hitler in Meeting at Hendaye, 1940 During World War II, Francisco Franco remained largely silent in regard to Jewish matters, and Spain became an unlikely escape route and haven for thousands of Jews. Franco was known to harbor virulent antisemitic beliefs and agreed with Hitler that Judaism, Communism, and cosmopolitanism were related threats to European society. [393] Western European Jews still fled to Spain, as they sought to escape deportation to concentration camps from German-occupied France, but also Sephardic Jews from Eastern Europe, especially in Hungary. Trudy Alexy refers to the \"absurdity\" and \"paradox of refugees fleeing the Nazis' Final Solution to seek asylum in a country where no Jews had been allowed to live openly as Jews for over four centuries.\" [394] In the first years of the war, \"Laws regulating their admittance were written and mostly ignored.\" [395] Once the tide of war began to turn against the Germans, and Count Francisco Gómez-Jordana succeeded Franco's brother-in-law Serrano Súñer as Spain's foreign minister, Spanish diplomacy became \"more sympathetic to Jews\", although Franco himself \"never said anything\" about it. [395] Around that same time, a contingent of Spanish doctors traveling in Poland were fully informed of the Nazi extermination plans by the Gauleiter Frankel of Warsaw, who was under the misimpression that they would share his views about the matter; when they returned home, they passed the information to Admiral Luís Carrero Blanco, who told Franco. [396] Allied diplomats discussed the possibility of Spain as a route to a containment camp for Jewish refugees near Casablanca, but it came to nothing due to a lack of support. [397] Nonetheless, control of the Spanish border with France relaxed somewhat [398] and thousands of Jews managed to cross into Spain (many by smugglers' routes). Almost all of them survived the war. [399] The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee operated openly in Barcelona. [400] [z] Francoist Spain, despite its aversion to Zionism and \"Judeo\"- Freemasonry, does not appear to have shared the rabid antisemitic ideology promoted by the Nazis. [402] About 20,000 to 30,000 refugees, mainly Jews, were allowed to transit through Spain to Portugal and beyond. [403] About 5,000 Jews in occupied Europe benefitted from Spanish legal protection. [404] [aa] In 2010, a document was found in Spanish archives, which revealed that Franco's government gave a main architect of the Nazi \"Final Solution \", Heinrich Himmler, a list of six thousand Jews living in Spain, upon his request. Jose Maria Finat y Escriva de Romani, Franco's chief of security issued an official order dated 13 May 1941 to all provincial governors requesting a list of all Jews, both local and foreign, present in their districts. After the list was compiled, Romani was appointed Spain's ambassador to Germany, enabling him to deliver the list to Himmler. Following the defeat of Germany in 1945, the Spanish government attempted to destroy all evidence of cooperation with the Nazis, but this official order survived. Spanish diplomats did save thousands of Jews, but it was done on their personal initiative. [405] Sweden[edit] See also: History of the Jews in Sweden Before the onset of the Second World War, approximately 7,000 Jews resided in Sweden, most of whom lived in Stockholm. [406] Like Switzerland, the Swedish government remained neutral due to its financial ties and the economic advantages it secured from a friendly relationship with Germany. [407] There was even a small fascist pro-Nazi political group—known as the Swedish National Socialist Party—but they were unable to rally support for their cause. [408] Swedish authorities were initially resistant to Jewish immigration into the country and several thousand were turned away. [409] That was not to last, as by 1942 the Swedish government started allowing Norwegian and Finnish immigrants, as well as taking in some 900 Norwegian Jews. [410] Another 7,000 Danish Jews and some 9,000 Danish Christians were permitted entrance to Sweden in 1943. In 1944, the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg traveled to Budapest and negotiated for the release of thousands of Hungarian Jews. [411] Wallenberg's efforts secured passports for 15,000–20,000 Jews; he and those collaborating with him very likely saved the lives of some 70,000 Jews before the Red Army's arrival in Hungary during January 1945. [412] Switzerland[edit] See also: World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks Proximity to Nazi Germany as a bordering nation made the Swiss government very tentative about dealing with the Jews. [413] Sharing a physical border with Germany was also part of the reason that the Swiss maintained amicable economic relations with Germany. [414] Correspondingly, both Sweden and especially Switzerland cooperated with the Nazis concerning banking and the exploitation of financial opportunities, as they knowingly accepted expropriation of money and goods, which previously belonged to Jewish companies and/or families for their own gain. [415] Before 1938, Swiss alien and refugee policy was already restrictive toward certain people and groups, notably foreign Roma and Sinti. However, from that date, restrictions were intensified, particularly towards Jews. As part of that policy, the Swiss government requested that the German government mark the passports of German Jews with a \"J\" as they were not ready to grant asylum on the grounds of racial persecution. [416] [417] This policy took effect following the Anschluß with Austria, as the Swiss government was concerned about potential Jewish refugees fleeing and inundating them accordingly. [418] In 1942 Swiss borders were completely closed to all Jewish refugees, which even included Jewish children. [419] By late October 1942, news of the Jewish catastrophe had reached Switzerland. [419] After German troops seized control of Italy, which had withdrawn its political and military support when non-fascist Italians overthrew Mussolini, hundreds of Jews escaped over the mountain passes into neutral Switzerland. [420] French resistance fighters and activists were also instrumental in helping smuggle Jews from France into neutral Spain and Switzerland, where they were able to find shelter. [421] Sometime in 1944, some 1,684 Hungarian Jews arrived in Switzerland from Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, another 1,200 Jews from Theresienstadt concentration camp found safety in Switzerland and by February 1945, over 115,000 refugees of various types had made their way across the Swiss border to safety. [422] The International Commission of Experts (ICE) set up in 1996 by the Swiss parliament to examine relations between Nazi Germany and Switzerland reported: \"Anti-Semitic views were more or less widespread amongst the political classes, the civil service, the military and the church.\" [423] The ICE wrote: \"by progressively closing the borders, delivering captured refugees over to their persecutors, and adhering to restrictive principles for far too long, the country stood by as many people were undoubtedly driven to certain death.\" [424] Although accurate statistics are hard to put together, the commission concluded that \"It must therefore be assumed that Switzerland turned back or deported over 20,000 refugees during the Second World War. Furthermore, between 1938 and November 1944, around 14,500 applications for entry visas submitted by hopeful emigrants to the Swiss diplomatic missions abroad were refused.\" [425] [ab] United States[edit] According to The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, the U.S. failed to live up to its creed about accepting the \"tired, poor, huddled masses\" of the world during the Holocaust. [426] The U.S. policy towards Jews fleeing Germany and claiming asylum was restrictive. In 1939, the annual combined German-Austrian immigration quota was 27,370. [427] A famous incident was the U.S. denial of entry to the St. Louis, a ship loaded with 937 passengers. Almost all passengers aboard the vessel were Jews fleeing from Nazi Germany. Most were German citizens, some were from Eastern Europe, and a few were officially \"stateless.\" The ship's original destination was Cuba, but the Cuban government, after admitting 28 refugees, ordered the ship to leave. The ship continued to the U.S., sailing so close to Florida that the passengers could see the lights of Miami. Some passengers on the St. Louis cabled President Franklin D. Roosevelt asking for refuge. Roosevelt never responded, though he could have issued an executive order to admit the St. Louis refugees. A State Department telegram sent to a passenger stated that the passengers must \"await their turns on the waiting list and qualify for and obtain immigration visas before they may be admissible into the United States.\" [427] Finally, the ship was forced to return to Europe and some 254 of its Jewish passengers eventually were murdered in the Holocaust. [427] On 17 December 1942, the United States finally issued a statement condemning the Nazi extermination program, but this turned out to be a meaningless gesture as did the follow-on Bermuda Conference of April 1943. [428] By that same year, evidence of the death camps was circulating via firsthand accounts through the State Department but U.S. leaders took no effort to bomb the camps nor did America offer to take in hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees. [429] According to historian Victor Davis Hanson, American officials like then Assistant Secretary of State Breckinridge Long and Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy were \"especially culpable\" for their roles in \"downplaying\" evidence of the camps and for \"incorrectly asserting that heavy bombers either could not reach camps like Auschwitz or could not be diverted from more important missions.\" [430] In the end, the United States did not lift its immigration restriction against Jewish refugees until after the Second World War was over. [431] [ac] Legal proceedings against Nazis[edit] Main article: Nuremberg Trials The juridical notion of crimes against humanity was developed following the Holocaust. The sheer number of people murdered and the transnational nature of the mass killing shattered any notion of national sovereignty taking precedence over international law when prosecuting these crimes. There were a number of legal efforts established to bring Nazis and their collaborators to justice. Some of the higher-ranking Nazi officials were tried as part of the Nuremberg Trials, presided over by an Allied court; the first international tribunal of its kind. Other trials were conducted in the countries in which the defendants were citizens — in West Germany and Austria, many Nazis were let off with light sentences, with the claim of \"following orders\" ruled a mitigating circumstance, and many returned to society soon afterward. [432] An ongoing effort to pursue Nazis and collaborators resulted, famously, in the 1960 capture of Holocaust organizer Adolf Eichmann in Argentina (an operation led by Rafi Eitan) and to his subsequent trial in Israel in 1961. [433] [434] Simon Wiesenthal became one of the most famous Nazi hunters. [435] Flight from justice and other obfuscations[edit] See also: U.S. intelligence involvement with German and Japanese war criminals after World War II and Ratlines (World War II aftermath) Aleksandras Lileikis was involved in the murder of 60,000 Jews in Lithuania. He later worked for the CIA. [ad] Some former Nazis escaped any charges. For example, Reinhard Gehlen, a former intelligence officer of the Wehrmacht, managed to turn around and work for the CIA, and created what informally became known as the Gehlen Organization. He recruited ex–intelligence-officers of the Wehrmacht and Nazis from the SS and SD to work for him. [436] On 1 April 1956, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND; the German intelligence agency) was created from the Gehlen Organization, and transferred to the West German government. Reinhard Gehlen became President of the BND and remained its head until 1968. [437] Klaus Barbie, known as \"the Butcher of Lyon\" for his role at the head of the Gestapo, was protected from 1945 to 1955 by MI5 and the CIA, before fleeing to South America where he had a hand in Luis García Meza Tejada 's 1980 Cocaine Coup in Bolivia. [438] Barbie was finally arrested in 1983 and sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity in 1987.

However, this argument, which insists on the industrialization and technical rationality through which the Holocaust itself was carried out (the organization of trains, technical details, etc.—see Adolf Eichmann 's bureaucratic work), was in turn opposed by other people. This argument is contrasted against the fact that the 1994 Rwandan genocide mostly used machetes. ^Not alone in the pursuit of eugenic endeavors, other national societies (especially the United States) were rife with racialist ideals. See for instance: Kühl, Stefan. The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism. New York: Oxford University Press, 2002. ^In his works on \"biopolitics\" and in his lecture course at the College de France entitled, Society Must Be defended, French critical theorist and philosopher Michel Foucault argued that the Holocaust was a product of the modern polity as a \"biological\" notion, where whole populations \"are at war with one another\" and most of the time this \"war\" involves clever manipulation of social phenomena such as mass persuasion and Propaganda. ^See: Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (10 December 1942), The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland. Note to the Governments of the United Nations. ^Also see: \"The Holocaust: World Response\" at the JewishVirtualLibrary.org ^Even so, special courts (Sondergerichte) killed 12,000 Germans for their opposition to the Nazi regime. [44] ^For discussion of the psychological war campaign concerning the idea of collective guilt, see: Denazification ^In the same entry, Kellner wrote that \"ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly.\" [58] ^Also see: Browning, Christopher R.

See: Fest, Joachim. Plotting Hitler's Death: The Story of the German Resistance. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1997. ^Alternate spelling, Ustaše ^Many Jews fled into neighboring regions while others were deported both during and after the Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. Croats who opposed the Nazi regime were imprisoned in concentration camps. Some Croats risked their lives during the Holocaust in order to save Jews from extermination by the Nazis. See for instance: Croatian Righteous Among the Nations ^Before the war's end, fifty-one amid the 400-plus Jews at Theresienstadt died at the camp. [198] ^According to historian Yehuda Bauer, the Vichy government was profoundly complicit in the Holocaust; he cites the example of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup of 16 and 17 July 1942, in which 12,884 Jewish men, women, and children were arrested, including some 4,000 small children who were previously roaming the streets of Paris. They were held at the Winter Velodrome and Drancy transit camp under harsh conditions, and nearly all were eventually transported by rail to Auschwitz.[229] ^Members of the EEE assisted the occupying forces in identifying Jews and collaborated on the deportation of local Jews with remarkable efficiency, either for ethnic hatred or for more prosaic reasons such as obtaining profits from the confiscation and sale of Jewish property. By the time of the German withdrawal from Greece in 1944, nearly 90% of the Jewish community in Thessaloniki had been annihilated. [233] ^According to a U.S. State Dept. report from 2012, there were only 26 Jews residing in Liechtenstein.[270] ^According to Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg—unlike Poland, where persecution of the Jews was openly carried out, the Nazis had to pay close attention to public opinion in the Netherlands. [299] ^The 80% figure is also substantiated in The Holocaust Encyclopedia, edited by Walter Laqueur and Judith T. Baumel. [304] ^Additional reasons that have been suggested to explain the high percentages of Jews murdered in the Netherlands range from: the occupation regime in the Netherlands was formed by fanatical Austrian Nazis; the typical Dutch landscape without mountains or woods made it practically impossible to find shelter; the majority of the Dutch Jews lived in the larger cities and thus they formed relatively easy targets for persecution and segregation; the Jewish leaders chose, \"in order to prevent worse\", a policy of collaboration with the Nazis. See: Ad van Liempt, A Price on Their Heads, Kopgeld, Dutch bounty hunters in search of Jews, 1943 ^Members of Codreanu's Iron Guard killed 120 Jews on 19–20 January 1941 and hung their bodies like cattle carcasses at a slaughterhouse in Bucharest. [346] ^See the official report here: https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/20080226-romania-commission-holocaust-history.pdf ^Also see: Golbert, Rebecca L. \"Holocaust Sites in Ukraine: Pechora and the Politics of Memorialization.\" Holocaust and Genocide Studies 18, no. 2 (2004): 205–233, ISSN 1476-7937 ^Retribution against the Jews was especially severe in Serbia, partly from the fact that the German forces encountered serious resistance there earlier than they had in the Soviet Union and took from the experience, lessons for future operations. [363] ^Shortly afterwards, Spain began giving citizenship to Sephardic Jews in Greece, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania; many Ashkenazic Jews also managed to be included, as did some non-Jews. The Spanish head of mission in Budapest, Ángel Sanz Briz, may have saved thousands of Ashkenazim in Hungary by granting them Spanish citizenship, placing them in safe houses, and teaching them minimal Spanish so they could pretend to be Sephardim, at least to someone who did not know Spanish. The Spanish diplomatic corps was performing a balancing act: Alexy conjectures that the number of Jews they took in was limited by how much German hostility they were willing to engender. [401] ^Some historians argue that these facts demonstrate the Franco regime's humane attitude, others point out that Spain only permitted transit and did not wish to increase its own small Jewish population. After the war, Franco's regime was quite hospitable to those who had been responsible for the deportation of the Jews, notably Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, Commissioner for Jewish Affairs (May 1942 – February 1944) under the Vichy Régime in France. See: Nicholas Fraser, \"Toujours Vichy: a reckoning with disgrace\", Harper's, October 2006, p. 86–94. ^The conclusions of the ICE report about refugees have been questioned, most notably by Jean-Christian Lambelet who criticises the statistical work and argues \"inter alia\" that there was a big gap between policy and actual practice. He believes that the figures of Jews that were sent back were overestimated.

Communities can share a sense of place in geographical areas or exist in virtual spaces through communication platforms [1]. The key elements that define a community include:\n\n### Essential Components\n- **Membership**: A feeling of belonging or sharing personal relatedness\n- **Influence**: Members matter to the group and the group matters to its members  \n- **Reinforcement**: Integration and fulfillment of needs\n- **Shared emotional connection**: Common experiences and bonds [1]\n\n## Community Definitions Across Different Contexts\n\n### Sociological Perspective\nFrom a sociological standpoint, communities are characterized by \"durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties\" and are \"important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at large\" [1].\n\n### Ecological Context  \nIn ecology, a community represents \"an assemblage of populations - potentially of different species - interacting with one another\" [1]. This biological definition emphasizes the interconnectedness and mutual dependence of different groups within a shared environment.\n\n### Archaeological Framework\nArchaeologists use two approaches to define community:\n1. **Spatial definition**: Places where people used to live (settlements, villages, cities)\n2. **Social definition**: Groups of people living near one another who interact socially [1]\n\n## Types of Communities\n\nCommunities can be categorized in several ways [1]:\n\n### By Location\n- **Location-based Communities**: Neighborhoods, suburbs, villages, towns, cities, regions, nations\n- Also called \"communities of place\"\n\n### By Identity  \n- **Identity-based Communities**: Local cliques, subcultures, ethnic groups, religious groups, multicultural civilizations\n- May include communities of need (disabled persons, elderly)\n\n### By Organization\n- **Organizationally-based Communities**: Family networks, guilds, associations, political structures, economic enterprises, professional associations\n\n## What Makes a \"Civilized Community\"\n\nA **civilized society** represents \"a well developed system of government, culture, and way of life that treats the people who live there fairly\" [5]. Key characteristics include:\n\n### Foundational Elements\n- **Effective governance**: Strong government systems (whether monarchy, democracy, or other forms) that enforce laws and provide safety [6]\n- **Education and literacy**: Investment in learning and knowledge development [6]\n- **Cultural development**: Art, science, and entertainment that build cultural cohesion [6]\n- **Social stratification**: Organized class systems with defined roles [5]\n- **Rule of law**: Fair justice systems and accountability mechanisms [5]\n\n### Advanced Characteristics\n- **Infrastructure**: Public works like roads, utilities, and transportation systems [6]\n- **Economic specialization**: Division of labor allowing people to focus on specific skills [6] \n- **Technology and innovation**: Scientific advancement that improves quality of life [6]\n- **Strong middle class**: Economic stability and opportunity [6]\n\n## Grassroots Organizations and Movements\n\n### Definition and Characteristics\n**Grassroots movements** use \"the people in a given district, region or community as the basis for a political or economic movement\" [3]. They are characterized by:\n\n- **Bottom-up decision making**: Rather than top-down control [3]\n- **Local participation**: Focus on engaging ordinary people in political discourse [3]\n- **Community-based approaches**: Created to address localized problems [2]\n- **Collective action**: From local level to effect change at multiple scales [3]\n\n### Grassroots Strategies\nEffective grassroots organizations employ various tactics [3]:\n- Hosting community meetings and parties\n- Door-to-door outreach and street conversations\n- Petition gathering and signature campaigns  \n- Letter-writing and phone campaigns\n- Organizing demonstrations and rallies\n- Fundraising from small donors\n- Social media mobilization using hashtags\n\n### Historical Examples\n- **American Civil Rights Movement** (1950s-1960s): Local-level organizing for racial integration [3]\n- **Brazilian Landless Workers Movement** (1970s): Farmers organizing for land access rights [3]\n- **German Peace Movement** (1980s): Citizens organizing against nuclear armament [3]\n\n## How Communities Set Boundaries and Priorities\n\n### Decision-Making Processes\nCommunities establish boundaries and priorities through various mechanisms:\n\n#### Formal Governance Structures\n- **Administrative systems**: Made up of community members with authority to tax, fine, and propose initiatives [4]\n- **Rules and laws**: Set boundaries and communicate acceptable behavior [4]\n- **Enforcement institutions**: Police, courts, and other accountability systems [4]\n\n#### Community Participation Models\nResearch on community participation identifies different levels of engagement [8]:\n- **Information sharing**: Basic communication about decisions\n- **Consultation**: Seeking input from community members\n- **Partnership**: Shared decision-making authority\n- **Citizen control**: Community-led governance\n\n### Priority Setting Factors\nCommunities typically prioritize based on:\n- **Shared values and understandings**: Common approaches to social interaction [4]\n- **Resource availability**: What the community can collectively support [4]\n- **Safety and security needs**: Protection from internal and external threats [4]\n- **Economic considerations**: Pooling resources for mutual benefit [4]\n\n## Community Roles in Preparedness and Nation-Building\n\n### Disaster Preparedness and Response\nCommunities play crucial roles in disaster management through:\n\n#### Japanese Model of Community Resilience\nJapan exemplifies effective community-based disaster preparedness through three key concepts [9]:\n- **\"Jijo\" (Individual Self-Reliance)**: Personal and household preparedness\n- **\"Kyojo\" (Community Self-Reliance)**: Neighborhood-level cooperation and planning  \n- **\"Kojo\" (Government Assistance)**: Official support and coordination\n\n#### Community Structures for Disaster Management\n- **Jiishu-bosai-soshiki**: Self-support disaster reduction associations [9]\n- **\"Machizukuri\"**: Citizen-led community development and town creation [9]\n- Local emergency planning and resource coordination\n\n### Nation-Building Contributions\nCommunities contribute to broader national development through:\n\n#### Civic Engagement\n- **Political participation**: Voting, advocacy, and public dialogue [8]\n- **Social capital development**: Building trust and cooperation networks\n- **Cultural preservation**: Maintaining traditions and shared identity\n\n#### Economic Development  \n- **Local entrepreneurship**: Small businesses and economic innovation\n- **Resource mobilization**: Pooling community assets for development projects\n- **Skills development**: Training and education programs\n\n#### Social Cohesion\n- **Integration support**: Helping newcomers adapt to community norms [1]\n- **Conflict resolution**: Managing disputes and maintaining harmony\n- **Mutual aid**: Supporting vulnerable community members\n\n## Modern Challenges and Adaptations\n\n### Virtual Communities\nThe digital age has expanded community concepts to include online spaces where people \"value knowledge and information as currency or social resource\" [1]. These virtual communities:\n- Focus on information exchange about specific topics\n- Rely on \"weak ties\" between acquaintances and strangers  \n- Can interact with offline activities to form strong networks\n\n### Balancing Individual and Collective Needs\nModern communities face the challenge of \"how to incorporate individuality and differences\" while maintaining shared identity and purpose [1]. This requires ongoing negotiation between personal freedom and collective responsibility.\n\nCommunities represent complex, multi-layered social structures that serve essential functions in human society - from providing basic security and identity to enabling large-scale cooperation for disaster response and nation-building. Understanding their various forms and functions helps us appreciate how communities adapt to meet changing needs while maintaining their core purpose of bringing people together for mutual benefit.", "citations": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community\n", "https://diversity.social/grassroots/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots\n", "https://study.com/academy/lesson/communities-definition-motivations-characteristics.html", "https://treehozz.com/what-is-the-definition-of-civilized-society\n", "https://www.reference.com/world-view/characteristics-civilized-society-5efdd6d1d0bbc9f3", "https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756384/obo-9780199756384-0080.xml\n", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305720706_Community_Participation_in_Nation_Building_Lessons_from_the_US_Experience", "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10726-012-9320-8", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351395681_Disaster_Risk_Reduction_Towards_Community_Resilience_Empirical_Model_of_Decision-Making_Process_Through_Stop_Disaster_Game", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277681170_Decision-Making_Policy_Choices_and_Community_Rebuilding_after_the_Tohoku_Disaster"], "contexts": ["Community - Wikipedia\nCommunity\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nFor the TV series, see Community (TV series).

Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms. Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at large. [1] Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, \"community\" may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.[2]\nThe English-language word \"community\" derives from the Old French comuneté (currently \"Communauté\"), which comes from the Latin communitas \"community\", \"public spirit\" (from Latin communis, \"common\"). [3]\nHuman communities may have intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, and risks in common, affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.

The first is an informal definition of community as a place where people used to live. In this sense it is synonymous with the concept of an ancient settlement - whether a hamlet, village, town, or city. The second meaning resembles the usage of the term in other social sciences: a community is a group of people living near one another who interact socially. Social interaction on a small scale can be difficult to identify with archaeological data. Most reconstructions of social communities by archaeologists rely on the principle that social interaction in the past was conditioned by physical distance. Therefore, a small village settlement likely constituted a social community and spatial subdivisions of cities and other large settlements may have formed communities. Archaeologists typically use similarities in material culture —from house types to styles of pottery—to reconstruct communities in the past. This classification method relies on the assumption that people or households will share more similarities in the types and styles of their material goods with other members of a social community than they will with outsiders. [5]\nSociology[edit]\nThis section is empty. You can help by adding to it. (January 2022)\nEcology[edit]\nMain article: Community (ecology)\nIn ecology, a community is an assemblage of populations - potentially of different species - interacting with one another. Community ecology is the branch of ecology that studies interactions between and among species. It considers how such interactions, along with interactions between species and the abiotic environment, affect social structure and species richness, diversity and patterns of abundance. Species interact in three ways: competition, predation and mutualism :\nCompetition typically results in a double negative—that is both species lose in the interaction.\nPredation involves a win/lose situation, with one species winning.\nMutualism sees both species co-operating in some way, with both winning.\nThe two main types of ecological communities are major communities, which are self-sustaining and self-regulating (such as a forest or a lake), and minor communities, which rely on other communities (like fungi decomposing a log) and are the building blocks of major communities.\nA simplified example of a community. A community includes many populations and how they interact with each other. This example shows interaction between the zebra and the bush, and between the lion and the zebra, as well as between the bird and the organisms by the water, like the worms.\nSemantics[edit]\nThe concept of \"community\" often has a positive semantic connotation, exploited rhetorically by populist politicians and by advertisers [6] to promote feelings and associations of mutual well-being, happiness and togetherness [7] - veering towards an almost-achievable utopian community, in fact.\nIn contrast, the epidemiological term \"community transmission\" can have negative implications; [8] and instead of a \"criminal community\" [9] one often speaks of a \"criminal underworld\" or of the \"criminal fraternity\".\nKey concepts[edit]\nGemeinschaft and Gesellschaft[edit]\nMain article: Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft\nIn Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (1887), German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies described two types of human association: Gemeinschaft (usually translated as \"community\") and Gesellschaft (\"society\" or \"association\"). Tönnies proposed the Gemeinschaft–Gesellschaft dichotomy as a way to think about social ties. No group is exclusively one or the other. Gemeinschaft stress personal social interactions, and the roles, values, and beliefs based on such interactions. Gesellschaft stress indirect interactions, impersonal roles, formal values, and beliefs based on such interactions. [10]\nSense of community[edit]\nMain article: Sense of community\nIn a seminal 1986 study, McMillan and Chavis [11] identify four elements of \"sense of community\":\nmembership: feeling of belonging or of sharing a sense of personal relatedness,\ninfluence: mattering, making a difference to a group and of the group mattering to its members\nreinforcement: integration and fulfillment of needs,\nshared emotional connection.\nTo what extent do participants in joint activities experience a sense of community?\nA \"sense of community index\" (SCI) was developed by Chavis and colleagues, and revised and adapted by others. Although originally designed to assess sense of community in neighborhoods, the index has been adapted for use in schools, the workplace, and a variety of types of communities. [12]\nStudies conducted by the APPA[who?] indicate that young adults who feel a sense of belonging in a community, particularly small communities, develop fewer psychiatric and depressive disorders than those who do not have the feeling of love and belonging.[citation needed]\nSocialization[edit]\nMain article: Socialization\nLewes Bonfire Night procession commemorating 17 Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake from 1555 to 1557\nThe process of learning to adopt the behavior patterns of the community is called socialization. The most fertile time of socialization is usually the early stages of life, during which individuals develop the skills and knowledge and learn the roles necessary to function within their culture and social environment.[13] For some psychologists, especially those in the psychodynamic tradition, the most important period of socialization is between the ages of one and ten. But socialization also includes adults moving into a significantly different environment where they must learn a new set of behaviors. [14]\nSocialization is influenced primarily by the family, through which children first learn community norms. Other important influences include schools, peer groups, people, mass media, the workplace, and government. The degree to which the norms of a particular society or community are adopted determines one's willingness to engage with others. The norms of tolerance, reciprocity, and trust are important \"habits of the heart,\" as de Tocqueville put it, in an individual's involvement in community. [15]\nCommunity development[edit]\nMain article: Community development\nCommunity development is often linked with community work or community planning, and may involve stakeholders, foundations, governments, or contracted entities including non-government organisations (NGOs), universities or government agencies to progress the social well-being of local, regional and, sometimes, national communities. More grassroots efforts, called community building or community organizing, seek to empower individuals and groups of people by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities. [16] These skills often assist in building political power through the formation of large social groups working for a common agenda. Community development practitioners must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities' positions within the context of larger social institutions. Public administrators, in contrast, need to understand community development in the context of rural and urban development, housing and economic development, and community, organizational and business development.\nFormal accredited programs conducted by universities, as part of degree granting institutions, are often used to build a knowledge base to drive curricula in public administration, sociology and community studies. The General Social Survey from the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and the Saguaro Seminar at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University are examples of national community development in the United States. The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in New York State offers core courses in community and economic development, and in areas ranging from non-profit development to US budgeting (federal to local, community funds). In the United Kingdom, the University of Oxford has led in providing extensive research in the field through its Community Development Journal, [17] used worldwide by sociologists and community development practitioners.\nAt the intersection between community development and community building are a number of programs and organizations with community development tools. One example of this is the program of the Asset Based Community Development Institute of Northwestern University. The institute makes available downloadable tools [18] to assess community assets and make connections between non-profit groups and other organizations that can help in community building. The Institute focuses on helping communities develop by \"mobilizing neighborhood assets\" – building from the inside out rather than the outside in. [19] In the disability field, community building was prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s with roots in John McKnight's approaches. [20] [21]\nCommunity building and organizing[edit]\nThe anti-war affinity group \"Collateral Damage\" protesting the Iraq War\nIn The Different Drum: Community-Making and Peace (1987) Scott Peck argues that the almost accidental sense of community that exists at times of crisis can be consciously built. Peck believes that conscious community building is a process of deliberate design based on the knowledge and application of certain rules. [22] He states that this process goes through four stages: [23]\nPseudocommunity: When people first come together, they try to be \"nice\" and present what they feel are their most personable and friendly characteristics.\nChaos: People move beyond the inauthenticity of pseudo-community and feel safe enough to present their \"shadow\" selves.\nEmptiness: Moves beyond the attempts to fix, heal and convert of the chaos stage, when all people become capable of acknowledging their own woundedness and brokenness, common to human beings.\nTrue community: Deep respect and true listening for the needs of the other people in this community.\nIn 1991, Peck remarked that building a sense of community is easy but maintaining this sense of community is difficult in the modern world. [24][further explanation needed]\nThe three basic types of community organizing are grassroots organizing, coalition building, and \"institution-based community organizing,\" (also called \"broad-based community organizing,\" an example of which is faith-based community organizing, or Congregation-based Community Organizing ). [25]\nCommunity building can use a wide variety of practices, ranging from simple events (e.g., potlucks, small book clubs) to larger-scale efforts (e.g., mass festivals, construction projects that involve local participants rather than outside contractors).\nCommunity building that is geared toward citizen action is usually termed \"community organizing.\" [26] In these cases, organized community groups seek accountability from elected officials and increased direct representation within decision-making bodies. Where good-faith negotiations fail, these constituency-led organizations seek to pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means, including picketing, boycotting, sit-ins, petitioning, and electoral politics.\nCommunity organizing can focus on more than just resolving specific issues. Organizing often means building a widely accessible power structure, often with the end goal of distributing power equally throughout the community. Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are open and democratic in governance. Such groups facilitate and encourage consensus decision-making with a focus on the general health of the community rather than a specific interest group.\nIf communities are developed based on something they share in common, whether location or values, then one challenge for developing communities is how to incorporate individuality and differences. Rebekah Nathan suggests[according to whom?] in her book, My Freshman Year, we are drawn to developing communities totally based on sameness, despite stated commitments to diversity, such as those found on university websites.\nTypes of community[edit]\nParticipants in Diana Leafe Christian's \"Heart of a Healthy Community\" seminar circle during an afternoon session at O.U.R. Ecovillage\nA number of ways to categorize types of community have been proposed. One such breakdown is as follows:\nLocation-based Communities: range from the local neighbourhood, suburb, village, town or city, region, nation or even the planet as a whole. These are also called communities of place.\nIdentity-based Communities: range from the local clique, sub-culture, ethnic group, religious, multicultural or pluralistic civilisation, or the global community cultures of today. They may be included as communities of need or identity, such as disabled persons, or frail aged people.\nOrganizationally-based Communities: range from communities organized informally around family or network -based guilds and associations to more formal incorporated associations, political decision making structures, economic enterprises, or professional associations at a small, national or international scale.\nThe usual categorizations of community relations have a number of problems: [27] (1) they tend to give the impression that a particular community can be defined as just this kind or another; (2) they tend to conflate modern and customary community relations; (3) they tend to take sociological categories such as ethnicity or race as given, forgetting that different ethnically defined persons live in different kinds of communities —grounded, interest-based, diasporic, etc. [28]\nIn response to these problems, Paul James and his colleagues have developed a taxonomy that maps community relations, and recognizes that actual communities can be characterized by different kinds of relations at the same time: [29]\nGrounded community relations. This involves enduring attachment to particular places and particular people. It is the dominant form taken by customary and tribal communities. In these kinds of communities, the land is fundamental to identity.\nLife-style community relations. This involves giving primacy to communities coming together around particular chosen ways of life, such as morally charged or interest-based relations or just living or working in the same location. Hence the following sub-forms:\ncommunity-life as morally bounded, a form taken by many traditional faith-based communities.\ncommunity-life as interest-based, including sporting, leisure-based and business communities which come together for regular moments of engagement.\ncommunity-life as proximately-related, where neighbourhood or commonality of association forms a community of convenience, or a community of place (see below).\nProjected community relations. This is where a community is self-consciously treated as an entity to be projected and re-created. It can be projected as through thin advertising slogan, for example gated community, or can take the form of ongoing associations of people who seek political integration, communities of practice [30] based on professional projects, associative communities which seek to enhance and support individual creativity, autonomy and mutuality. A nation is one of the largest forms of projected or imagined community.\nIn these terms, communities can be nested and/or intersecting; one community can contain another—for example a location-based community may contain a number of ethnic communities. [31] Both lists above can used in a cross-cutting matrix in relation to each other.\nInternet communities[edit]\nMain article: Virtual community\nIn general, virtual communities value knowledge and information as currency or social resource. [32] [33] [34] [35] What differentiates virtual communities from their physical counterparts is the extent and impact of \"weak ties\", which are the relationships acquaintances or strangers form to acquire information through online networks. [36] Relationships among members in a virtual community tend to focus on information exchange about specific topics. [37] [38] A survey conducted by Pew Internet and The American Life Project in 2001 found those involved in entertainment, professional, and sports virtual-groups focused their activities on obtaining information. [39]\nAn epidemic of bullying and harassment has arisen from the exchange of information between strangers, especially among teenagers, [40] in virtual communities. Despite attempts to implement anti-bullying policies, Sheri Bauman, professor of counselling at the University of Arizona, claims the \"most effective strategies to prevent bullying\" may cost companies revenue. [41]\nVirtual Internet-mediated communities can interact with offline real-life activity, potentially forming strong and tight-knit groups such as QAnon.[42]\nSee also[edit]\nCircles of Sustainability\nCommunitarianism\nCommunity theatre\nEngaged theory\nOutline of community\nWikipedia community\nNotes[edit]\n^James, Paul; Nadarajah, Yaso; Haive, Karen; Stead, Victoria (2012).

Community is a very troublesome word then, having a wide range of meanings and connotations but little in the way of specific content. It is particularly useful as a rhetorical device because of its democratic and populist connotations, being associated with 'the people', as distinct from 'the government'.\n^For example: Basu, Mohana (13 March 2020). \"What is community transmission — how one can contract COVID-19 without travelling\".

It means the most basic or fundamental level of activity in operation or organization. Or, at the roots of the grass. When an organization or community is looking to make a change from the ground up, they will start at the grassroots. In simpler terms, grassroots is the place where things begin and grow.\nHowever, in a modern context, the word is often used to drive an ideology or political movement.\nSince the early 1900s, mass grassroots movements have been prevalent in both the United States and other countries worldwide. Some of the significant examples of grassroots campaigns include some aspects of the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s – 1960s, Brazil’s land ownership revolution in the 1970s.\nIn the 1980s, the Chinese rural democracy movement and the German peace lobby. These movements were primarily politically driven, where the organic association of people was the basis for supporting the issue/ideology or candidate.\nGrassroots organizing and campaigning must be community-based, very\ninclusive and definitely broad. Grassroots includes the everyday ordinary working people, who constitute a significant part of the organization. Moreover, it is also how companies function smoothly in the first place.\nGrassroots Movement\nGrassroots movement relies on the collective action of the people supporting the cause. The movement employs different types of strategies to achieve its objectives. Many of these movements share a focus on increasing participation by the community or people most affected by the very issue the movements stand up for. In politics, a “grassroots movement” is a movement that develops organically at a local level before spreading throughout the state and even the country.\nOften, grassroots movements tackle social injustice, environmental issues, human rights violations, poverty, and economic inequality. When executed correctly and effectively, these movements can offer a wide range of creative and inspiring approaches for ordinary people to get involved in the change they want to see.\nFurthermore, grassroots movements often function as a powerful conversation platform where ordinary people come to terms with their ability to ignite change and make a difference.\nA true “grassroots movement” isn’t organized by political forces – instead, a “grassroots movement” springs up spontaneously due to some pressing issue that a community feels needs to be changed or enhanced. Education is the backbone of any grassroots campaign as people cannot participate in something that they do not understand. It is important therefore to raise awareness of an issue and to communicate effectively why it is such a concern. A higher level of visibility garners more support, and information is power for followers who want to be able to advocate for themselves, increasing the collective impact of the group.\nGrassroots movements and organizations use collective action from the local level to effect change at the local, regional, national, or international level. Grassroots movements are associated with bottom-up, rather than top-down decision making, and are sometimes considered more natural or spontaneous than more traditional power structures\nGrassroots Organizations\nIn recent years, there is a significant rise in grassroots organizations worldwide. Not only they’re gaining more massive support from civilians or the ordinary people, but many large bodies such as the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) are also recognizing and supporting their causes.\nIn January 2019, UNCHR published an article on how grassroots organizations are just as important as seed money for innovation. Stated was how these organizations have that much significance to affect change. The bottom-up approaches employed by grassroots organizations are more relevant.\nIt allows more common people who come from various walks of life and backgrounds to identify with the cause. At the same time, define their own goals and decide how to achieve them because the cause has personal and community consequences for them.\nGrassroots organizations have spread like wildfire that it no longer limits itself to the country where it is started. People worldwide can rally behind these organizations and support the cause because they believe in it.\nHowever, it’s important to note the difference between grassroots organizations and other advocacy capacities. Grassroots organization uses the process of shoring up power through the support of the people by first identifying the issue that these people share. Subsequently, it  identifies individuality within to lead solutions. On the other hand, advocacy uses multiple forms of advocacy. Where communicating with governmental representatives is one. This is to influence the opinion of the public and ultimately aims to influence the decisions within social, political, and economic institutions.\nGrassroots organizations are primarily made up of civilians advocating a cause to spur change at local, national, or international levels. Grassroots initiatives are community-based approaches created to address localized problems. Projects backed by local organizations can quickly gain momentum on the local level because they are generally enacted by local actors. Moreover, larger organizations could benefit from local grassroots initiatives that are directly connected to the issues and the people living in need.\nGrassroots Examples\nOne non-profit grassroots organization that is well-known among musicians is the Axis of Justice. Co-founded by musicians, singers, and songwriters Tom Morello, who is well-known for his role as the lead guitarist of the rock band Rage Against the Machine, and Serj Tankian, best known as the lead vocalist and primary lyricist for the heavy metal band System of a Down.\nThe organization was formed after Morello witnessed some audience members promoted racist symbols and imagery at the 2002 Ozzfest concert. They were adamant about eradicating racism and fascism in the music industry. In their efforts to do so, Axis of Justice found an ally in Anti-Racist Action shortly after it was formed.\nThis organization’s objective is to bring musicians and music fans together in their fight for social justice. The Axis of Justice aims to bridge the music industry and its fans from around the world and interested political organizations to organize measures that will and can help issues of peace, human rights, and economic justice. They are committed to affecting change, mainly through music’s power, by bringing to attention any social injustice, freedom violations, and education inequality.\nThe Axis of Justice\nThe AoJ is a not-for-profit group co-founded by Tom Morello and Serj Tankian. It is intended to connect musicians, music fans, and progressive grassroots ideals to promote social justice.\nAoJ tents have appeared at music festivals where either System of a Down or Audioslave were performing. Most famously, the group appeared at Lollapalooza in 2003. The Axis of Justice also produces a monthly radio program that can be heard on XM Satellite Radio and KPFK (90.7 FM), a Pacifica Radio station in Los Angeles, California. The AoJ radio broadcasts are archived as MP3s on the AoJ website, and are available to download for free.\nGrassroots Campaign\nGrassroots movements are built from the power of local and community involvement. Since they often started locally, these movements aim to raise money, awareness to their cause, build recognition, and, if possible, deepen political participation to make their objectives a reality.\nThe campaign strategies strongly focus on local involvement. Some of the ways a grassroots organization campaigns for their cause are hosting neighborhood meetings and distributing posters and pamphlets.\nThey also talk to and engage with the people on the street, go door-to-door, gather signatures for petitions, run fundraising events to raise money for advertising and promotion. They also organize peaceful rallies or public demonstrations and ask people to share their views and opinions on social media by using specific hashtags.\nGrassroots campaigns work entirely via narrow communication methods as email, phone calls, or the good-old face-to-face meetings. These do not consider broadcast media like television or radio. Ask your grassroots campaign donors to volunteer. A lot of times someone writes a check and is not asked to do anything else besides writing more checks. This is a mistake some of my best donors have become volunteers ( the reverse is also true) keep asking till folks say no.\nGrassroots activism\nIt’s not uncommon for grassroots movements to fail at gaining traction and momentum in furthering their cause. Unfortunately for many, belief is not strong enough to convince them to act.\nGrassroots activism focuses on ways to mobilize supporters and utilize the strength of their passion and conviction to move their cause forward. Grassroots activism largely depends on determined individuals within the movement who are willing to lead the change they want to see.\nGrassroots activism is about mobilizing a group of people, who are passionate about a cause and harnessing the power of their conviction to push for a different outcome.\nBecause the cause of grassroots movements is usually something very personal to these individuals, they often take the lead without much persuasion. It has the strength and power to move the community to take action.\nMany grassroots organizations are doing some serious changes in their community. They are seen as drawing-board allies for ideas and inspirations for community improvements and policy implementations.\nThe community should continue to support grassroots movements that have the power to make a difference. If they fail at their mission, they shouldn’t be subjected to shame because even if they failed, they tried to take actions where many probably wouldn’t.\nThe power of grassroots activism lies simply in the will and passion of the people who represent it. Personally motivated, the grassroots people bring an unrestrained enthusiasm that can carry a motion through the challenges that typically accompany change. This kind of movement relies on individuals who are willing to drive the change that they are concerned about from the ground-up. Often, the cause is something very personal and takes place in the activist’s own community.\nBest Grassroots Video\nhttps://youtu.be/9KMkBnK4jzE\nWhat is the Best Grassroots Definition?\nWhen an organization or community is looking to make a change from the ground up, they will start at the grassroots.

[1] Grassroots movements and organizations use collective action from the local level to effect change at the local, regional, national or international level. Grassroots movements are associated with bottom-up, rather than top-down decision making, and are sometimes considered more natural or spontaneous than more traditional power structures. [2]\nGrassroots movements, using self-organization, encourage community members to contribute by taking responsibility and action for their community. [3] Grassroots movements utilize a variety of strategies from fundraising and registering voters, to simply encouraging political conversation. Goals of specific movements vary and change, but the movements are consistent in their focus on increasing mass participation in politics. [4] These political movements may begin as small and at the local level, but grassroots politics as Cornel West contends are necessary in shaping progressive politics as they bring public attention to regional political concerns. [5]\nThe idea of grassroots is often conflated with participatory democracy. The Port Huron Statement, a manifesto seeking a more democratic society, says that to create a more equitable society, \"the grass roots of American Society\" need to be the basis of civil rights and economic reform movements. [6] The terms can be distinguished in that grassroots often refers to a specific movement or organization, whereas participatory democracy refers to the larger system of governance.

In the United States, an early use of the phrase \"grassroots and boots\" was thought to have been coined by Senator Albert Jeremiah Beveridge of Indiana, who said of the Progressive Party in 1912, \"This party has come from the grass roots. It has grown from the soil of people's hard necessities\". [8]\nIn a 1907 newspaper article about Ed Perry, vice-chairman of the Oklahoma state committee, the phrase was used as follows: \"In regard to his political views Mr. Perry has issued the following terse platform: 'I am for a square deal, grass root representation, for keeping close to the people, against ring rule and for fair treatment.'\" [9] A 1904 news article on a campaign for possible Theodore Roosevelt running mate Eli Torrance quotes a Kansas political organizer as saying: \"Roosevelt and Torrance clubs will be organized in every locality. We will begin at the grass roots\". [10]\nSince the early 1900s, grassroots movements have been widespread both in the United States and in other countries. Major examples include parts of the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil's land equity movement of the 1970s and beyond, the Chinese rural democracy movement of the 1980s and the German peace movement of the 1980s.\nA particular instantiation of grassroots politics in the American Civil Rights Movement was the 1951 case of William Van Til working on the integration of the Nashville Public Schools. Van Til worked to create a grassroots movement focused on discussing race relations at the local level. To that end, he founded the Nashville Community Relations Conference, which brought together leaders from various communities in Nashville to discuss the possibility of integration. In response to his attempts to network with leadership in the black community, residents of Nashville responded with violence and scare tactics. However, Van Til was still able to bring blacks and whites together to discuss the potential for changing race relations, and he was ultimately instrumental in integrating the Peabody College of Education in Nashville. Furthermore, the desegregation plan proposed by Van Til's Conference was implemented by Nashville schools in 1957. This movement is characterized as grassroots because it focused on changing a norm at the local level using local power. Van Til worked with local organizations to foster political dialogue and was ultimately successful.\nThe Brazilian Landless Workers Movement (MST) was founded in the 1970s and has grown into an international organization. The MST focused on organizing young farmers and their children in fighting for a variety of rights, most notably the right to access land. The movement sought organic leaders and used strategies of direct action such as land occupations. It largely maintained autonomy from the Brazilian government. The MST traces its roots to discontent arising from large land inequalities in Brazil in the 1960s. Such discontent gained traction, particularly after Brazil became a democracy in 1985. The movement focused especially on occupying land that was considered unproductive, thus showing that it was seeking overall social benefit. In the 1990s the influence of the MST grew tremendously following two mass killings of protestors. Successful protests were those in which the families of those occupying properties receiving plots of land. It is worth noting that although the grassroots efforts of the MST were successful in Brazil when they were tried by the South African Landless People's Movement (LPM) in 2001 they were not nearly as successful. Land occupations in South Africa were politically contentious and did not achieve the positive results seen by the MST. [11]\nThe National People's Congress was a grassroots democratic reform movement that came out of the existing Chinese government in 1987. It encouraged grassroots elections in villages all around China with the express purpose of bringing democracy to the local level of government. Reforms took the form of self-governing village committees that were elected in a competitive, democratic process. Xu Wang from Princeton University called the Congress mutually empowering for the state and the peasantry in that the state was given a renewed level of legitimacy by the democratic reforms and the peasantry was given far more political power. This manifested itself in increased voting rate, particularly for the poor, and increased levels of political awareness according to Wang's research. One example of the increased accountability from the new institutions was a province in which villagers gave 99,000 suggestions to the local government. Ultimately, 78,000 of these were adopted indicating a high rate of governmental responsiveness. This movement is considered grassroots because it focuses on systematically empowering the people. This focus manifested itself in the democratic institutions that focused on engaging the poor and in reform efforts that sought to make the government more responsive to the will of the people. [12]\nAnother instance of a historical grassroots movement was the 1980s German peace movement. The movement traces its roots to the 1950s movement opposing nuclear armament or the \"Ban the Bomb\" Movement. In the 1980s, the movement became far bigger. In 1981, 800 organizations pushed the government to reduce the military size. The push culminated in a protest by 300,000 people in the German capital Bonn. The movement was successful in producing a grassroots organization, the Coordination Committee, which directed the efforts of the peace movements in the following years. The committee ultimately failed to decrease the size of the German military, but it laid the groundwork for protests of the Iraq war in the 2000s. Further, the movement started public dialogue about policy directed at peace and security. Like the Civil Rights Movement, the German Peace movement is considered grassroots because it focused on political change starting at the local level. [13]\nA further example of grassroots in the 1980s was the Citizens Clearinghouse for Natural Waste, an organization that united communities and various grassroots groups in America in support of more environmentally friendly methods of dealing with natural waste. The movement focused especially on African American communities and other minorities. It sought to bring awareness to those communities and alter the focus from moving problematic waste to changing the system that produced such waste. The movement is considered grassroots because it utilized strategies that derived their power from the affected communities. For example, in North Carolina, African American communities lay down in front of dump trucks to protest their environmental impact. The success of these movements largely remains to be seen. [14]\nStrategies of grassroots movements[edit]\nGrassroots movements use tactics that build power from local and community movements. Grassroots Campaigns, a non-profit organization dedicated to creating and supporting grassroots movements in America says that grassroots movements aim to raise money, build organizations, raise awareness, build name recognition, to win campaigns and to deepen political participation. Grassroots movements work toward these and other goals via strategies focusing on local participation in either local or national politics. [15]\nGrassroots organizations derive their power from the people, thus their strategies seek to engage ordinary people in political discourse to the greatest extent possible. Below is a list of strategies considered to be grassroots because of their focus on engaging the populace. [4]\nHosting house meetings or parties\nHaving larger meetings— AGMs\nPutting up posters\nTalking with pedestrians on the street or walking door-to-door (often involving informational clipboards)\nGathering signatures for petitions\nMobilizing letter-writing, phone-calling and emailing campaigns\nSetting up information tables\nRaising money from many small donors for political advertising or campaigns\nOrganizing large demonstrations\nAsking individuals to submit opinions to media outlets and government officials\nHolding get out the vote activities, which include the practices of reminding people to vote and transporting them to polling places.\nUse of online social networks[edit]\nSocial media's prominence in political and social activism has skyrocketed in the last decade. Influencers on apps like Instagram and Twitter have all become hot spots for growing grassroots movements as platforms to inform, excite and organize.\nHashtags[edit]\nAnother influential way media is used to organize is through the use of hashtags to group together postings from across the network under a unifying message. Some hashtags that stirred up larger media coverage include the #MeToo movement, started in 2017 in response to sexual assault allegations against prominent figures in the American entertainment industry. Grassroots movements also use hashtags to organize on a large scale on social media. Some examples include:\nBlackLivesMatter, this hashtag demonstrates how what starts as a media campaign can take footing to be a form of embodying an entire movement. [16]\nLoveWins. After the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage, supporters used the hashtag #LoveWins.\nResist: This hashtag, used in cities throughout America, is another example of the power of organization through media platforms. It was used by event planning sites like Meetup.com to bring together members of a community who wanted to get involved politically. It was used in the case of #Resist:Dallas for such purposes.\nGrassroots activism partnered with social media may be shaping the way in which citizens organize, engage and protest in an intensely digital age.\nEnoughIsEnough: originating from survivors of the Parkland school shooting in Florida, U.S., this hashtag calls for political action to prevent shootings.\nExamples[edit]\nBarry Goldwater 1964 presidential campaign[edit]\nMain article: Barry Goldwater 1964 presidential campaign\nThe junior senator from Arizona and standard-bearer of conservative Republicans, Barry Goldwater announced his candidacy on January 3, 1964. Goldwater focused on goals such as reducing the size of the federal government, lowering taxes, promoting free enterprise and a strong commitment to U.S. global leadership and fighting communism; which appealed strongly to conservatives in the Republican Party.\nDespite vehement opposition from the leaders of his party's dominant moderate-liberal wing, such as New York governor Nelson Rockefeller and Michigan governor George Romney; Goldwater secured the Republican nomination. He sparked a grassroots movement among young conservatives by presenting himself as honest, committed and a genuine politician. The majority of his campaign donations were made by individual supporters; and only one-third of donations were greater than $500.\nBernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign[edit]\nMain article: Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign\nThe junior United States senator and former Representative from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, formally announced his 2016 presidential campaign on May 26, 2015 on the foundation of reversing \"obscene levels\" of income and wealth inequality. [17] [18] Sanders stated that he would run an issue-oriented and positive campaign, focusing his efforts on getting corporate money out of politics, raising taxes on the wealthy, guaranteeing tuition-free higher education, incorporating a single-payer healthcare system, fighting against climate change and other key issues. [19] [20]\nSanders didn't have the resources to run a massive presidential campaign across the United States, so he utilized passionate[peacock prose] volunteer organizers across the nation to build the movement.[citation needed] Millions inspired by Sanders were able to elevate the campaign to challenge the Democratic front-runner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, before ultimately losing. [21] Sanders used his grassroots campaign to receive more than 7 million individual contributions averaging $27, effectively breaking Barack Obama's previous individual contribution record in 2008. [22]\nUK grassroots aid movement[edit]\nIn 2015 the refugee crisis became front-page news across the world. [23] Affected by images of the plight of refugees arriving and travelling across Europe, the grassroots aid movement (otherwise known as the people-to-people or people solidarity movement), consisting of thousands of private individuals with no prior NGO experience, began in earnest to self-organise and form groups taking aid to areas of displaced persons. [24] The first wave of early responders reached camps in Calais and Dunkirk in August 2015 [25] and joined forces with existing local charities supporting the inhabitants there. [24] Other volunteers journeyed to support refugees across the Balkans, Macedonia and the Greek islands. [26] Grassroots aid filled voids and saved lives by plugging gaps in the system between governments and existing charities. [27]\nThe Axis of Justice[edit]\nThe Axis of Justice (AofJ) is a not-for-profit group co-founded by Tom Morello and Serj Tankian. [28] Its intended purpose is to promote social justice by connecting musicians and music enthusiasts to progressive grassroots ideals. The group appears at music festivals; the most prominent being Lollapalooza in 2003. The Axis of Justice most regularly appears whenever the bands System of a Down or Audioslave are performing. The group also has a podcast on XM Satellite radio and KPFK (90.7 FM), a Pacifica Radio station in Los Angeles, California. The AofJ's mission is to connect local music fans to organizations, local and global, aimed at effectively working on issues like peace, human rights and economic justice within communities.\nCriticism[edit]\nIssues with horizontal movements[edit]\nGrassroots movements are usually criticized because the recent rise in social media has resulted in leaderless and horizontal movements. Some argue that social movements without a clear hierarchy are far less effective and are more likely to die off. [29]\nAstroturfing[edit]\nMain article: Astroturfing\nAstroturfing refers to political action that is meant to appear to be grassroots, that is spontaneous and local, but in fact comes from an outside organization, such as a corporation or think tank. [30] [31] It is named after AstroTurf, a brand of artificial grass .\nAn example of astroturfing was the ExxonMobil Corporation's push to disseminate false information about climate change. ExxonMobil was largely successful both in disseminating the information through think tanks and in disguising the true nature of the think tanks. [32]\nMore controversial examples of astroturfing often exhibit some characteristics of a real grassroots organization, but also characteristics of astroturf. Many of President Obama's efforts, for example, have been deemed grassroots because of their focus on involving the electorate at large. Critics of Obama have argued that some of these methods are in fact astroturfing because they believe that Obama faked the grassroots support. For example, the Reason Foundation has accused Obama of planting astroturf supporters in town hall meetings. Many movements and organizations must be placed on a continuum between grassroots and astroturf instead of labeled entirely as one or the other. For example, Australia's Convoy of No Confidence, a movement seeking to force an early election in 2011, incorporated elements of grassroots infrastructure in its reliance on the anger and discontentment of the participants. It also had elements of astroturf, namely the large extent to which it relied on support from political elites in the opposition party. [33]\nThe Tea Party, a conservative force in American politics that began in 2009, is also a controversial example of astroturfing. Critics, notably including Former President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, dismissed the Tea Party as Astroturf. They say that the movement purports to represent large swaths of America when in reality it comes from a select few billionaires seeking policies favorable to themselves. The Tea Party has defended itself, arguing that it comes out of broad popular support and widespread anger at the Democratic Party and disenchantment with the GOP. Defenders of the Tea Party cite polls that find substantial support, indicating that the movement has some basis in grassroots politics. Critics point to the corporate influence on the Tea Party, which they believe indicates that the movement is more top-down than the grassroots rhetoric would suggest. The Tea Party can be considered grassroots to the extent that it comes from the people, but it is considered astroturfing to the extent that it is shaped by corporations and particularly wealthy individuals. [34]\nCurrent examples[edit]\nEarth Hour International - Created by WWF Australia and advertising agency Leo Burnett Sydney and Fairfax Media, has described itself as \"the world's largest grass roots movement\" [35]\nBernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016: this has been deemed by some as a grassroots campaign because of its focus on small donations, massive rallies and other grassroots style politicking methods. [36]\nMomentum in the United Kingdom: it has been described as a grassroots movement supportive of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party.[37]\nUse in sport - The term \"grassroots\" is used by a number of sporting organizational bodies to reference the lowest, most elementary form of the game that anyone can play. Focusing on the grassroots of a sporting code can lead to greater participation numbers, greater support of professional teams/athletes and ultimately provide performance and financial benefits to the organization to invest into the growth and development of the sport. [38] [39] Some examples of this are FIFA 's Grassroots Programme and the Football Federation Australia 's \"Goals for Grassroots\" initiative.

Evans\nAmy has a BA/MA Criminal Justice. Worked with youth for over 20 years in academic settings. Avid reader, history and mystery lover.\nCommunities are the subject of this lesson. We will go over the definition of what a community is and explore the motivations and characteristics of communities. Updated: 10/04/2020\nWhat is a Community?\nWhat is a community to you? Is it a group of living organisms that share an ecosystem? Is it the people you join in fellowship when you gather to share your faith tradition? Is it the neighborhood you live in? What about universities where people go to learn and teach and some live? Are they communities? If you answered yes, to all the above, you would be correct. Communities can be found in all kinds of incarnations around the world and you can have a role in more than one community.\nA community is a place where people live, play, work, interact with one another in a number of ways. Communities are a source of identity and security where people interact with each other within a set of norms and rules that they create. These communities exist within a larger society and may also have smaller communities within them. In other words, communities can be layered one within the other.\nFor example, American society has urban communities (cities) that in turn have neighborhoods, that in turn have churches, social organizations, sports teams, etc... all of which are examples of communities. Let us explore what motivates humans to build communities and the characteristics that many have in common.\nLesson\nQuiz\nCourse\n260 views\nMotivation to Build Communities\nWhat motivates humans to build communities? Well, there are a lot of reasons that gathering to live in a group makes sense. These reasons include, but are not exclusive too, the following:\nPooling of resources\nSafety and security\nShared interests\nShared goals\nShared culture\nShared ethnicity\nFreedom to practice or not practice a religion\nFreedom to express one's personal thoughts and opinions\nCharacteristics of Communities\nFirst of all, members of communities identify with one another in some way, they have enough things in common that make living together advantageous and while not all communities are the same, they do share some characteristics that can be generally applied.\nCommunities often occupy a specific space or locale, although some communities may have a more universal or worldwide reach.\nRules and laws are a characteristic of communities; they set boundaries and communicate what is and what is not acceptable behavior\nCommunities have active members who are invested in the success of their community and who can effectively communicate with one another.\nCommunities have some sort of administrative structure made up of members of the community who have the authority to tax, and fine members, as well as, offer up initiatives to be voted on that provide for community needs, such as mass transit, libraries, infrastructure, schools and hospitals.\nCommunities have shared values and understandings between their members on how to do things, such as socializing.\nMembers of communities share their resources amongst one another.\nCommunities have goals and societal roles meant to benefit the community, as well as individual members of the community.\nCommunities have institutions for enforcing rules, laws, norms and for the distribution of resources. For example, they have some sort of system for accountability, such as law enforcement and courts.\nExamples of Historical Figures in Community Building\nCommunities do not just spring up unannounced. They oftentimes have people of vision, people who motivate the creation of a community. For example, John Winthrop dreamed of creating a community for Puritans fleeing religious persecution in England. He made this dream a reality called Boston, Massachusetts, in 1630, when he set sail with eleven ships for the shores of the New World.\nJames Madison, also referred to as the Father of the American Constitution, wrote the first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution, was crucial in structuring the type of government the United States would have, including the institutions and their specific roles in the community and the rules and rights of citizens that belonged to the new nation.\nIn South Africa, former Black African Nelson Mandela helped transform his community and free it of apartheid where whites and blacks shared power and representation in the government and small communities, such as Cape Town and Johannesburg took down barriers that had long separated colored communities from white communities, creating a more equitable system and equal rights for all citizens, regardless of ethnicity.\nSocial Science / TExES Core Subjects EC-6 - Social Studies (903): Practice & Study Guide", "What is the definition of civilized society?\nWhat is the definition of civilized society?\nAsked By: Aivaras Daubler | Last Updated: 13th January, 2020\nCategory: music and audio society and culture podcasts\n5/5 (652 Views . 17 Votes)\nA civilized society or country has a well developed system of government, culture, and way of life and that treats the people who live there fairly: A fair justice system is a fundamental part of a civilized society.

Where these factors rank can change between societies. A strong middle class is another sign of a civilized society.\nAgriculture is often credited with starting civilization. Agriculture allows one person to feed many, allowing other people to focus on other tasks. This job specialization has helped cultures develop writing, trade and other aspects of modern civilization, and it has allowed people to settle down in one location instead of having to live nomadic lifestyles.\nEffective government is a cornerstone of civilized societies. Whether the government is a monarchy, democracy or dictatorship, a strong government is needed to enforce laws and keep people safe from foreign and domestic threats. Governments are also able to invest in infrastructure that citizens can use. Public-use roads, for example, typically require government approval and financing.\nEducation, science and art all play a role in civilized society, and these fields have been high priorities for thousands of years. An educated population tends to be less violent and happier, and art and entertainment help build cultural cohesion. Societies that invest in science are typically able to provide a better quality of life; modern medicine, for example, has led to longer lives.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMORE FROM REFERENCE.COM\nWorld View\nHow to Register a URL for Your Website\nHistory\nCapers, Cults & Costumes: The Curious Ancient History of April Fools’ Day\nScience\nWhy Are Watersheds Important?\nWorld View\nWhat Is a “No-Fly Zone” — and Is This How NATO Can Help Ukraine?\nWorld View\n7 Tips to Help You Fight Climate Change With Your Home Garden\nPets & Animals\nAre Human Diets Really Safe for Pets?\nADVERTISEMENT\nTrending Articles\nYes, Jorō Spiders Parachuting Over the East Coast Is a Real Threat — Here’s Why\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT", "Community - Sociology - Oxford Bibliographies\nCommunity\nZachary P.

This bibliography focuses primarily on human communities, and although many different definitions have been offered, most involve a few basic claims. First, a community is a group of people who interact with one another, for example, as friends or neighbors. Second, this interaction is typically viewed as occurring within a bounded geographic territory, such as a neighborhood or city. Third, the community’s members often share common values, beliefs, or behaviors. This bibliography includes sources for general overviews of community, journals publishing research on community, and entries organized under three major headings: Defining Community, Community Processes, and Finding Other Communities. Defining Community lists works that have attempted to define the concept of community, and to locate and characterize specific communities. Community Processes lists works that explore the wide range of social, political, and economic processes that take place within communities and that shape communities as they change over time. Finding Other Communities lists works that consider human communities that exist outside the mainstream, and that seek to explore community as a more abstract notion that goes beyond face-to-face human communities, including Internet-based virtual communities and communities of nonhuman entities, such as dolphins or protein molecules.\nGeneral Overviews\nBecause community is such a broad topic, no single work can provide a comprehensive overview of the concept. These works offer a general introduction and may serve as references sources that point to more specific aspects of community. Christensen and Levinson 2003 and Delanty 2010 provide broad and encyclopedic coverage of several aspects of community. Adopting a different approach, Neal 2013 introduces a social network approach to understanding community, and provides a general overview from this perspective.\nChristensen, Karen, and David Levinson. 2003. Encyclopedia of community: From the village to the virtual world. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE.\nThis multivolume encyclopedia includes over five hundred entries on topics ranging from specific communities (e.g., Amana, Amish, Arcosanti) to the problems that contemporary communities face (e.g., vigilantism, xenophobia).\nDelanty, Gerard. 2010.

This is more so following a major catastrophic event such as a natural disaster, or in the case of Iraq, a war. The conference held in July 2007 on rebuilding Iraqi communities identified community participation as a significant factor in national reconstruction: \n\nThe central objective of the conference is to provide an intellectual forum for scholars and practitioners from Iraq and everywhere else in the world, to explore how the reconstruction of Iraq can be carried out in a way that promotes social justice, economic and political sustainability, and the full participation of all stakeholders (Awotona 2007).\n\nThe U.S. has a long history of community participation in national development, and some of the lessons learned from this experience could be applicable to Iraq as the country contemplates reconstruction efforts to amend a shattered nation after the war.\nFor development practitioners such as urban planners, community participation in development has long been recognized as essential for ensuring that development plans reflect the needs and wishes of a country’s residents. As Burby (2003) observed: \n\nStrong plans stem from planning processes that involve a broad array of stakeholders, and strong plans accompanied by broad stakeholder involvement are needed if plans are to have a significant effect on the actions of local governments.”(p. 33).\n\nMileti (1999) put it even more forcefully when he said: “The participatory process itself may be as important as the outcome” (p. 6).

In this disaster-prone country, effective community coping capacity has developed, largely to fill community-level needs for disaster preparation, mitigation, and response. Experience with three concepts of disaster planning and management, namely “Kyojo” (Neighborhood or Community Self-Reliance), “Jijo” (Individual or Household Self-Reliance), and “Kojo” (Government Assistance), is recounted and assessed. Then three structures for disaster management, Jiishu-bosai-soshiki (Self-support Disaster Reduction Association), “Machizukuri” (citizen-led town-creation), and “Toshikeikaku” (urban or city planning), are discussed. Finally, the contributions of the three papers in this special issue are related to Japanese community practices and to the broader perspective of group decision and negotiation.\nDownload to read the full article text\nReferences\nAckermann F, Eden C (2010) The role of group decision support systems: negotiating safe energy.

This chapter focuses on improving disaster risk reduction efforts aimed at building community resilience through an investigation of the influencing factors in the Stop Disaster Game for disaster management and disaster preparedness. Based on previous research into the use of such a game by at-risk communities in Yogyakarta, the chapter further aims to develop an empirical model of the decision-making process and raise awareness of the community’s vulnerability to natural hazards, and to enhance effective collaboration amongst relevant stakeholders. For this research, a descriptive-qualitative method was used and an online survey was conducted with 202 respondents. The results from the survey were analysed using the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) to create an empirical model of decision-making processes based on the level of awareness of disaster risks and disaster management. The research found that the stronger the capacity of the at-risk community in understanding risk and to respond to disaster, the greater their willingness to contribute to and collaborate in the decision-making process for disaster risk reduction in Yogyakarta. This highlights the need to improve the community’s capacity and literacy regarding disaster risk, disaster preparedness, and disaster risk reduction. The gamification, in this context, is a potential strategy to facilitate the integration of community participation in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation planning.\nNo full-text available\nCommunity Engagement for Disaster Resilience: Flood Risk Management in Jakarta, Indonesia\nConference Paper\nFull-text available\nSep 2014\nTri Mulyani Sunarharum\nMellini Sloan\nConnie Susilawati\nView\nShow abstract\nThe Collective Action of Urban Communities in Disaster Risk Reduction: A Case Study in Yogyakarta City\nArticle\nFull-text available\nApr 2020\nP Yuanjaya\nHidayatul Fajri\nView\nShow abstract\nWhen to use and how to report the results of PLS-SEM\nArticle\nFull-text available\nDec 2018\nEur Bus Rev\nHair, Joseph F., Jr\nJeff Risher\nMarko Sarstedt\nChristian M.

Based on semi-structured interviews conducted with municipal government officials and community leaders in the cities of Miyako and Kesennuma in January 2013, this study identifies the ways in which local communities have defined, prioritized and adopted a set of objectives and measures for long-term reconstruction, and how these will likely affect the disaster risk and community rebuilding in the coming years. Particular attention is paid to the debate surrounding tsunami defense measures, including the rebuilding of sea walls, the relocation of communities, and other land-use adjustments, and how multi-layered governance plays out in balancing the need for swift recovery, optimal resource allocation, and future disaster risk reduction. Since the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, the national recovery policy has stressed the need to build 'tsunami-resilient' communities, envisioning the construction of multi-buffer tsunami defense systems characterized by coastal land-use restrictions based on nationally determined guidelines of relatively frequent to extreme rare tsunamis. While this hands-on approach by the national government has contributed to streamlining the reconstruction processes, limited opportunities for citizen participation have contributed to tensions among stakeholders, calling into question the community ownership of decision-making following a disaster.\nContent uploaded by Junko Mochizuki\nAuthor content\nContent may be subject to copyright.\n... Ακρογωνιαίο λίθο της διαχείρισης καταστροφών στην Ιαπωνία συνιστά όμως η θέσμιση, το 1961, μετά τον τυφώνα Ise-wan το 1959, της Βασικής Πράξης για Μέτρα Αντιμετώπισης Καταστροφών. Αυτή προβλέπει αυξημένο ρόλο της εθνικής κυβέρνησης στην πρόληψη των καταστροφών και στην αποκατάσταση, παρότι μόνο 4 από τα 109 άρθρα της αναφέρονται σε αυτήν (Mochizuki, 2014). Η Βασική Πράξη για Μέτρα Αντιμετώπισης Καταστροφών εξακολουθεί, αναθεωρούμενη και τροποποιούμενη, να αποτελεί τη θεσμική ραχοκοκαλιά της διαχείρισης καταστροφών στη χώρα.  ...\n...

Προσδιορίστηκαν λοιπόν, 24 παράκτιες ζώνες στην Περιφέρεια Iwate, 22 στην Περιφέρεια Miyagi και 14 στην Περιφέρεια Fukushima, όπου θα κατασκευαστούν προστατευτικοί τοίχοι με χρηματοδότηση της κεντρικής κυβέρνησης (Mochizuki, 2014).  ...\n... Μετακαταστροφικά, εκδόθηκε ένα σύνολο νομικών ρυθμίσεων αναφορικά με την αποκατάσταση και την ανασυγκρότηση, μεταξύ αυτών 7 νόμοι για την υποστήριξη των θυμάτων, 5 για την αποκατάσταση και το «machizukuri», 3 για την ανασυγκρότηση των επιχειρήσεων, 6 για την υποστήριξη προς τις δημοτικές αρχές, 9 για την αντιμετώπιση του πυρηνικού ατυχήματος και 12 για θέματα χρηματοδότησης και άλλα. Επιπρόσθετα, η Κυβέρνηση κατ' εφαρμογή της Βασικής Πράξης του 1961, προχώρησε σε νομικές ρυθμί-σεις προκειμένου: α) Να συστήσει Φορέα Αποκατάστασης, β) Να δημιουργήσει ειδικές ζώνες αποκατάστασης και γ) Να εκδοθούν ομόλογα αποκατάστασης και να ληφθούν άλλα μέρα (Mochizuki, 2014).  ...\nΑνασυγκρότηση μετά το σεισμό 9.0R στην Ανατολική Ιαπωνία το 2011, εστιάζοντας στο σχεδιασμό του χώρου\nArticle\nFull-text available\nMay 2016\nMiranda Dandoulaki\nView\n... The council highly encouraged the establishment of \"town and village community development associations\" (machizukuri kyōgikai) as a practical means to incorporate the local perspective into reconstruction (Reconstruction Design Council, 2011, p. 18). However, the task of these groups is far from easy not only because of their limited power in the actual planning processes (Cho, 2014; Mochizuki, 2014), but also because the disaster drastically altered the social and physical living environments, forcing the residents to redefine those very 'communities and local characteristics' in the crossfire of multiple political interests and discourses of, for example, nostalgic hometown (furusato), social bonds and relationships (kizuna and tsunagari), and 'building back better.' Although disasters are seen as an opportunity for development (Shaw, 2014) and the 3.11 disaster as a chance to build a 'New Tōhoku' (Reconstruction Agency, n.d.), the large-scale reconstruction projects implemented in the name of 'building back better' have in fact delayed reconstruction and community recovery (Akimoto, 2018;Edgington, 2017;Nagamatsu, 2018).  ...\n... In contrast to everyday machizukuri that aim at gradual change (Evans, 2002, p. 449), the 3.11 disaster forced a rapid response with little expertise. Even today, the local authorities attempt to balance different interests within complicated governing and financial reconstruction structures (Mochizuki, 2014). Having learned from the criticism arising from excessive top-down reconstruction policies after the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in Kōbe in 1995 (Edgington, 2011b), the authorities in Tōhoku embraced rhetoric that focused on resident participation.  ...\n... Having learned from the criticism arising from excessive top-down reconstruction policies after the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in Kōbe in 1995 (Edgington, 2011b), the authorities in Tōhoku embraced rhetoric that focused on resident participation. However, in practice, the planning process was kept mostly under the control of the authorities and justified by the discourse of speed, expertise, and efficiency, which would have been lost if public consensus and participation were prioritized (Cho, 2014; Mochizuki, 2014; Watanabe, 2007; interview with Yamamoto reconstruction consultation company representative). This complicated the practical involvement of locals in the decision-making process as well as shaped the sociopolitical framework within which the machizukuri groups framed their activities.  ...\nReconstruction machizukuri and negotiating safety in post-3.11 community recovery in Yamamoto\nArticle\nDec 2018\nPilvi Posio\nView\nShow abstract\n...

Also, the reason for building on the coast was to take advantage of unlimited seawater for the secondary cooling system.

Introduction\nElectrical and electronic equipment (EEE) such as cell phones, computers, video recorders, televisions, coffee machines, refrigerators and medical devices that add ease, comfort, and luxury to the modern life have become an indispensable part of modern societies. However, short lifespan, limited repair options and fast-changing technology is turning a high proportion of electronic gadgets into waste upon the end of its usable life due to damage, non-working, operational risks, or availability of better alternatives (Montalvo et al., 2016 ). Waste EEE (e-waste), mostly defined as “electrical or electronic equipment which is waste including all components, sub-assemblies and consumables, which are part of the product at the time of discarding” (Directive, 2008) have emerged both as a global concern due to its massively high volume and health hazards associated with its improper handling, disposal, or recycling (Forti et al., 2020; Grant et al., 2013; Widmer et al., 2005 ), as well as an opportunity due to high content of extractable valuable materials. Recent reports on global e-waste statistics have estimated global generation of 53.6 million ton (Mt) e-waste during 2019 that grew from 41.8 Mt in 2014 and 44.7 Mt in 2016 with further projection to grow to 74.7 Mt by 2030 at an annual growth rate of approx. 2 Mt (Balde et al., 2017, 2015; Forti et al., 2020 ).\nE-waste generated at the household level in most of the countries is managed in three ways: (i) by dumping it to waste bins, (ii) through formal collection by government recognized bodies, and (iii) collection outside the formal system by individual waste dealers and companies (Chi et al., 2014 ). E-waste collected through authorized commercial and/or municipal collection points and pick-up services is usually recycled at facilities having advanced technology and machinery and infrastructure for safe and efficient removal of valuable materials (formal recycling). On the other hand, the e-waste collected outside the formal system by individual waste companies or dealers is mostly processed and recycled under sub-optimal conditions with primitive techniques and usually without any provisions to reduce the emission of hazardous chemicals into the environment (informal recycling) (Chi et al., 2011; Pradhan and Kumar, 2014 ). E-waste dumped into landfills or sold to peddlers often end up by polluting the environment through leaching into soil and groundwater, and via emission into the surrounding air, soil, and surface water (Cesaro et al., 2019; Man et al., 2013 ). A substantial amount of valuable resources are also lost through disposing or during recycling under inferior conditions. Thus, formal e-waste recycling is the safest way to manage e-waste. However, recent estimates suggest that only about 17.4 % (9.3 Mt) of the global e-waste generated in 2019 has been collected and recycled in the formal sector, leaving the flow of rest 44.3 Mt (82.6 %) e-waste undocumented (Forti et al., 2020 ). This suggests that most of the e-waste, particularly in Asian and African countries is managed by the informal sector. Presence of multiple precious metals (e.g. gold, platinum, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, copper, and silver) along with other valuable materials such as iron, aluminium, cobalt, indium, germanium, bismuth, and antimony, make e-waste an attractive source of economy among local scrap dealers, dismantlers and recyclers (Deubzer et al., 2019 ). Toxic substances present in EEE (e.g. heavy metals, brominated flame retardants, and polychlorinated biphenyls), or those produced during recycling activities (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans), and used for extracting metals (e.g. acids like HCl, H 2 SO 4, HNO 3, HClO 4, NaClO) are often emitted in the local environment as primary, secondary and tertiary emissions, respectively from informal recycling, leading to an increase in the levels of toxic pollutants in the ecosystem (Kumar et al., 2019; Orlins and Guan, 2016; Quan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015 ). Long term recycling activities in the informal sector compounded with long term persistence of e-waste pollutant in the environment increases the exposure risk to the waste recycling workers and the population inhabiting nearby localities and thus is a health hazard (Grant et al., 2013 ).\nTo establish a balance between the negative impact of e-waste recycling on the environment and human health, and resource reimbursement (financial), a multi-directional approach is required to holistically solve the e-waste menace while also assisting the global economy and resource conservation. Numerous reviews on one or the other aspects of e-waste generation and its recycling: global e-waste generation and management (Awasthi and Li, 2017; Kumar et al., 2017 ), e-waste recycling process and methods (Islam et al., 2020 ), regulation and legislation (Kumar and Singh, 2013 ), role in the circular economy (Pini et al., 2019 ), impact on the environment and human health (Awasthi et al., 2016; Grant et al., 2013; Vaccari et al., 2019 ), and sustainable management (Ravindra and Mor, 2019) have been published. However, very few of them provide a holistic picture covering most of the aspects of e-waste generation and recycling including the environmental and occupational health concern, economic and legal issues and strategies to address such issues.\nThis review provides a comprehensive account of the current trend in global e-waste generation, the latest approaches in e-waste recycling, environmental and occupational health concerns, opportunities and constraints in effective e-waste management, and solutions for improved e-waste recycling. Besides, we have also discussed the mechanism of toxicity of a few of the prominent pollutants associated with e-waste generation and recycling. Further, key regulations and legislative framework on e-waste management among countries generating major amount of e-waste were provided. Moreover, we have also commented on the potential strategies for improved and effective e-waste management.\n2. Current status on global e-waste generation\nThe rate of generation of e-waste at the global level has increased substantively in recent years. While previous estimates suggested an annual growth rate of 3–4 % (ASSOCHAM-NEC, 2018; Balde et al., 2017, 2015 ), by the year 2019, the growth rate of global e-waste generation has increased to around 6% (Forti et al., 2020 ). The global e-waste generated in 2019 is estimated comprising 17.4 Mt small equipment, 13.1 Mt large equipment, 10.8 Mt temperature exchange equipment, 6.7 Mt screens and monitors, 4.7 Mt small IT and telecommunication equipment, and 0.9 Mt lamps (Forti et al., 2020 ). Detailed quantities of e-waste generated by individual countries in the year 2019, as well as detailed classification of EEE under above mentioned six major subheads are provided in the ‘Global E-waste Monitor 2020’ report (Forti et al., 2020 ). The continent-wise figures of e-waste generated during 2014–2019, and countries which generated the highest e-waste within each continent in 2019 are shown in Fig. 1. It is worth noting here that in each successive year, both total e-waste as well as per capita generation of e-waste has increased among all the continents .\nDownload : Download high-res image (730KB)\nDownload : Download full-size image\nFig. 1. Global e-waste statistics. (A) Top 25 countries of the world that generated highest e-waste in 2016 and 2019. (B) Continent-wise figures of e-waste generated during 2014, 2016 and 2019. (C) Continent-wise share of top e-waste generating countries during 2019. (D) Global e-waste generation by product category. Note: 1 Mt corresponds to 10 9 kg and 1 kt corresponds to 10 6 kg. ‘eq.’ = Equipment; ‘Temp. exc. eq.’ = Temperature Exchange Equipment. Data has been sourced from previous studies (Balde et al., 2017, 2015; Forti et al., 2020 ).\nAsia with its 17 countries contributed the highest share of e-waste in 2019. China, India, Japan, and Indonesia generated most of the e-waste among Asian countries. Many nations in Asia are covered by nation-based e-waste legislation which prohibit trans-boundary movement of e-waste, and mandate formal collection of generated e-waste for recycling at government-recognized setups with appropriate technology (Table 1 ). For a comprehensive analysis of e-waste legislation worldwide, the recent article by Patil et al. and other may be referred (Patil and Ramakrishna, 2020; Kumar et al., 2017; Pathak et al., 2017; Patil and Ramakrishna, 2020; Wei and Liu, 2012; Zeng et al., 2013) Despite various policies on e-waste management in many Asian nations, only a marginal increase in e-waste recycling at formal setups has taken place and has not kept pace with the unmatched increase in total e-waste generation . Limited coverage of EEE under e-waste management rules, lack of effective enforcement of regional and international e-waste legislation and treaties, and unprofessional standards of e-waste disposal, collection, and recycling are believed to be contributing to persisting informal recycling under sub-optimal conditions in Asian countries (Balde et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Wei and Liu, 2012 ).\nTable 1.

North and South America have been estimated to have generated approximately 11−13 Mt e-waste annually in the past six years, with per capita contribution of approximately 12−13 kg/inhabitant per year. While European nations too maintained their total e-waste generation to around 12 Mt in the last six years; they recorded a substantial decrease in per capita generation of e-waste because of their stringent e-waste management practices. Also, the average e-waste collection and recycling through the formal system in Europe was comparatively higher (5.1 Mt) than the Americas (1.2 Mt). Most of the European nations (as part of the European Union) are covered by the EU directives to follow regulations on transparent and systematic management of generated e-waste, whereas only a few countries like the USA and Canada in the Americas have provincial laws to manage e-waste (Wang et al., 2016 ).\nAfrica and Oceania were reported to generate the least amount of e-waste in the past six years. The highest quantities of e-waste among 49 African nations analyzed for their share of e-waste was recorded from Egypt (585 kilo ton), South Africa (415 kt), Nigeria (461 kt) and Algeria (308 kt). E-waste management in Africa is still dominated by the informal sector due to the lack of either specific e-waste legislation or their implementation. In Oceania (among 12 countries analyzed for e-waste generation), Australia and New Zealand (650 kilo ton; 21.3 kg/capita) recorded generating the most of the e-waste. Most of the African and Oceanian countries either do not have e-waste management laws or schemes to solve the e-waste problem and deal with the informal recycling. However, Australia (Oceania) has enacted the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme (2011) to increase the rate of recycling of televisions and computers to 80 % by 2026–2027 through industry-based collection and recycling initiatives (EPHC, 2010 ). Also, the dumping of e-waste in landfills is banned in Australia to encourage safe management of hazardous materials and increase recovery of the valuable materials.\n3. Exposure to pollutants associated with e-waste: mechanism of toxicity and environmental and occupational health concerns\nE-waste recycling without appropriate measures to limit environmental pollution can add a variety of organic and inorganic pollutants such as heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) into the ecosystem which can adversely affect human health. This section discusses exposure to e-waste toxicants and mechanisms of their toxicity. Epidemiological findings highlighting health consequences in e-waste workers and population inhabiting nearby localities to sites of e-waste recycling (mostly in the informal settings) are also provided.\n3.1. Exposure to e-waste pollutants\nThe toxic components contained in e-waste depend on the type of EEE. Besides, the emission of toxic components and their derivatives into environment is dependent of the method used for processing and recycling. Various metals and organic compounds are added to the EEE in trace quantities for various purposes, such as to impart mechanical support and strength, enhance electrical and thermal conductance, resistance to flame and weathering conditions, and other added benefits (Table S3). Being embedded in EEE, these components impose minimal adverse effects on human health when the EEE is intact. However, upon emission into the environment through recycling activities, such as dismantling, size reduction, and burning or heating these get released into the environment.\nPresence of various primary e-waste toxicants (hazardous substances present in e-waste, e.g. Pb, Cd, Hg and PCBs) and secondary e-waste toxicants (produced during processing and recycling of e-waste, e.g. PAHs, dioxins and difurans) in the environment of the Guiyu town of China, Agbogbloshie of Ghana, National Capital Territory (NCT) region in India, Shershah (Karachi) in Pakistan, Lagos in Nigeria, and Dhaka in Bangladesh (all well-known e-waste dump yards) has been widely reported (RajyaSabha, 2011; Sthiannopkao and Wong, 2013 ). For instance, Seelampur and Mandoli industrial area in Delhi, India have been reported for contamination of drains and surface soil from discarded acid wastes that carry unrecovered metals like Sb, Cu, Pb, Ni, Sn, Zn, As and Se (Brigden et al., 2005; Pradhan and Kumar, 2014 ). Similarly, high concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) have been detected in the indoor dust from TV dismantling workshops in east China and Vietnam (Anh et al., 2017; Deng et al., 2014a; Wang et al., 2010b ). Presence of PBDE, particularly the BDE-47 and BDE-99, and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) has been found in soil sediments of Dayan River near an electronic waste site in Qingyuan (Zheng et al., 2015 ). Bioaccumulation of PBDEs, especially the BDE-209 has been found in fishes collected from ponds near to e-waste recycling localities in Vietnam (Anh et al., 2017 ). Various low and high molecular weight PAHs such as phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene have been reported in soil and vegetations near recycling or dumping sites in South China and Nigeria (Adeyi and Oyeleke, 2017; Wang et al., 2012 ). Multiple studies evidenced the presence of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants at informal e-waste recycling sites coming mainly from crude processing, such as open burning and discharge of acid bath effluents into soil, water and other habitats (Awasthi et al., 2016; Vaccari et al., 2019 ).\nExposure to toxic e-waste components may result from inhalation, ingestion or upon dermal contact at workplace (occupational) or through contaminated air, water, soil and food items. Workers engaged in recycling activities, elderly people, children, and pregnant women residing near e-waste recycling units are highly susceptible to adverse health effects of e-waste toxicants (Chimere May et al., 2018; Ohajinwa et al., 2019 ). Particularly, children and infants, owing to the possibility of in utero exposure, intense hand-to-mouth activity, high rate of breathing, frequent breast-feeding and food intake, and low rate of toxicant removal are considered the most vulnerable group for e-waste exposure (Guo et al., 2010, 2012; Xu et al., 2018, 2012 ).\n3.2. Mechanism of e-waste toxicity\nWhile many of the environmental pollutants including those generated during e-waste recycling may have different mechanisms through which they can affect various body systems, their co-existence in the environment and simultaneous exposure to different magnitudes of dose, duration and routes make it extremely challenging to delineate their exact roles in various health conditions among exposed population. These challenges notwithstanding, significant progress has been made to uncover the possible mechanism of toxic effects of various e-waste toxicants.\n3.2.1. Molecular mechanism of heavy metals toxicity\nCellular exposure to heavy metals is known to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and deplete antioxidants. Multiple studies have indicated that redox active metal ions, such as Fe(II), Cu(II), Cr(VI), or As(III) upon getting oxidized by the by-products of aerobic respiration (e.g. hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and superoxide (O 2 − )) can initiate autoxidation driven by Fenton reaction, leading to production of highly reactive hydroxyl radical (OH) and hydroxide (OH −) (Flora et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2017 ). These reactive oxygen species (ROS) can form additional free radicals such as thiyl radical (RS ), carbon-centred radical ((R) 3 C) and peroxyl radical ((R) 3 COO) upon reacting with other cellular biomolecules and may damage cellular proteins, lipids, DNA and polysaccharides among other cellular machineries (Fig. 2) (Godwill et al., 2019; Lemire et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013 ).\nDownload : Download high-res image (335KB)\nDownload : Download full-size image\nFig. 2. Toxicological mechanisms of heavy metals in humans. Exposure to heavy metals result in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which may lead to depletion of antioxidants, alteration of enzyme and protein function, damage to the cell membrane, interference in the activity of transporters and genotoxicity.\nMetal catalyzed oxidation of amino acid residues, such as histidine, arginine, lysine and proline adjacent to metal binding sites in proteins (form carbonyl derivatives) may result in loss of enzyme activity as well as protein dysfunction and degradation (Stadtman, 1993 ). Similarly, exchange of catalytic metals or structural metals, for example, displacement of metallic cofactor Zn(II) by Pb(II) from catalytic site of heme synthesizing enzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (Jaffe et al., 2001 ), and substitutions of Ni(II) for cofactor Zn(II) at non-catalytic site of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (an enzyme involved in glycolysis) (Macomber et al., 2011 ), and destruction of catalytic Fe–S clusters (2Fe – 2S; 3Fe – 3S; 4Fe – 4S) in proteins involved in electron transfer, enzymatic reactions, and RNA and DNA metabolism, can potentially lead to site-specific enzyme inhibition (Vernis et al., 2017; Xu and Imlay, 2012 ). Moreover, these metals can form disulphide bonds with sulphur atom in amino-acid residues in glutathione, L-cysteine, NAD(P)H and FADH 2 due to their electron-sharing affinities, thus depleting the anti-oxidant reserves of the cell (Lemire et al., 2013 ). Oxidative breakdown of lipids, particularly at the methylene bridges (-CH 2 -) in polyunsaturated fatty acids or glycolipids by, for example Cu(II) and Cd(II) catalysed ROS can result in loss of membrane potential and integrity leading to impaired membrane function (Flora et al., 2008 ). Both oxidative stress mediated damage and inactivation of key proteins involved in DNA synthesis and repair are known as causative factors for metal-associated genotoxicity. Free radicals such as OH can react to nucleobases or 2-deoxyribose moiety resulting in DNA damage such as base lesions, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, and formation of inter-strand and intra-strand base cross-links, and DNA–protein cross-links (Cadet and Wagner, 2013 ). Inhibition of mismatch repair protein by metal ions or its effectors can result in propagation of unrepaired errors which may lead to mutations and cellular apoptosis (Jin et al., 2003 ). Also, some heavy metals such as Cr(VI) or Ga(III) are known to starve the cells of essential micronutrients, e.g. sulphate and Fe by interfering in their uptake through various mechanism (Lemire et al., 2013 ). Exposure to heavy metals has also been shown to result in neurological and behavioural disorders, diseases of nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, reproductive, and immune systems, and cancers of the bladder and lungs (Jarup, 2003; Rebelo and Caldas, 2016; Rehman et al., 2018; Song and Li, 2015 ).\n3.2.2. Molecular mechanism of PAH and dioxins toxicity\nPAHs and dioxins are produced as by-products during combustion of e-waste components. PAHs are lipophilic in nature, and enter pulmonary cells via passive diffusion upon inhalation or ingestion. They activate cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenases, like CYP1A1/2 and CYP1B1, and cellular enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases, UDP glucuronyl transferases, NADPH quinone oxidoreductases (NQOs), aldo-keto reductases (AKRs), and epoxide hydrolases (EHs) through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent and AhR-independent pathways including mainly the CYP1A1/1B1 and epoxide hydrolase pathway (CYP/EH), CYP peroxidase pathway (CYPP), and aldo-keto reductases pathway (AKR) (Moorthy et al., 2015 ). During this process, the PAHs are transformed to its active carcinogenic metabolites like diol-epoxides, radical cations, and reactive and redox-active o-quinones which may react with DNA to produce DNA adducts that can lead to DNA mutation, abnormal gene expression, and tumorigenesis (Fig. 3) (Moorthy et al., 2015 ). The toxicity due to PAH exposure is further enhanced by the metabolic processes which generate reactive metabolites such as epoxides and dihydrodiols (Burchiel and Luster, 2001; Moorthy et al., 2015 ). Such metabolites cause DNA adduct formation and may lead to mutations apart from protein adduct formation (Burchiel and Luster, 2001 ). Besides, exposure to PAHs has been found to cause oxidative stress leading to oxidative damage to DNA, oxidation of proteins, lipid peroxidation and membrane damage (Deng et al., 2014b ). Chronic exposure to PAHs, in ecological settings, has been found to be associated with reduction in immune function, liver and kidney damage, retarded lung function and enhanced risk of cancers of various organs viz. lung, skin, bladder, and gastro-intestine (Armstrong et al., 2004; Bostrom et al., 2002; Burchiel and Luster, 2001; Kim et al., 2013 ).\nDownload : Download high-res image (383KB)\nDownload : Download full-size image\nFig. 3. Mechanisms of PAH and dioxins toxicity in humans. PAHs and dioxins are metabolized by various enzymatic pathways to its carcinogenic derivatives (diol-epoxides, radical cations and redox-active o-quinones) that cause DNA adduct formation which can lead to altered gene expression and tumorigenesis. Here, CYP-cytochrome P450 monoxygenases; EH-epoxide hydrolases; AKR- aldo-keto reductases; AhR-aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Hsp-Heat shock protein 90; XAP2-Hepatits B Virus X protein associated protein 2 (also called aryl hydrocarbon receptor-associated protein 9).\nToxic effects of the dioxins appear to be mediated via genomic and non-genomic pathways by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Dioxins entering the cells via diffusion can bind the cytosolic AhR complexed to chaperone proteins Hsp90-p23-XAP2 (heat shock protein 90, prostaglandin E synthase 3, and the immunophilin-like protein – hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2) leading to dissociation and translocation of AhR-dioxin complex into the nucleus where it recruits AhR nuclear translocator, transcriptional proteins, co-activators and co-repressors to bind the promoter regions (xenobiotics response elements) of target genes to exhibit altered expressions (Fig. 3) (Beischlag and Perdew, 2005; Beischlag et al., 2004; Petrulis and Perdew, 2002 ). The rapid effects of dioxins, such as TCDD-induced inflammation appear to stem from its non-genomic action involving ligand activated AhR causing rapid rise in intracellular Ca 2+ and activating protein kinases and phosphatases, for example epidermal growth factor receptor (Matsumura, 2009 ). Besides, hijacking of AhR by dioxins disrupts the endogenous functions such as regulation of cell-cycle, hematopoietic cell populations, tumour suppression, aging, hypoxia, and circadian rhythms (Carlson and Perdew, 2002; Marlowe and Puga, 2005; Singh et al., 2009 ). Chronic exposure to dioxins has also been shown to cause reproductive toxicity (interfere with hormonal signalling, anti-estrogenic effects, vitamin A inhibition, thyroxin mimicry), neurotoxicity (endocrine-disrupting actions, neural-disrupting action), immunotoxicity (immune-suppression, promotes inflammatory responses), tumorigenesis promotion etc. (Kogevinas, 2001; Marshall and Kerkvliet, 2010 ).\n3.3. Health consequences of e-waste exposure\nThe health impact of e-waste exposure on humans has been mainly assessed through evaluating exposure and effect biomarkers, and analysis of morbidity pattern among exposed and control populations. A comprehensive account of the health implications of exposure to various toxicants associated with e-waste recycling has been provided by Grant et al. in a systematic review (Grant et al., 2013 ). Through assessing levels of e-waste pollutants and their derivatives in serum, blood, cord-blood, placenta, meconium etc., it has been suggested that exposure to e-waste toxicants may affect thyroid function (as evident by altered levels of serum thyroid stimulating hormone, tri-iodothyronine and tetra-iodothyronine in the exposed group), cause genotoxicity (higher DNA damage, increased micronuclei frequency and chromosomal aberrations), alter cellular expression and function (altered expression levels of metallothionein, S100 P and S110 P proteins), neonatal outcomes (low birth-weight, birth-length, gestational age, Apgar score and body-mass index), physical growth and cognitive functions (low weight, height, body-mass index and intelligence quotient), temperament and behaviour (behavioural neurological assessment score and temperament score), and lung function (low forced vital capacity) (Table 2 ).\nTable 2.

E-waste recycling methods\nIn the modern era of rapid technological advances, a large amount of e-waste has been accumulated from the increased production of EEE that turn to e-waste upon the end of its useful life. Effective strategies are required both at production stage and after-use for environmentally sound management of the e-waste. Recycling is a valuable tool to control the rising heaps of e-waste; however, sub-optimal practices of recycling are contributing to increase in the levels of toxic pollutants in the ecosystem. The current global trend in e-waste management (informal processing of 82.6 % of global e-waste in 2019) has become unsustainable, and requires multifaceted approach for a holistic solution. Better understanding of e-waste collection and recycling process is an important link in this direction. This section discusses in brief the formal methods of e-waste collection and processes for recovery of valuable metals from e-waste.\nE-waste recycling comprises (i) collection of e-waste, (ii) its processing, and (iii) recovery of valuable materials (Meskers et al., 2009 ). Collection and consolidation of the obsolete EEE is an important step that requires both public awareness as well as establishments in form of regulatory agreements, government policies and accessible collection facilities to facilitate efficient collection of household or institutional e-waste. Under formal collection, the e-waste is collected by government authorized organizations, and/or producers via municipal collection points, pick-up services, and retailers. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) norm, a take-back initiative put in place by various nations places the responsibility on the original equipment manufacturers to collect certain fraction of their sales.\nEnrichment of valuable metals through removal of non-essential and non-recyclable fractions is the next step in recycling e-waste. It involves dismantling of the EEE to collect individual components. An e-waste, depending upon the type, manufacturer and the age of the equipment carries varying quantity of ferrous components (e.g. iron, steel), non-ferrous metals (e.g. silver, gold, copper, aluminium, platinum), plastics, glass, wood, rubber and other materials. These components are sorted to different batches of metals, plastics, ceramics, paper, wood and categories like capacitors, batteries, LCDs, PCBs to shred them into further small pieces (e.g. 0.177 mm to 5 cm) using mechanical processes (Cui and Forssberg, 2003 ). Industrial scale granulation machines are used for these purposes (Fig. 4 ). The processed e-waste is enriched for recovery by finally separating them into metallic and non-metallic fractions using magnetic, current-based, or density separation techniques (Li et al., 2007; Zhang and Forssberg, 1997 ).The plastic part of e-waste is mostly recycled as energy source, and to convert into plastic bottles.\nDownload : Download high-res image (1MB)\nDownload : Download full-size image\nFig. 4.

(B) E-waste fractions of various sizes. Images reproduced with permission from (Sarvar et al., 2015 ).\nMetals from the processed e-waste are recovered using hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical methods. The hydrometallurgical methods of metal recovery from e-waste use solvent extraction, leaching, adsorption and ion exchange processes for selective dissolution of precious metals, and recovery through electro refining or chemical reduction process (Ritcey, 2006; Sadegh Safarzadeh et al., 2007 ). Various mineral acids and oxidants including aqua-regia (3HCl:HNO 3 ), HCl, H 2 SO 4, HNO 3 /H 2 O 2, HClO 4, NaClO and lixiviants including cyanide, thiosulfate, thiourea and halide have been used for the recovery of pure base and precious metals from e-waste (Ding et al., 2019; Islam et al., 2020 ). Hydrometallurgical processes use toxic, highly acidic/alkaline, or flammable reagents and also generate voluminous solid wastes and effluents. Hydrometallurgy require off-gas treatment as the halogenated flame retardants used in printed circuit boards forms toxic dioxin, furans and volatile metals (Hageluken, 2006 ). However, it is not possible to achieve simultaneously both the inexpensive extraction and minimal emission of toxic components into the environment along with high extraction efficiency, and recyclability using any single process. Methods such as landfilling and incineration are used for treatment of effluent and other dangerous waste to minimize environmental contamination from disposed waste.\nPyrometallurgical methods of metal reclamation from e-waste involves thermal treatment of e-waste through conflagration, smelting in furnaces or alkali chemicals, drossing, sintering, plasma melting and other solid-liquid-gas reactions at high temperature for recovery of valuable metals (Antrekowitsch et al., 2006; Cui and Zhang, 2008; Ding et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019 ). Majority of e-waste recycling especially for Pb, Cu, and precious metals at industrial scale is performed using pyrometallurgic methods in Cu and Pb smelters (Antrekowitsch et al., 2006 ). These methods rely on chemical and metallurgic proportion of metals to segregate them pinto solvent metal phase (molten bath) for partial or full recovery through subsequent hydrometallurgical, electrochemical techniques. Mostly, copper smelters are used for these purposes. Separated precious metals as anode slimes are recovered through electro- or hydro-metallurgical process. Non-recyclable materials like plastics are used as energy sources (Cui and Zhang, 2008; van Schaik and Reuter, 2014 ). Pyrometallurgy methods are often used for initial segregation and upgrading of precious metals into base metals followed by hydrometallurgical and electrometallurgical process for the recovery of pure base and precious metals. For example, recovery of platinum group metals [e.g., Ruthenium (Ru), Rhodium (Rh), Platinum (Pt), and Palladium (Pd)] from e-waste uses a combination of hydro-, pyro- and electro- metallurgical process. Leaching into acids and separation from model solution using liquid-liquid extraction through precipitation with phosphonium quaternary salts and pH change, and ionic liquids have been reported for Pd, Pt, Ru and Rh metals (Mohdee et al., 2018; Rzelewska-Piekut and Regel-Rosocka, 2019 ). Similarly, extraction of gold (Au) by leaching it into lixiviates like thiourea, cyanide, halide or thiosulfate and separation through resin-based adsorption (1-ehylenediamine and 1-(2-aminoethyl) piperazine resins), or with aqueous polyethylene glycol-(NH 4)2 SO 4 two-phase system have been reported (Bulgariu and Bulgariu, 2011; Cyganowski et al., 2017 ). Further details on sustainable approaches to recover precious metals from e-waste using various chemical and biological processes have been discussed elsewhere (Ding et al., 2019; Islam et al., 2020; Khaliq et al., 2014 ).\n5. Challenges and opportunities associated with e-waste management\nMetals, plastics, glass, and rare earth elements present in e-waste are valuable secondary resources. The richness of e-waste for valuable elements can be understood by estimates that suggest a typical cathode-ray tube TV carry approximately 450 g Cu, 227 g Al and 5.6 g Au (Zeng et al., 2018 ). Similarly, a metric ton of waste personal computers may generate more gold than that recovered from 17 metric ton of gold ore (Bleiwas and Kelly, 2001 ). The conventional e-waste recycling activities have, however, targeted mainly for recovering useful and easily extractable materials such as metals that are present in relatively high content and extractable forms (Baccini and Brunner, 2012 ). Notwithstanding the challenges in effective e-waste management, recycling e-waste have benefitted both the environment and human health (Table 3 ).\nTable 3.

Major challenges in effective management of e-waste\nElectronic components such as printed circuit boards, graphic and memory cards, hard drives, and cables and connector which are commonly used in gadgets like personal computers and smartphones have been the preferred sources for extraction of precious and rare earth metals (Bleiwas and Kelly, 2001 ). However, e-waste is not only a source of valuable materials, but also of a variety of toxic chemicals emitted during its processing and recycling. For instance, hazardous substances present in e-waste (Pb, Hg, As, Cd, PCBs; primary emission), or those produced as by-products during processing and recycling (dioxins and furans, PAHs; secondary emission) are of great concern for environment as well as human health (Orlins and Guan, 2016 ). A holistic approach that encompasses collection of all categories of e-waste upon end of useful life and recycle them entirely, so that no materials get wasted, is required for sustainable e-waste management (Reuter et al., 2013; Song et al., 2015 ).\nThe main challenge for managing e-waste is its massively high volume and complexity. As presented in Fig. 1, e-waste generation is increasing constantly with an estimated rate of 2 Mt annually, where China, USA, India, Japan, and Brazil together generated 50 % of the total e-waste in 2019 (Forti et al., 2020 ). Escalating e-waste amount is a serious concern in countries such as China and India which are leading e-waste generators as well as importers of e-waste from across the world (Wang et al., 2016 ). Compounded with the difficulty in separating e-waste components (i.e., some components may be bolted, others screwed, snapped, glued or soldered together), the household tendency to dispose all categories of e-waste together make it further difficult to segregate e-waste components into multiple categories such as metals, plastics, and glasses for their effective product-specific recycling (Chi et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017 ).\nLack of environmental awareness and knowledge on e-waste disposal and collection options among households due to insufficient efforts taken by local governments to popularize e-waste recycling policies and collection strategies after implementation of relevant legislation constrain the households to either sell e-waste to peddlers or itinerant collectors, or dump as solid waste (Wang et al., 2017 ). Further, the lack of effective collection mechanisms and networks has promoted informal setups that could recycle only selective e-waste materials due to lack of infrastructure and technology-driven methods. As a result, high volume of valuable secondary resource is either lost, and/or multiple toxic materials from primary, secondary and tertiary emissions are released into the environment.\nLack of financial support to highly automated and technically sound formal sectors to meet high running costs for systematic e-waste collection and treatment, site rent and skilled manpower costs have restricted the role of formal systems vis-a-vis the informal sector in e-waste recycling (Lundgren, 2012 ). Hence, a major fraction of the e-waste is handled by informal sector at inappropriate setups which lack basic infrastructure and technology to recover all the valuable substances and are usually not able to put in place measures to prevent the escape of pollutants into the environment. The crude recycling methods adopted by informal sectors are expected to release toxic additives and hazardous substances contained or produced from e-waste treatment into the environment, posing significant threat to the environment and human health. Further, prevalence of extensive manual dismantling, for example, use of hammers, chisels and screw drivers operated with bare hands to dismantle and separate e-waste components (Puckett et al., 2002, Wen et al., 2006), and recovering metals from cables, printed circuit boards and other components via heating over coal-fired grills, burning in open air, or stripping in open-pit acid baths are key constraints to effective management of e-waste (Awasthi and Li, 2017; Chi et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2007 ).\n5.2. Key opportunities in effective e-waste management\nDespite many challenges, e-waste recycling offers multiple opportunities owing to its huge richness of resources and its role in limiting the pace of e-waste generation. The most remarkable benefit of a systematically managed e-waste recycling is that it provides a controlled processing system for the e-waste that would otherwise end up in landfills or incinerator contaminating the environment (Song et al., 2015; Widmer et al., 2005 ). This way, it loops the conventional linear approach of resource extraction and helps in retaining materials in use for a longer time (Fig. 5 ). This reduces waste generation and promotes use of secondary raw materials in production through material recycling (Cossu et al., 2012; Klinglmair and Fellner, 2010 ).\nDownload : Download high-res image (171KB)\nDownload : Download full-size image\nFig. 5. Circular economic model of EEE lifecycle. (1) The typical linear economic model of EEE lifecycle involves its manufacturing and sale (production), consumption and waste generation (usage), and discards upon end-of-life. (2) e-waste recycling loops the conventional “take-make-dispose” approach, by recollecting the discarded WEEE, recovering valuable elements from it, and providing it as secondary raw material for use in production.\nVarious environmental and societal benefits are accrued by keeping the hazardous waste away from the landfills and reducing greenhouse gases emission and carbon footprint through decline in demand for new metal products (Debnath et al., 2015 ). Also, extracting raw materials from e-waste reduces the volumes of disposed waste, and the non-recyclable components can be used as fuels in industrial manufacturing to provide significant energy savings.\nA huge economic component is attached with e-waste recycling. For instance, the cost of raw materials present in 53.6 Mt e-waste generated in 2019 is estimated to 57 billion USD (Forti et al., 2020 ). Thus, by strengthening collection and recycling of e-waste, the developing economies, which rely on import for several vital minerals including the copper, cobalt and nickel, can restrict the over-extraction and over-dependence on imports through e-waste reclamation and endure stability against price hikes, monopolistic and strategic behaviour by exporters. The potential of creation of additional jobs is another economic aspect of e-waste recycling industry.\nBesides, one of the largest benefits that can be drawn from e-waste recycling is the reduced need of virgin mining for the extractable metals (Zeng et al., 2018 ). It is estimated that the stock of iron and copper iron in the geologic stores has almost depleted to its half. Hence, an immediate shift to large-scale resource recovery is required to preserve the remaining natural resources (Krook and Baas, 2013 ). Also, owing to the increasing global demand and declining ore grades, excavation of fine-grained and more complex ore deposits is required that can be compensated, at least to some extent, through e-waste recycling as the concentration and average grade of metals in the e-waste are usually higher than that of an ore extracted from mines (Zeng et al., 2018 ). Further, the environmental escape of toxic components of e-waste upon natural decomposition or through inappropriate disposal could be restricted through an automated e-waste recycling. This can reduce all major types of pollution associated with it and prevent the susceptible population from being exposed to hazardous e-waste pollutants.\n6. Strategies for effective and environmentally safe e-waste management\nThe amount of e-waste generated around the global is continuously growing at substantial rate. While on the one hand, improper e-waste recycling without adequate safeguards can potentially threaten human health, on the other, it also provides livelihoods to countless poor workers, particularly in the developing countries. Hence, aiming to manage e-waste menace by just implementing legislative laws and empanelling channels for its organised recycling may not be sufficient. Collaborative efforts through mass awareness on harms and benefits of e-waste recycling, strengthening formal sectors, ensuring compliance to EPR and e-waste management norms, advancing product design, deriving engineering solutions, and strengthening the knowledge regarding adverse health effects through focused research are required to address the concerns associated with e-waste recycling. Some of such aspects are discussed in the succeeding paragraphs.\n6.1. Improving the efficiency of e-waste recycling\nRate of e-waste collection through organized channels is very low, mainly due to lack of awareness regarding benefits and harms of e-waste recycling among consumers, as well as absence of provisions for economic incentives such as free collection, transportation and exchange benefits. Working upon these aspects would help in attracting customers to join recycling initiatives. Informal e-waste recycling, which also plays a pivotal role in solid waste management in many developing countries is also considered as environmental and occupational health hazard. Informal sectors are usually less-expensive to build and run, and have empirical know-how on e-waste disposal patterns of a city. Availability of relatively cheaper labour allows cost-effective manual collection and processing of large quantities of e-waste often with minimal infrastructure and investment. However, informal e-waste recyclers are often able to recover only selected materials of economic value (e.g., gold, silver) from some of the highly enriched sources (e.g., PCB) using improvised methods often releasing the un-extracted elements and generated pollutants in the environment. For reducing the occupational and environmental hazards from such collection and processing activity, it is necessary to bring such itinerant e-waste collectors and small-scale recyclers into the organized or a co-operative domain and ensure remunerative returns for their work. Linking the two actors (formal and informal sectors) through community-based organisation (CBO) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) can be one of the viable models to promote efficient e-waste recycling (Baud et al., 2001; Henzler et al., 2017; StEP, 2020 ). For instance, the informal recyclers can be assigned with activities such as waste collection, disassembly, and segregation tasks, while allocating the deep recovery – the most concerning part in entire e-waste recycling process to the state-of–the art e-waste processing refineries. Since a major fraction of e-waste by weight comprises metal, glass and plastics which can be processed manually without causing significant environmental damage. The other constituents of e-waste that contain hazardous substances and would require appropriate facility and infrastructure for recycling may be sold to the authorised recyclers having access to advanced e-waste processing sectors. The informal operators may be provided appropriate remuneration for the e-waste collection, disassembly, and sorting activities. Multiple case studies have attempted to evaluate the effects of partnering the formal and informal sectors in e-waste recycling. In India, Green E-waste Recyclers, SWaCH, Saahas Zero Waste, E-WarDD, GIZ-Microsoft and Chintan collection and recycling companies have conducted case studies based on the intervention model as shown in Fig. 6 wherein the door-to-door collection of WEEE was predominantly maintained through informal sector workers, who were paid accordingly, and subsequent dismantling and recycling was carried out at these licensed recycling facilities (Henzler et al., 2017 ). These case studies elucidated the benefits of establishing partnership between the formal and informal sectors through trustworthy financial transactions to some extent. This mainstreaming of informal recyclers would expectedly reduce the unsafe recycling practices decreasing environmental pollution while enhancing overall recovery of useful material from e-waste.\nDownload : Download high-res image (334KB)\nDownload : Download full-size image\nFig. 6. Schematic illustration of the existing e-waste recycling system (A) and the one proposed for informal-formal sector partnerships (B).\nThe informal sector usually collects the consumer discarded WEEE through itinerant collectors, scrap dealers and illegal e-waste traders and perform manual dismantling and recycling at small-scale units using inferior methods. On the other hand, the formal sectors often collect WEEE through take-back system via dealers/retailers and channel it to licensed recyclers for mechanical dismantling and controlled processing for metal extraction. The proposed model of informal-formal partnerships excludes informal recyclers while engaging informal collectors into the mainstream (Fig. 6 ).\n6.2. Sustainable production: changes to design and manufacturing process of electronic and electrical items to enable improved recycling\nAdvancing product design is another way to minimize generation of waste and related health issues. Proper control over the material chemistry and quality of the raw materials used in the manufacturing of electronic and electrical equipment can substantially reduce the need of raw materials and the quantity of hazardous waste generated upon the end-of-life of the products. The current trend in electronic markets that favour light weight, slim, and highly compact electronic gadgets also make it difficult to repair these gadgets due to miniaturization constraints. However, just as the display quality and size, processor speed and energy efficiency are marketing features for these modern electronic gadgets, recyclability should also increasingly be a priority for device manufacturers. Designing products for easier disassembly by minimizing the use of glue and thermally setting screws in plastic can be one way of boosting easier and efficient recycling. Producing sustainable devices that do not get obsolete too soon or have considerable long-life can be another way to deal with overproduction of EEE and subsequent generation of e-waste. Partnering industrialists with engineers, scientists, and e-waste recycling experts can help achieving such visions.\n6.3. Sustainable recycling: adopting recycling methods releasing minimal toxicants\nThe traditional methods of recovering precious metals form e-waste using pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy often releases dangerous toxicants such as dioxins and acidic lixiviates which adversely impact the environment and human health. Developing alternative methods of metal recovery from e-waste, such as use of less toxic chemicals, e.g. thiosulfate instead of cyanide for Au extraction, or bioleaching using extremophilic microorganisms is one promising way to safer recycling of e-waste. Several microorganisms including bacteria (Acidithiobacillus caldus, A. thiooxidans, Pseudomonas balearica, P. ﬂuorescens) and fungi (Aspergillus niger, A. ferrooxidans, Purpureocillium lilacinum) have been reported for recovery of precious metals (Ag, Au, Co, Pd, Pt) as well as base metals (Cu, Ni, Fe, Zn) from e-waste (Table S4) (Islam et al., 2020 ). As the reported bioleaching methods are less efficient and require long bioleaching time, improvement in these two aspects through optimized microbial consortia is required.\n6.4. Reducing occupational health hazards for workers engaged in e-waste recycling\nWearing personal facemasks may provide an immediate and short-term solution to those who seek to reduce their exposure to high levels of pollutants released in the workplace where e-waste recycling takes place. Cloth masks made of synthetic or natural cloth material worn across the mouth and nose had been a popular choice in developing countries due to its inexpensive nature and reusability. However, these masks though useful in reducing exposure to coarser particles (e.g. PM 10 ), are only marginally beneficial in protecting against PM 2.5 and finer particles which may be released during e-waste recycling, for which N95 masks are required.\n6.5. Stringent e-waste recycling norms\nIn many countries, norms for e-waste recycling are either not in conformity with the changing times or are not enforced properly. However, considering that improper e-waste recycling in informal sectors poses significant burden to environmental and occupational health, there is a need to align norms and legislation with the changing nature of electronic and electrical equipment and the growing body of scientific literature. Besides, policies should be designed to facilitate research and development for improving e-waste processing technology so as to reduce the production and emission of toxic substances during e-waste recycling. Further, the norms and regulations should facilitate reuse of electronic and electrical equipment and minimisation of e-waste generation. With a greater focus on the quality of goods in the production phase, technical, and economic responsibility should increasingly be transferred from the Consumer to the Producer. Besides, production of hazardous substances during recycling and their safe disposal in recycled materials should also be regulated stringently. Moreover, norms and regulations for e-waste recycling should be enforced properly to ensure that environmental pollution and health effects on the people involved in the e-waste recycling process are reduced to minimum. Methods to assess the trans-boundary movement (import and export) of e-waste are needed, particularly as a part of trade codes between the countries. Methods such as placing GPS trackers in e-waste, deputing a researcher called “Person in the Port” at import port, or tagging a price threshold to shipment carrying e-waste have been used to monitor trans-boundary movement of e-waste (Balde et al., 2017 ).\n7. Conclusion\nIn this age of information and communication technology, electronic and electrical devices have become almost indispensable. Owing to the fast-developing nature of the technology, many such devices become obsolete within a few years of their production. These factors, along with the growth in demand due to increasing purchasing power of people across the world, lead to the generation of enormous quantities of e-waste. While e-waste recycling is being carried out in many parts of the world to recover valuable materials present in e-waste, there are several concerns associated with it. In the developing world, which is the largest generator as well as the recycler of e-waste, a vast majority of such recycling units are in the informal sectors that usually lack advanced technology for e-waste recycling and are not able to take effective measures for mitigating environmental pollution associated with inefficient e-waste recycling. Moreover, even e-waste recycling in the organized sector poses several environmental and occupational health hazards which also partly stems from the fact that e-waste recycling technologies have not kept pace with the technological advancements in the field of production of electronic and electrical equipment.\nImproved understanding of the challenges associated with implementing effective e-waste management practices, the pollutant emission patterns associated with various methods of extracting valuable minerals from e-waste, the major exposure routes and toxicological mechanism of various pollutants emitted during e-waste recycling can potentially help in devising strategies for mitigating environmental and health issues associated with e-waste recycling. Further, to effectively harness the opportunity associated with efficient e-waste management, a few additional approaches and strategies that may optimize the process of e-waste recycling should be considered. Such strategies may include: enforcing norms and regulations which are designed on the basis of scientific evidence; supporting the informal sector to ensure that the e-waste recycling norms are adhered to; and segregation of activities by the creation of a value chain wherein the less-sophisticated activities like collection and segregation of e-waste are entrusted to the unorganized sector whereas e-waste processing and recovery of the valuable components are carried out by the organized sector. Adopting sustainable methods of recycling, such as use of diverse group of microorganisms like chemolithotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria (e.g. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, Klebsiella pneumonia, Streptomyces erythraeus ), fungi (e.g. Aspergilllus niger or Aspergillus nomius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cladosporium cladosporioides) and algae (e.g. Chorella vulgaris) for bioleaching of metals from e-waste and its recovery through biosorption can potentially overcome the issue of release of dangerous dioxins gases from traditional pyrometallurgy process or release of toxic acids. Besides, the production process should also be tweaked so that the recycling factor is also taken into account while designing and manufacturing the devices. Finally, there is an urgent need to develop novel technologies so as to facilitate efficient and safe e-waste recycling (Fig. 7 ). Advancing the bioleaching processes via developing microbial consortia for improved and efficient leaching of valuable metals from e-waste needs further research. It is hoped that the implementation of these solutions, taken together, should reduce the environmental and health hazards posed by inefficient and improper recycling of new generation of e-waste and should help in effective recovery of the valuable materials from the e-waste.\nDownload : Download high-res image (246KB)\nDownload : Download full-size image\nFig. 7. Schematic representation of a sustainable e-waste management model. A sustainable e-waste management system can be designed via promoting (i) sustainable production which has low carbon footprint, and the products are amenable to easier recycling; (ii) sustainable use of the products via extending the useful life of the product and developing platforms through which the devices can be shared; and (iii) efficient recycling with minimal environmental and health impacts.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nAuthors declare no conflict of interest.

These items create unique challenges for traditional disposal workflows and consequently, put more pressure on the environment and consumers.\nThe solution to making e-waste less of a problem is properly recycling it.\nAre you curious to know exactly why properly disposing of e-waste is so important? If you are, keep reading to become a more conscious consumer!\nThere Are Valuable Materials in E-Waste\nMost of us don’t think twice when we see a cellphone battery, a solar panel, or any other form of modern technology. That’s because consumers are insulated from the process that’s required to gather everything that goes into those items.\nNot only are several materials electronics leverage hard to find but many are finite.  By recycling e-waste, you allow companies to retrieve these precious substances which can then be reused.\nThat dampens the impact that sourcing materials has on the earth and preserves the often poor communities where sourcing operations take place.\nE-Waste Can Be Toxic\nDo you know what makes a battery work? Substances like acid, lead, nickel, lithium, and mercury.\nOne thing that those elements have in common is that they can be poisonous and wreak havoc on the environment. When batteries are recycled properly, they’re disposed of in a way that keeps them from leaking harmful substances or creating noxious fumes as they deteriorate.\nPoisoning the Third World\nMost communities in first-world countries don’t want to be confronted with the impact of their waste. That has made it popular for junk to be shipped overseas.\nYou might ask yourself which countries would take our junk off our hands? Oftentimes, the answer to that question is the countries that are the poorest.\nResource-poor countries cut deals with rich countries to store their garbage on their shores. While that’s an issue that goes beyond the scope of this post, by ensuring that your electronics are not caught up in those shipments, you can reduce the impact you have on the developing world’s environment.\nPrivacy Risks\nWhen your computer, tablet, or phone stops working, that doesn’t mean that your data on those devices disappears. In most cases, the hard drive in a dysfunctional electronic is fully operational.\nSo, imagine if you were to throw your phone in the garbage and someone later found your device and recovered the files on your drive.\nWould you be comfortable with that person having access to all of your pictures, downloaded emails, and notes? If you answered no to that question, you’re better off properly recycling your e-waste.\nRecycling centers will properly destroy devices and their drives as soon as recyclable materials are recovered.\nLower Prices\nCan you guess where recycled materials from e-waste go after they’re pulled from your trashed devices? Oftentimes, those resources are purchased by manufacturers who then put them into new merchandise.\nIt’s cheaper for manufacturers to source recycled resources than it is for them to source resources from the earth. Those lower costs mean lower prices for consumers which can save you money when you go to buy your next gadget.\nLess Pressure on Landfills\nWhile US landfills still have the capacity for garbage, given the alarming rate at which we produce trash, the concern of one day running out of space is real. Recycling e-waste helps avoid that issue for a little bit longer since e-waste that’s mined for materials will take up less room in landfills than they would if they had been thrown away whole.\nWhile that might not mean much in the context of a single laptop, if you multiply space savings across millions of devices trashed every year, recycling saves an uncountable amount of landfill volume.\nSupporting Better Recycling Processes\nE-waste recycling companies make money off of the work they do mining materials from electronics. The more profitable these businesses are, the more they’ll invest in increasing the efficacy of recycling workflows.\nA simple way to invest in recycling’s continued momentum is by recycling!\nAs more electronics flow through e-waste collection agencies, money and innovation will follow.\nLegal Ramifications\nIn case there weren’t enough social reasons to recycle e-waste, here’s a legal one that may be of inspiration to you. Some states target businesses that do not dispose of their electronics properly by hitting them with steep fines.\nYou can learn about the state of California’s existing regulations here as an example of what strict disposal laws look like. You can also explore more state’s rules online or by talking to a business attorney in the state you’re interested in.\nE-Waste Is Everyone’s Responsibility\nWe’ve heard time and again people doubt the impact that a single computer monitor or microwave is going to have on the environment. That attitude multiplied across millions of people is why we have the e-waste problems we’re managing today.\nAlways take personal accountability for your junk and remember that it’s everyone’s obligation to help keep our planet sustainable. Doing something as simple as putting your laptop in a proper electronic waste disposal bin is a big win for the world.\nCurious to know more about the environment?

There is global inconsistency in the under-standing and application of the term “e-waste” in both legislation and everyday use. This has resulted in many definitions contained within e-waste regulations, policies and guidelines. The intent of this paper is to provide a non-legal definition of the term and clarity about how the term should be used.\nE-waste is one of the fastest growing waste streams globally. The UNU ADDRESS project documents that e-waste volume placed on the market since 1990 has grown from 19.5 million tonnes to 57.4 million tonnes in 2010 and is set to more than tri-ple to approximately 75 million tonnes by 2015.\nE-waste contains hazardous substances that, if treated inappropriately at end-of-life, can damage human health and the environment. It also contains complex valuable materials, such as precious metals which need to be treated properly to effectively recover them with minimal environmental impact.\nOverview:\nIndustrial revolution followed by the advances in information technology during the last century has radically changed people’s lifestyle. Although this development has helped the human race, mismanagement has led to new problems of contamination and pollution. The technical prowess acquired during the last century has posed a new challenge in the management of wastes. For example, personal computers (PCs) contain certain components, which are highly toxic, such as chlorinated and brominated substances, toxic gases, toxic metals, biologically active materials, acids, plastics and plastic additives.The hazardous content of these materials pose a environmental and health threat. Thus proper management is necessary while disposing or recycling e­wastes.\nThese days computer has become most common and widely used gadget in all kinds of activities ranging from schools, residences, offices to manufacturing industries. E-toxic components in computers could be summarized as circuit boards containing heavy metals like lead & cadmium; batteries containing cadmium; cathode ray tubes with lead oxide & barium; brominated flame retardants used on printed circuit boards, cables and plastic casing; poly vinyl chloride (PVC) coated copper cables and plastic computer casings that release highly toxic dioxins & furans when burnt to recover valuable metals; mercury switches; mercury in flat screens; poly chlorinated biphenyl’s (PCB’s) present in older capacitors; transformers; etc. Basel Action Network (BAN) estimates that the 500 million computers in the world contain 2.87 billion kgs of plastics, 716.7 million kgs of lead and 286,700 kgs of mercury. The average 14-inch monitor uses a tube that contains an estimated 2.5 to 4 kgs of lead. The lead can seep into the ground water from landfills thereby contaminating it. If the tube is crushed and burned, it emits toxic fumes into the air.\nDefinition of E-waste:\nThe term “e-waste” itself is self-explanatory, in the sense that it is an abbreviation of “electronic waste”. A key part of the definition is the word “waste” and what it logically implies – that the item has no further use and is rejected as useless or excess to the owner in its current condition. The definition of e-waste that has been agreed by Step is:\n“E-Waste is a term used to cover items of all types of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and its parts that have been discarded by the owner as waste without the intention of re-use.”\nIt is important to note that the definition includes all types of EEE, as there is no room for regional variance or preference in a global definition; the fact that the item in question meets the definition “ with circuitry or electrical components with power or battery supply ”qualifies it for inclusion.\nThe inclusion of “parts” within the definition refers to parts that have been removed from EEE by disassembly and are electrical or electronic in nature.\nThe use of the term “discarded” is also central to this definition, meaning to throw away5 or get rid of as useless6. The term implies that the item in question is considered excess or waste by the owner. It is the critical point at which the potential nature of the item changes from a useful product to that of waste.\nEffects on environment and human health:\n“E-waste” is a popular, informal name for electronic products nearing the end of their “useful life. “E-wastes are considered dangerous, as certain components of some electronic products contain materials that are hazardous, depending on their condition and density. The hazardous content of these materials pose a threat to human health and environment.Discarded\nComputer,\ntelevisions\nVCRs\nstereos,\ncopiers\nfax machines,\nelectric lamps,\ncell phones,\naudio equipment and batteries\nif improperly disposed can leach lead and other substances into soil and groundwater. Many of these products can be reused, refurbished, or recycled in an environmentally sound manner so that they are less harmful to the ecosystem.\nDisposal of e-wastes is a particular problem faced in many regions across the globe. Computer wastes that are landfilled produces contaminated leachates which eventually pollute the groundwater. Acids and sludge obtained from melting computer chips, if disposed on the ground causes acidification of soil. For example, Guiyu, Hong Kong a thriving area of illegal e-waste recycling is facing acute water shortages due to the contamination of water resources.\nThis is due to disposal of recycling wastes such as acids, sludges etc. in rivers. Now water is being transported from faraway towns to cater to the demands of the population. Incineration of e-wastes can emit toxic fumes and gases, thereby polluting the surrounding air. Improperly monitored landfills can cause environmental hazards. Mercury will leach when certain electronic devices, such as circuit breakers are destroyed.The same is true for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from condensers. When brominated flame retardant plastic or cadmium containing plastics are landfilled, both polybrominated dlphenyl ethers (PBDE) and cadmium may leach into the soil and groundwater. It has been found that significant amounts of lead ion are dissolved from broken lead containing glass, such as the cone glass of cathode ray tubes, gets mixed with acid waters and are a common occurrence in landfills.\nNot only does the leaching of mercury poses specific problems, the vaporization of metallic mercury and dimethylene mercury, both part of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is also of concern. In addition, uncontrolled fires may arise at landfills and this could be a frequent occurrence in many countries. When exposed to fire, metals and other chemical substances, such as the extremely toxic dioxins and furans (TCDD tetrachloro dibenzo-dioxin, PCDDs-polychlorinated dibenzo­dioxins. PBDDs-polybrominated dibenzo-dioxin and PCDFs­poly chlorinated dibenzo furans) from halogenated flame retardant products and PCB containing condensers can be emitted. The most dangerous form of burning e-waste is the open-air burning of plastics in order to recover copper and other metals. The toxic fall-out from open air burning affects both the local environment and broader global air currents, depositing highly toxic by products in many places throughout the world.\nTable I summarizes the health effects of certain constituents in e-wastes. If these electronic items are discarded with other household garbage, the toxic pose a threat to both health and vital components of the ecosystem. In view of the ill-effects of hazardous wastes to both environment and health, several countries exhorted the need for a global agreement to address the problems and challenges posed by hazardous waste.\nResponsibility and Role of industries:\n1. Generators of wastes should take responsibility to determine the output characteristics of wastes and if hazardous, should provide management options.\n2. All personnel involved in handling e-waste in industries including those at the policy, management, control and operational levels, should be properly qualified and trained. Companies can adopt their own policies while handling.\ne-wastes. Some are given below:\nUse label materials to assist in recycling (particularly plastics).\nStandardize components for easy disassembly.\nRe-evaluate ‘cheap products’ use, make product cycle ‘cheap’ and so that it\nhas no inherent value that would encourage a recycling infrastructure.\nCreate computer components and peripherals of biodegradable materials.\nUtilize technology sharing particularly for manufacturing and de manufacturing.\nEncourage / promote / require green procurement for corporate buyers.\nLook at green packaging options.\n3. Companies can and should adopt waste minimization techniques, which will make a significant reduction in the quantity of e-waste generated and thereby lessening the impact on the environment. It is a “reverse production” system that designs infrastructure to recover and reuse every material contained within e-wastes metals such as lead, copper, aluminum and gold, and various plastics, glass and wire. Such a “closed loop” manufacturing and recovery system offers a win-win situation for everyone, less of the Earth will be mined for raw materials, and groundwater will be protected, researchers explain.\n4. Manufacturers, distributors, and retailers should undertake the responsibility of recycling/disposal of their own products.\n5. Manufacturers of computer monitors, television sets and other electronic devices containing hazardous materials must be responsible for educating consumers and the general public regarding the potential threat to public health and the environment posed by their products. At minimum, all computer monitors, television sets and other electronic devices containing hazardous materials must be clearly labeled to identify environmental hazards and proper materials management.\nManagement of E-Wastes:\nIt is estimated that 75% of electronic items are stored due to uncertainty of how to manage it. These electronic junks lie unattended in houses, offices,warehouses etc.and normally mixed with household wastes, which are finally disposed off at landfills. This necessitates implementable management measures.\nIn industries management of e-waste should begin at the point of generation. This can be done by waste minimization techniques and by sustainable product design. Waste minimization in industries involves adopting:\ninventory management,\nproduction-process modification,\nvolume reduction,\nrecovery and reuse.\nInventory management:\nProper control over the materials used in the manufacturing process is an important way to reduce waste generation (Freeman, 1989). By reducing both the quantity of hazardous materials used in the process and the amount of excess raw materials in stock, the quantity of waste generated can be reduced. This can be done in two ways i.e. establishing material-purchase review and control procedures and inventory tracking system.\nDeveloping review procedures for all material purchased is the first step in establishing an inventory management program. Procedures should require that all materials be approved prior to purchase. In the approval process all production materials are evaluated to examine if they contain hazardous constituents and whether alternative non-hazardous materials are available.\nAnother inventory management procedure for waste reduction is to ensure that only the needed quantity of a material is ordered. This will require the establishment of a strict inventory tracking system. Purchase procedures must be implemented which ensure that materials are ordered only on an as-needed basis and that only the amount needed for a specific period of time is ordered.\nProduction-process modification:\nChanges can be made in the production process, which will reduce waste generation. This reduction can be accomplished by changing the materials used to make the product or by the more efficient use of input materials in the production process or both. Potential waste minimization techniques can be broken down into three categories:\ni) Improved operating and maintenance procedures,\nii) Material change and\niii)Process-equipment modification.\nImprovements in the operation and maintenance of process equipment can result in significant waste reduction. This can be accomplished by reviewing current operational procedures or lack of procedures and examination of the production process for ways to improve its efficiency. Instituting standard operation procedures can optimize the use of raw materials in the production process and reduce the potential for materials to be lost through leaks and spills. A strict maintenance program, which stresses corrective maintenance, can reduce waste generation caused by equipment failure. An employee-training program is a key element of any waste reduction program.\nTraining should include correct operating and handling procedures, proper equipment use, recommend maintenance and inspection schedules, correct process control specifications and proper management of waste materials.\nHazardous materials used in either a product formulation or a production process may be replaced with a less hazardous or non-hazardous material. This is a very widely used technique and is applicable to most manufacturing processes. Implementation of this waste ­reduction technique may require only some minor process adjustments or it may require extensive new process equipment. For example, a circuit board manufacturer can replace solvent-based product with water-based flux and simultaneously replace solvent vapor degreaser with detergent parts washer.\nVolume reduction:\nVolume reduction includes those techniques that remove the hazardous portion of a waste from a non-hazardous portion. These techniques are usually to reduce the volume, and thus the cost of disposing of a waste material. The techniques that can be used to reduce waste-stream volume can be divided into 2 general categories: source segregation and waste concentration. Segregation of wastes is in many cases a simple and economical technique for waste reduction. Wastes containing different types of metals can be treated separately so that the metal value in the sludge can be recovered. Concentration of a waste stream may increase the likelihood that the material can be recycled or reused. Methods include gravity and vacuum filtration, ultra filtration, reverse osmosis, freeze vaporization etc.\nFor example, an electronic component manufacturer can use compaction equipments to reduce volume of waste cathode ray-tube.\nRecovery and reuse:\nThis technique could eliminate waste disposal costs, reduce raw material costs and provide income from a salable waste. Waste can be recovered on-site, or at an off-site recovery facility, or through inter industry exchange. A number of physical and chemical techniques are available to reclaim a waste material such as reverse osmosis, electrolysis, condensation, electrolytic recovery, filtration, centrifugation etc. For example, a printed-circuit board manufacturer can use electrolytic recovery to reclaim metals from copper and tin-lead plating bath.\nHowever recycling of hazardous products has little environmental benefit if it simply moves the hazards into secondary products that eventually have to be disposed of.Unless the goal is redesign the product to use non­hazardous materials, such recycling is a false solution.\nE -Waste-reduce, reuse, recycle:\nMillions of tons of electronic waste is generated every year in all over the world and the amount increases with every new gadget, computer and smartphone that hits the market. In our quest to improve our lives through technology we are creating electronic waste at an unprecedented rate. In response, we have seen more attention focused on methods to reduce, reuse and recycle electronic waste.\nE-waste is the most rapidly growing segment of the municipal solid waste stream.\nE-waste contains many valuable, recoverable materials such as aluminum, copper, gold, silver, plastics, and ferrous metals. In order to conserve natural resources and the energy needed to produce new electronic equipment from virgin resources, electronic equipment can be refurbished, reused, and recycled instead of being landfilled.\nE-waste also contains toxic and hazardous materials including mercury, lead, cadmium, beryllium, chromium, and chemical flame retardants, which have the potential to leach into our soil and water.\nWhat are the benefits and advantages of recycle e-waste?\nThere are several!\nConserves natural resources. Recycling recovers valuable materials from old electronics that can be used to make new products. As a result, we save energy, reduce pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and save resources by extracting fewer raw materials from the earth.\nProtects your surroundings. Safe recycling of outdated electronics promotes sound management of toxic chemicals such as lead and mercury.\nHelps others. Donating your used electronics benefits your community by passing on ready-to-use or refurbished equipment to those who need it.\nCreate Jobs. e-cycling creates jobs for professional recyclers and refurbishers and creates new markets for the valuable components that are dismantled.\nSaves landfill space. E-waste is a growing waste stream. By recycling these items, landfill space is conserved.\nElectronic waste management options hierarchy:\nReuse of whole units: Reuse functioning electronic equipment by donating it to someone who can still use it.\nRepair/refurbishment/remanufacturing of units\nRecovery/reuse of functional peripherals or components\nRecycling of constituent materials: Recycle those components that cannot be repaired.\nLast. Responsible disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste in permitted landfills.\nThink back ­for a minute at the procession of computers, TVs, cell phones, radios, game consoles and music players that have passed through your hands over the years. What about the endless stream of products such as vacuum cleaners, microwaves, hair dryers, electric toothbrushes, alarm clocks, lamps, lawn mowers and smoke detectors that have come in and out of your life?\nThese are just a few examples of devices that are part of the growing phenomenon known as e-waste. E-waste is the term used to describe discarded electronics and electrical products. In the past few decades, the world’s demand for gadgetry has gone through the roof and, inevitably, more waste has started to accumulate. As the bustling economies of China and India modernize and follow more Western trends, the worldwide generation of e-waste has hit astronomical proportions.\nSo what happens to all that e-waste? E-waste contains a bonanza of toxic and hazardous components that, for the most part, are currently being shunted into landfills. Much of the remaining portion is exported to developing nations, where many laborers, working under unsafe, unregulated conditions, recycle this e-waste. The work these laborers do, while it does provide some raw materials that can be reused, comes with some serious consequences.\nE-waste Regulations:\nIf you don’t want to damage the environment, are you supposed to transform your storage closet into an electronics graveyard? Never fear, the slow but steady mechanisms of social consciousness have been grinding at this one for a while now, and movement is starting to happen. Input about e-waste regulations are coming from a number of fronts, including grassroots organizations, governing bodies and industrial leaders.\nMany organizations have recognized the potential for e-waste dangers for years. However, the issue recently came to the forefront of media in 2002, when Basel Action Network’s (BAN) documentary “Exporting Harm” was released. BAN works to reduce the harmful effects of exporting e-waste and promotes sustainable solutions to worldwide waste issues. So-called recyclers and scrap brokers were buying e-waste from developed regions throughout the world and dumping it in developing nations. In some parts of these countries, people were dismantling electronics on street corners, instead of in recycling facilities.\nBASEL CONVENTION:\nThe fundamental aims of the Basel Convention are the control and reduction of transboundary movements of hazardous and other wastes including the prevention and minimization of their generation, the environmentally sound management of such wastes and the active promotion of the transfer and use of technologies.\nA Draft Strategic Plan has been proposed for the implementation of the Basel Convention. The Draft Strategic Plan takes into account existing regional plans, programmes or strategies, the decisions of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies, ongoing project activities and process of international environmental governance and sustainable development. The Draft requires action at all levels of society: training, information, communication, methodological tools, capacity building with financial support, transfer of know-how, knowledge and sound, proven cleaner technologies and processes to assist in the concrete implementation of the Basel Declaration. It also calls for the effective involvement and coordination by all concerned stakeholders as essential for achieving the aims of the Basel Declaration within the approach of common but differentiated responsibility.\nElectronic Waste:\nRecycling laptops, computers and other electronic equipment:\nMost electronic waste goes through a recycling system called a WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment), which not only recycles 95-98%, by weight, of all ewaste passed through it, but ensures that any data left on hard drives and memories are thoroughly destroyed too.\nPicking Shed – first all the items are sorted by hand and batteries and copper are extracted for quality control.\nInitial Size Reduction Process – items are shredded into pieces as small as 100mm to prepare the ewaste to be thoroughly sorted. This is also where the data destruction takes place.\nSecondary Size Reduction – the small debris is shaken to ensure that it is evenly spread out on the conveyor belt, before it gets broken down even more. Any dust extracted is disposed of in an environmentally friendly way.\nOverband Magnet – using magnets, steel and iron are removed from the debris.\nMetallic & Non-Metallic Content – aluminium, copper and brass are separated from the non-metallic content. The metallic can then be reused and resold as raw materials.\nWater Separation – water is used to separate plastic from the glass content. Once divided all raw materials can then be resold.\nCathode Ray Tubes – recycling CRT Monitors and Televisions:\nRecycling Cathode Ray Tubes, most commonly found in computer monitors and old televisions, is more complicated than recycling most electronic waste. This is because toxins found within CRT’s are among the most dangerous – CRT’s have lead in the glass which can seriously harm the environment and our health if leaked into soil and water systems.\nSeparation of Monitor Body and Cathode Ray Tube – firstly the front of the monitor is removed so that the tube can be removed from within. The shell is then recycled along with regular ewaste.\nSize reduction process – The tubes and screens are shredded down into small pieces. Any glass dust created in this process is disposed of carefully, in an environmentally friendly way.\nMetal Removal – the broken bits of glass are then passed under magnets, where iron and steel is extracted from the glass material. The remaining material is then passed through Eddy Currents, which removes any aluminium and copper. These materials are then collected and reused as raw materials.\nWashing Line – The remaining glass is then cleared of oxides, phosphors and dust extracts, leaving just clean glass to be sorted.\nGlass Sorting Line – the final stage of CRT recycling sorts the leaded glass from the unleaded glass. These can then both be used in the creation of new screens, which is called closed loop recycling.\nRecycling your electronic waste in this way might not be free, but it’s a small price to pay to avoid sending these toxic materials to landfill, polluting the environment for future generations – especially when they can so easily be recycled.\nDo’s & Don’t:\nDo’s:\nAll electrical and electronic products are required to be handed over only to the Authorized recycler.\nThe product should be handed over only to authorized recycler for disposal.\nKeep the product in isolated area, after it becomes non-functional /un- repairable so as to prevent its accidental breakage.\nDon’ts:\nThe product should not be opened by the User himself / herself, but only by authorised service personnel.\nThe product is not meant for re-sale any unauthorised agencies/scrap dealer/kabariwalahs.\nThe product is not meant for mixing into household waste stream.\nDo not keep any replaced spare part(s) from the pro duct in exposed area.\nDo Not Dispose Off The E-WASTE In Landfills\nClick the below link to downloads the E-Waste documents\ne-waste-management-handling-rules-2011 e-waste ewaste-recycling-wkplace-safety\nE – Waste recycling process\nE- Waste\nApril 2022\nS\nM\nT\nW\nT\nF\nS\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30", "Top Trendy, Exciting New Recycling Tech Making Waves in 2020\nYou are here: Home Blog Top Trendy, Exciting New Recycling Tech Making Waves in 2020\nTop Trendy, Exciting New Recycling Tech Making Waves in 2020\nEvery year, the world pushes forward with tech discoveries, recycling processes, and facilities providing new methods to rehabilitate materials that would otherwise be sent to the landfill. As we’re still early on in 2020, we’ve decided to put together a quick countdown of new, exciting recycling technologies that are at various stages of development. These new, high-tech advancements have the potential to make some big changes to how Canada recycles.\nRare Earth elements recycling\nWe likely face a future where we rely on technology to clean up our messes despite the most obvious approach being to cut down on waste as a whole. Companies like Apple have dedicated significant parts of their R&D to finding how to build electrical components from recyclables. The iPhone 11 impressively used a set of 17 metals recycled for its phones, a feat which experts deemed impossible to do years earlier. The world is changing and with that, products using recycled materials face the brightest future.\nNuclear waste recycling\nOne of the most impressive recycling tech discoveries in the last six months is a process which recycles nuclear waste. Previously believed to be useless and incredibly dangerous, at the University of Bristol researchers have been able to transform nuclear waste into batteries with capacity to provide power for 1,000s of years. The technology is still in its developing stages, infusing nuclear waste extracted from graphic blocks with wafer-thin diamonds to create a battery which could be used in devices like hearing aids and pacemakers, or even to power spacecraft.\nRobotic arm sorter\nVarious versions of robotic arm sorters are being used at recycling facilities all over the world. Recently built facilities have an even more advanced robotic arm sorter with the capacity to recognize different materials and essentially complete the job without human intervention. Although this sort of automation has some worried in the waste management industry, it demonstrates a lesser cost for facilities to operate which could equate to more facilities in the decades to come.\nApple’s Daisy\nDaisy is a material sorting technology invented by Apple. It sorts through more than 200 iPhones every hour, recycling every one for the precious metals utilized in their design. Metals are recyclable because they don’t lose their properties when you recycle them. In an era, where there’s so much electronic waste, there’s a growing interest in metal sorting and material procurement that avoids losing these metals to landfills where they don’t belong.\nLi-Cycle lithium battery recycling processes\nAs an operator, Li-Cycle has come up with a way to recycle between 80 to 100 percent of batteries through mechanize size reduction and material recovery. The process begins by shredding down the packs and battery cells. Then a hydrometallurgical process is used take what’s recyclable after the fact, after a chemical reaction. This process turns hazardous waste into non-hazardous waste. Absolutely spectacular!\nTyton BioSciences clothing recycling\nThe fashion industry creates a lot of clothing waste on an annual basis but through tech and processes like that at Tyton BioSciences, raw materials like cotton pulp and polyester can be retrieved and made into new fabrics. Using hydrothermal processes involving water, heat and pressure, this is one of the cleanest ways to recycle fabrics in this way and could expand in the years to come to include virtually any clothing type. If this ends up being the case, this would eliminate the trillions of pounds of clothing waste generated in any given year.\nPyrowave plastics recycling\nAs one will find a lot of recycling tech is targeting the recycling or processing of plastics. The Pyrowave corporation has come up with a way to regenerate non-recyclable by breaking them down into ‘monomers’ to then be made into new resins that are near identical to virgin plastics. For traditional non-recyclable plastics like PP, PE, PS, and others, this is a major breakthrough suggesting that maybe one day in Canada there may be no such thing as non-recyclable plastic.\nFlameless oxy-combustion\nOriginally designed for the oil and gas industry, flameless oxy-combustion could potentially help recycle unsorted plastics. The process of flameless oxy-combustion produces water, energy, and pure carbon dioxide that is not emitted into the atmosphere. For non-recyclable mixed plastics, this may prove to be a way to regain the energy lost in the manufacturing of plastics while converting the material into usable materials.\nUBQ\nUBQ is another company that’s focused on producing eco-friendly plastics from recycled materials. UBQ uses unsorted household waste to do so however, converting it into eco-sustainable, biodegradable thermoplastics which can be applied in commercial and industrial projects. This is alternative to the petroleum-based plastics that are used today in such applications. By creating natural resources from general items guaranteed to be sent to the landfill, you avoid harmful gases from decomposition, landfill space given away, and more. The company’s process is believed to save 11.7 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents for every 1 kg of plastics produced.\nLoop\nLoop is an initiative launched by TerraCycle in 2019 that takes reusable containers we typically throw out – things like mayonnaise containers and Tide detergent containers – and gives them back to the manufacturer to be refilled and sold back into the consumer base. This is a great example of a recycling process that reduces what households are putting into the waste stream.\nPyrowave styrofoam recycling\nPyrowave, in addition to recycling plastics, has a chemical process by which to break down styrofoam and remanufacture it into new styrofoam. The polystyrene molecules break down via microwave-like technology, resulting in styrene which can then be chemically processed and returned in polystyrene form. Considering how more than four fifths of the styrofoam we use in Canada ends up in our landfills, this is an ideal solution to cut down on yet another source of waste.\nThis is just a little insight into where recycling technologies are at in the first half of 2020. Development continues to speed up on creating products made entirely from recyclables in addition to finding ways to recycle what was formerly thought of as impossible to recycle. For the first time in over a century, a true zero waste society here in Canada seems very possible. Core Mini Bins supports sustainable waste disposal practices, focusing on recycle, refuse, and landfill diversion.

The new year promises a wide range of developments, innovations and trends that are making the world greener.\nThe New York Times recently said that the Covid crisis is now a garbage crisis too. Thanks to pandemic fears, a lot of recyclables ended up being trashed instead. With more waste than ever before, and less being recycled because of transmission concerns – we need technology to step in and help us solve what is fast becoming the most wasteful era in human history.\nLet’s take a closer look at some of the latest and best advances in modern recycling technology. Some of it will be available right away, and some in the near future. This post will orientate you on the brightest minds in the industry and how they’re working to make recycling more effective.\nHere are 5 new recycling technology innovations to watch out for in 2022.\n#1: A Peek into the Metaverse\nMark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse was announced this year, which has far reaching implications for the recycling and waste management sectors. With the arrival of the Metaverse, a clear shift is happening that makes travel less important, and physical presence less necessary.\nThis new evolution of the virtual world is a strong indicator that more and more people will be at home during the average work day. This means people will have the time, resources, and ability to recycle correctly – if equipped with the right tools and education.\nIs your municipality considering the implications of the upcoming metaverse? Technology at all levels is about to function in an integrated virtual and physical environment.\n#2: Plastic That Can Be Recycled\nIt’s been in the works for several years and continues to be a cutting-edge science. Now more than ever, scientists and researchers are experimenting to discover sustainable ways to recycle plastic. So far, one recycling technology that makes it work, belongs to John Layman.\nWorking for Procter and Gamble, Layman has developed ‘PureCycle Technology’ – a way to recycle polypropylene by removing contaminants, odor, and color until nothing is left but a reusable resin.\nPureCycle succeeded in creating a recycled plastic showerhead in 2021, leaving room for more exciting developments as we enter 2022. Imagine having a plastics recycling program where your municipality can collect and recycle residential plastic! The future is coming.\nNeed specific information for where you live?\nWondering about recycling instructions for items in your municipality? Use our Find My Municipality tool and learn recycling information specific to your municipality.\n#3: The Internet of Things Streamlines Recycling Routes\nAlready widely used in Europe, Internet of Things technology uses sensor hardware fitted in garbage disposal units and residential dumpsters to streamline route collections.\nWhen linked with the right front-end software, this can reveal data like who is recycling, where, and how well they are doing it.\nOn a community level, this will allow municipalities to target residential and commercial areas that are not successfully achieving proposed targets. With customized educational programs, IoT technology stands to drastically improve how cities manage how their residents recycle.\n#4: Innovative City Recycling Programs\nFueled by the China ban and the ongoing pandemic, city recycling programs have had to get creative to survive.\nAn upsurge of interest in building sustainable programs has occurred as a result – with many municipalities exploring alternative funding and engagement sources to supplement their operations.\nFunding streams rely heavily on modern technologies like online fundraising platforms, app networks and social media. One thing is for certain, local municipalities should have a way to directly engage with their community about what their recycling needs are in 2022.\n#5: A Better Way to Enhance Recycling Systems\nEven the most efficient mechanical recycling system struggles if the recyclables are contaminated. One way to combat contamination is through RFID technology, or radio frequency identification tech. Tiny, affordable circuits can be embedded in products – and they can store vital information – like how to recycle a particular product, in a particular municipality.\nRFID chips stand to replace the older and completely ineffective recycling symbols of yesteryear. With this new recycling technology, smart recycling bins will form a direct link between residents and municipalities. According to RFID journal, this technology has only just become accessible.\nThat means we will start to see recycling systems rapidly improve in a multitude of ways. The RFID chip is a great example of a small shift that could result in sweeping reform.\nRecycling technology innovation gets more exciting every year. From the introduction of an entirely new iteration of the internet (Metaverse) to the gradual interconnectedness of everything – your municipality is sure to see massive changes over the next few years.\nThe greatest change comes from the toughest challenges. If we’re going to save recycling, we need to embrace the change that technology brings. Let’s dream of a future where recycling isn’t complicated at all. The team at Recycle Coach will be with you every step of the way.\nWhich of these sounds most interesting to you? Tell us below."]}

Natural processes, such as changes in the sun's energy and volcanic eruptions, also affect the earth's climate. However, they do not explain the warming that we have observed over the last century. 1\nHuman Versus Natural Causes\nIt is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.\n- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4\nScientists have pieced together a record of the earth’s climate by analyzing a number of indirect measures of climate, such as ice cores, tree rings, glacier lengths, pollen remains, and ocean sediments, and by studying changes in the earth’s orbit around the sun. 2 This record shows that the climate varies naturally over a wide range of time scales, but this variability does not explain the observed warming since the 1950s. Rather, it is extremely likely (> 95%) that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming. 3\nHuman activities have contributed substantially to climate change through:\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\nReflectivity or Absorption of the Sun’s Energy\nHeat-trapping Greenhouse Gases And The Earth's Climate\nEarth’s Ancient Fever Indicates Earth’s Future Fever\nWatch on\nSource: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, 2018\nGreenhouse Gases\nConcentrations of the key greenhouse gases have all increased since the Industrial Revolution due to human activities. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide concentrations are now more abundant in the earth’s atmosphere than any time in the last 800,000 years. 5 These greenhouse gas emissions have increased the greenhouse effect and caused the earth’s surface temperature to rise. Burning fossil fuels changes the climate more than any other human activity.\nCarbon dioxide: Human activities currently release over 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. 6 Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by more than 40 percent since pre-industrial times, from approximately 280 parts per million (ppm) in the 18th century 7 to 414 ppm in 2020. 8\nMethane: Human activities increased methane concentrations during most of the 20th century to more than 2.5 times the pre-industrial level, from approximately 722 parts per billion (ppb) in the 18th century 9 to 1,867 ppb in 2019. 10\nNitrous oxide: Nitrous oxide concentrations have risen approximately 20 percent since the start of the Industrial Revolution, with a relatively rapid increase toward the end of the 20th century. Nitrous oxide concentrations have increased from a pre-industrial level of 270 ppb 11 to 332 ppb in 2019. 12\nFor more information on greenhouse gas emissions, see the Greenhouse Gas Emissions website. To learn more about actions that can reduce these emissions, see What You Can Do.\nThis graph shows the increase in atmospheric concentrations of three of the key greenhouse gases over the last 2,000 years. Increases in concentrations of these gases since 1750 are due to human activities in the industrial era. Source: U.S. EPA, Climate Change Indicators in the United States: Atmospheric Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases, 2021.\nReflectivity or Absorption of the Sun’s Energy\nActivities such as agriculture, road construction, and deforestation can change the reflectivity of the earth's surface, leading to local warming or cooling. This effect is observed in heat islands, which are urban centers that are warmer than the surrounding, less populated areas. One reason that these areas are warmer is that buildings, pavement, and roofs tend to reflect less sunlight than natural surfaces. While deforestation can increase the earth’s reflectivity globally by replacing dark trees with lighter surfaces such as crops, the net effect of all land-use changes appears to be a small cooling. 13\nEmissions of small particles, known as aerosols, into the air can also lead to reflection or absorption of the sun's energy. Many types of air pollutants undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere to create aerosols. Overall, human-generated aerosols have a net cooling effect on the earth. Learn more about human-generated and natural aerosols.\nNatural Processes\nNatural processes are always influencing the earth’s climate and can explain climate changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s. However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the Earth’s Orbit and Rotation\nChanges in the earth’s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet’s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures. 14 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11°F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2°F warmer than it is today. 15\nVariations in Solar Activity\nChanges in the sun’s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth’s surface. While these changes can influence the earth’s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades. 16 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun’s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen. 17\nThe sun follows a natural 11-year cycle of small ups and downs in intensity (bottom chart), but the effect on the earth is small. Over the same period, the average global temperature has increased markedly (top chart). Source: National Academy of Sciences, Climate Change Evidence & Causes, 2020.\nChanges in the Earth’s Reflectivity\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth’s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed. 18 Natural changes in the earth’s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanic Activity\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO 2 ) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years. 19 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year. 20\nChanges in Naturally Occurring Carbon Dioxide Concentrations\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower. 21 The heating or cooling of the earth’s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. 22 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth’s orbit. 23\nAnalyses of ice core data extending back 800,000 years show that warmer periods on the earth coincide with periods of relatively high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.

Dunne, ... John Harte, in Encyclopedia of Biodiversity (Second Edition), 2013\nConclusions\nThe enhanced greenhouse effect, in conjunction with other anthropogenic stresses, is likely to precipitate unprecedented changes to Earth's climate and ecosystems. Though the details of how climate change will affect biodiversity are often hard to predict, there is little doubt that biological impacts will be pervasive and often dramatic. Studying the effects of climate change on biota can help in the formulation of strategies for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem structure and function in the face of potentially massive change and loss. Such knowledge is also crucial for refining predictions of the future rate and magnitude of climate change, since biological responses are likely to produce significant feedbacks that can augment or dampen climate change at local, regional, and global scales. Understanding and addressing the interactions between climate change and biodiversity represents one of the greatest challenges that scientists and policymakers face in the twenty-first century.\nView chapter Purchase book\nImpact of Past Global Warming on Biodiversity\nGregory J. Retallack, in Encyclopedia of Biodiversity (Second Edition), 2007\nConclusions\nAnthropogenic global warming due to atmospheric pollution by CO 2 and CH 4 is commonly regarded as unprecedented, but the rock and fossil record indicates many comparable past atmospheric redox crises. Commonalities among these past events allow a better understanding of global warming induced by greenhouse gases. Biodiversity generally declined during geologically rapid global warmings due to CO 2 and CH 4 emissions from volcanic eruption and intrusion, meteorite impacts, or outbursts from submarine and permafrost methane clathrates. Extreme cases of greenhouse release to the atmosphere are the great mass extinctions of the fossil record, when many creatures died from the effects of hypoxia, hypercapnia, and pulmonary edema. At lower levels of greenhouse gases, such lethal effects were limited in area to high altitudes, stagnant wetlands, oligotrophic coral reefs, and deep ocean basins. Some consequences of global warming such as increased precipitation and warmth extending to high-latitude intercontinental land bridges had the effects of increasing biodiversity. Hardships such as soil acidification and increased seasonality of climate selected for sclerophyllous, thickly cutinized plants. Hardships such as hypoxia selected for greater respiratory scope in animals. Such adaptations added to biodiversity. The effects on biodiversity of global warming by greenhouse gases are complex, but a rich fossil and rock record of comparable events in the past promises new perspectives on future global warming.\nView chapter Purchase book\nThe Complex Dyanmics of the Climate System\nCarolyn W. Snyder, ... Stephen H. Schneider, in Philosophy of Complex Systems, 2011\n4.2. North Atlantic Thermohaline Ocean Circulation\nAbrupt change in the North Atlantic thermohaline ocean circulation (THC) is the most dramatic example in the climate system of multiple equilibria and thresholds that are duration and path dependent. Paleoclimate evidence of past abrupt changes in the North Atlantic THC revolutionized the field and changed the paradigm from gradual simple systems to abrupt complex systems. Moreover, the North Atlantic THC is of particular interest because it might be significantly altered due to global warming, causing large impacts to the world. Computational models have been useful tools in exploring potential complex system dynamics of the North Atlantic THC. However, our understanding of and ability to model the North Atlantic THC continues to be limited by the complexity of the system.\nThe thermohaline ocean circulation (THC) is a density-driven circulation in the ocean, caused by differences in temperature and salinity, see Figure 5. In the North Atlantic, the THC brings warm tropical water northward, raising sea surface temperatures about 4 o C relative to temperatures at comparable latitudes in the Pacific Ocean [Higgins et al ., 2002 ]. The warmer waters of the North Atlantic warm and moisten the atmosphere, making Greenland and Western Europe roughly 5-8 o C warmer than they otherwise would be and increasing precipitation throughout the region [Stocker and Marchal, 2000; Broecker, 1997 ]. The THC is density-driven: warm, salty water flows into the North Atlantic, becomes more dense as it cools, and then sinks and flows to the southern hemisphere via the deep western boundary current, creating a \"conveyor belt\" of fast moving seawater [Rahmstorf, 2006; Broecker et al ., 1990 ]. Disruption of the density gradient through surface freshening or surface warming could cause a failure of sinking in the North Atlantic that would cause the North Atlantic THC to slow or even stop [Broecker, 1997 ]. The convective mixing process also is a self-sustaining, but highly nonlinear, process [von Deimling et al ., 2006 ]. There is strong evidence that the North Atlantic THC slowed or completely stopped in the Earth's history, causing rapid regional and global climatic changes [Broecker, 1997; Bond et al ., 1997; Rahmstorf, 2000b ].\nSign in to download full-size image\nFigure 5. Schematic representation of the global thermohaline ocean circulation (THC). Surface currents are shown in red, deep waters in light blue and bottom waters in dark blue. The main deep-water formation sites are shown in orange. Average ocean salinity is 35 (represents \"parts per thousand\"). The color-coding for water above 36 and below 34 indicates water significantly different from average. From [Rahmstorf, 2006, Figure 1 ].\nPaleoclimate reconstructions and model simulations suggest that there are multiple equilibria for the THC in the North Atlantic: rapid and repeated switching between equilibria over a period of years to decades is associated with dramatic changes in regional, and potentially global, climate [Alley et al ., 2003 ]. These multiple equilibria constitute an emergent property of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system. Henry Stommel was the first to describe the bi-stability of the North Atlantic THC system, using only a simple two-box model of the ocean [Stommel, 1961 ]. Figure 6 presents a summary of the three possible North Atlantic THC equilibrium states and the theoretical mechanisms for switching between them. In addition, the model predicts response hysteresis in which an earlier transition due to fresh water forcing (arrows \"a\" or \"b\") results in a system requiring a larger stimulus to return to its previous state (arrow \"d\"). A recent intercomparison of 11 different climate models of intermediate complexity found that all models show this North Atlantic THC hysteresis response to freshwater forcing [Rahmstorf et al ., 2005 ]. Both the total amount of freshwater forcing and the rate of forcing are important, because they can determine which of the opposing feedbacks — stabilization from local cooling and destabilization from reduced saltwater input — will dominate, and thus whether a rapid change will occur. Model experiments also find importance for the duration and location of freshwater inputs, in addition to the rate and magnitude of changes in freshwater [Rahmstorf, 2000b ].\nSign in to download full-size image\nFigure 6. Schematic stability diagram for the North Atlantic Thermohaline Ocean Circulation (THC), with solid black lines indicating stable equilibrium states and dotted black lines unstable states. The rate of ocean flow is measured in Sverdrups (Sv): a flow rate of one Sv = one million cubic meters per second. The x-axis shows the amount of freshwater forcing in Sv relative to present. The y-axis shows the strength of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation, also in Sv. Transitions are indicated by arrows: (a) advective spindown, (b) convective shutdown, (c) transition between different convection patterns, and (d) restart of convection. \"S\" marks the Stommel bifurcation beyond which no North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation can be sustained. Adapted from [Rahmstorf, 2000a, Figure 2 ].\nGlobal warming from anthropogenic GHG emissions could potentially impact the North Atlantic THC due to changes in temperature, precipitation, melt water, and circulation patterns. The existence of abrupt past climate changes from changes in the North Atlantic THC has fuelled concern over the possibility of setting off similar changes in the future. Models vary in their predictions of the weakening or shutdown of the North Atlantic THC with future anthropogenic climate change [Solomon et al ., 2007 ]. Disagreement between models on the proximity of the present-day climate to the Stommel bifurcation point 2 and on the relative strengths of various feedback processes makes it difficult to compare model results. It is often unclear what model features are causing some models to not produce North Atlantic THC collapse when other models are [Schneider, 2004 ]. These model disagreements make it difficult to assign confident probabilities to the occurrence of a North Atlantic THC collapse and impossible to rule out global warming-induced North Atlantic THC collapse at a high level of confidence [Rahmstorf et al ., 2005; Schneider and Thompson, 2000 ). Models do agree that the future of the North Atlantic THC is dependent upon which mode it currently is in and the amount and rate of change to the system both from warming and from freshwater increases that result from global warming [Stocker and Schmittner, 1997; Stocker and Marchal, 2000; Higgins et al ., 2002 ].\nView chapter Purchase book\nClimate Change: Cooperation and Human Security\nGwen Sullivan, in Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, & Conflict (Second Edition), 2008\nPart One: Human Hand in Global Warming\nMain Sources\nGlobal warming refers to a trend of rising temperatures both at the Earth’s surface and in the lower atmosphere. As carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere, these gases trap the Earth’s heat and thereby cause temperatures to rise. The burning of fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas) accounts for about three-fourths of global carbon emissions. Deforestation is the second main source, representing at least 20% of all carbon emissions. The clearing and burning of forests releases carbon stored in trees into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Forests have historically absorbed a large portion of carbon emissions as plants photosynthesize water and carbon dioxide into plant growth, thereby slowing the rate of CO 2 accumulation in the atmosphere. Deforestation eliminates these carbon sinks, further accelerating global warming.\nFour main sectors are responsible for the bulk of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels: electricity generation, transportation, industrial processes, and residential and commercial buildings. Agriculture and forestry management also influence the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere.\nThe US and Europe accounted for the major part of the atmospheric buildup of heat-trapping emissions over the last century. In recent times, Europe has taken the lead in curtailing carbon emissions. With 5% of the world’s population, the United States represented 21% of annual global carbon emissions in 2005. Fast-growing economies such as China and India are expected to represent a growing share of global emissions in the upcoming years. In 2005, China was already the second major carbon emitter, representing 18% of the global total.\nIn 2006, China surpassed the United States in recorded annual CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement production, according to the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, though these figures do not include heat-trapping emissions from other sources. Taking into account its large population, China’s per capita emissions are at about a quarter of that in the United States.\nMeanwhile, Africa represents less than 3% of global CO 2 emissions from fuel burning since 1900. While contributing least to the problem, Africa will suffer some of the most severe consequences of global warming. Equity issues remain at the core of negotiations around the global response to climate change, as discussed further in ‘Part two’.\nScientific Consensus on Global Warming and Evolving Political Debates\nSince its founding in 1988, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has tracked scientific understanding of the causes and consequences of global warming, issuing comprehensive assessments about every 5 years. Comprised of a worldwide network of scientists, the IPCC is the main authoritative source on this topic. The IPCC issued its fourth assessment in 2007, which consisted of three reports on (1) the state of climate change science; (2) expected impacts of climate change at different degrees of warming; and (3) options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit temperature increases.\nIn February 2007, the IPCC reported a 90% likelihood that man-made emissions, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have caused most global warming since 1950. The significance of this finding becomes more apparent in the light of earlier reports:\n•\n1990: The IPCC reported that there was evidence of global warming, but its causes could be natural or human.\n•\n1995: The panel concluded that the balance of evidence pointed to a discernible human influence on global climate.\n•\n2001: The scientists reached consensus on a likely probability (66–90%) that human activity caused most of the warming since 1950.\nThe IPCC has thus moved gradually toward greater degrees of scientific certainty over the role of human activity in global warming.\nPolitical debates have tended to follow scientific findings, albeit with considerable lag. Until recently, powerful political sectors in the United States and elsewhere still disputed whether global warming was occurring and whether human activity played a role in causing it. Politicians who disputed findings of human-induced climate change drew on a small minority of scientists to support their views. For several years, media coverage continued to give equal weight to both sides of the dispute, even after the vast majority of scientists had concluded that global warming was indeed a fact. This reporting provides a classic case where “balancing a story by being fair to both sides may not be fair to the truth, if both sides do not in fact have equal weight” (Kovack and Rosenstiel, 2001: 46).\nToday, scientific consensus on the extent of human-induced global warming has brought climate change to the center stage of political debates and forums across countries, while changing the terms of discussion. Debate now centers around what actions and policies to adopt. Who is responsible for curbing emissions? Will governments and citizens have the political will to bring about the necessary changes across society? And who will pay the bill both for shifting to cleaner technologies and for adapting to climate change already underway? These questions are now central to political debates in local, national, and international arenas.\nClimate change experts contributed to these debates by issuing a detailed plan to halt climate change in the IPCC report issued in May 2007. The plan called on countries to shift from a dependence on fossil fuels to a greater reliance on renewable energy, nuclear power, and biofuels. It also recommended adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which captures carbon dioxide from power stations and stores it underground. Recommendations regarding biofuels and nuclear power have generated considerable controversy.\nThe IPCC report also looked at ways to improve energy efficiency in vehicles, industry, and buildings; to save forests as carbon sinks; and to cap agricultural emissions, among other measures. It detailed the most promising technologies for reducing emissions and estimated the costs involved in shifting to them if the world began to act immediately. It also looked at policies such as taxes or quotas on carbon emissions that could encourage the development of these technologies.\nThe scientists concluded that the world already had the necessary technology and financial resources to reduce global carbon emissions and thereby avert devastating global warming. The time for action is now. In 2007, the IPCC warned the international community that it could have as little as 8 years to prevent a global average temperature rise of above 2 °C, the threshold at which the most severe consequences were projected to occur. With this assessment, the scientists shifted responsibility to governments and citizens, who would decide what actions to take in light of the projected impacts of unmitigated climate change.\nView chapter Purchase book\nEnvironmental Sciences\nChunglin Kwa, in International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences (Second Edition), 2015\nClimate Skepticism\nGlobal warming as a policy issue made its breakthrough in 1988, when James Hansen, the Director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, delivered a famous testimony before a Committee of the American Congress. Presidential Candidate George H. Bush promised ‘to counter the Greenhouse effect by the White House effect.’ A year later, physicist William Nierenberg requested and received permission to present at the White House an unpublished report of the George C. Marshall Foundation (of which he was a cofounder), in which naturally fluctuating sun spots were identified as the sole cause of global warming and the link between global warming and human use of fossil fuels was denied (Oreskes and Conway, 2010 ). From then on, and in marked contrast with the European Union, the US government would refrain from policies to bring down carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere.\nFrederick Seitz, another cofounder of the Marshall Institute, in a first-page article of the Wall Street Journal in 1996, accused the IPCC of fraud. The immediate target was a study by climate scientist Ben Santer, published in the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (1995). Santer had identified a ‘human fingerprint’ in the warming of the atmosphere, a particular aspect that could not be explained by the sun's activity but which could be explained by the raised level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. According to Seitz, the IPCC had not followed its own rules of peer-reviewed check before publishing Santer's study. The IPCC had in fact conducted such a check, although it has since sharpened its procedures. Santer's finding still stands, although at the time the damage to the IPCC and Santer personally was considerable.\nFrom an overview of the interventions in the policy arena by Nierenberg, Seitz, and some fellow ‘climate skeptics’ such as Fred Singer, it has been found that their denial of a human influence on global warming is connected with a broader agenda. Enjoying considerable influence as elder statesmen of science, they have also made their mark by casting doubt on the deleterious effects of acid rain and the damaging effects of chlorofluorocarbons on the ozone layer, and they also denied the effects on health of passive smoking. The common denominator is that they opposed all governmental environmental regulation, in line with economic interests that oppose such regulations as antibusiness (Lahsen, 2005; Oreskes and Conway, 2010 ).\nNierenberg and Seitz were elite scientists, but in the cause of climate skepticism they were joined by a number of activists and citizen scientists. Steven McIntyre, a retired Canadian businessman, with an educational background in mathematics and economics, in 2005 launched ‘Climate Audit,’ a blog that scrutinizes climate data. McIntyre in particular attacked the validity of the reconstruction of the Earth's temperature over the last 1000 years by climatologist Michael Mann. Called ‘the hockey stick graph,’ the graphic reconstruction shows a steady but slow decline in temperature until 1900, and a steep rise thereafter. The controversy was long and bitter, and drew in many parties, including the US National Academy of Sciences and the US Congress. To date, the hockey stick has been confirmed by a number of subsequent temperature reconstructions (Edwards, 2010 ).\nView chapter Purchase book\nEnvironmental Risks\nY. Chen, G. Pryce, in International Encyclopedia of Housing and Home, 2012\nAbstract\nGlobal warming is likely to increase precipitation and storminess in many parts of the world. It is also likely to raise sea levels and distort regional weather patterns. At the same time, urbanisation may increase drainage problems and cause some areas to become more vulnerable to subsidence. Because the costs of flood defence rise disproportionately with the height of barriers, comprehensive flood protection will not be viable in many areas. Climate migration and temporary displacement of flooded populations will pose major challenges for housing systems. Encouraging individuals to take responsibility for their own flood resilience has so far proved problematic. Planners face the difficult task of identifying and managing optimal changes to land use patterns in the light of uncertain flood risk estimates, making sense of house price signals, and providing appropriate incentives for firms and households. House prices are important because of their impact on personal and institutional financial stability and as a potential measure of welfare loss. However, decision-makers need to be clear about the meaning of economic loss, and the potential pitfalls associated with employing hedonic house price analysis to estimate the impact on human well-being.\nView chapter Purchase book\nReducing Vehicle Emissions Through Cap-and-Trade Schemes\nJohn German, in Driving Climate Change, 2007\nPublisher Summary\nGlobal warming is a worldwide problem that is growing in importance. Carbon released during fossil fuel burning is the primary contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and cap-and-trade programs are actively being developed worldwide to provide a sound economic framework for reducing carbon emissions. Encouraged by the past success of emissions trading programs, many energy and environmental specialists are looking to implement carbon trading across all carbon sectors. Most of these plans implicitly assume that motor vehicles can easily be incorporated into the global cap-and-trade programs that already exist for other energy sectors. Upstream trading reduces emissions via two mechanisms: emissions can be reduced as a direct result of the allocation of emission allowances, and direct activities to reduce emissions on the part of fuel producers can reduce fuel demand by increasing the cost of fuel production. The advantage of upstream trading systems is that administration is simplified because of the relatively small number of regulated firms in the upstream industry. Upstream trading schemes have low administrative costs, but they promise little direct reduction of motor vehicle fuel consumption. Downstream trading schemes shift the responsibility for carbon emissions from fuel producers to vehicle owners or operators.\nView chapter Purchase book\nClimate Change and Sustainable Development\nHongtu Zhao, in The Economics and Politics of China's Energy Security Transition, 2019\nExpanding Global Climate Change Consensus\nGlobal warming, only one of the challenges mankind is facing, cannot only be used to summarize all the issues of climate change but also cannot represent all the environmental issues. At present, the international community, to some extent, deifies climate change, exaggerating its threats and ignoring other environmental and global issues. The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman proposes that the word “global weirding” should be used instead of the word “global warming” and that the rise in global temperature and climate change should be described by “variation” [13]. Dennis Meadows believes that the world’s understanding of global climate change is still very limited. “Global warming” cannot sufficiently describe the global climate problem, the essence of which is that human beings always pursue unlimited development with limited resources on the earth.\nThe Copenhagen Consensus Center, led by Bjorn Lomborg, conducted a study which proposes a hypothesis that how $50 billion should be spent to maximize the benefits for humanity. In the last 17 proposals, AIDS, food subsidies for women and children, and malaria control are ranked in the top 3, while Kyoto Protocol is ranked the 16th. The study argues that the cost of Kyoto Protocol would far outweigh its benefits and its implementation would cost at least $150 billion a year. The United Nations Children's Fund estimates that only $70–$80 billion a year would be enough to allow residents of all Third World countries to get the most basic clean water, sanitation, basic health care, and education.\nIn response to global environmental problems, developed and developing countries should strive to eliminate their cognitive differences and jointly promote global environmental governance and related technical cooperation. Because of the different stages of economic development, there are many cognitive differences and misunderstandings between developing countries and developed countries on climate change. In developing countries, some analysts argue that there is a plot behind the theory of climate change, that is, to prevent developing countries from continuing to develop. Some analysts also argue that it is a scheme for some interest groups to seek benefits as well as some scientists to secure more funding. In fact, the developed countries attach great importance to environmental protection mainly out of consideration of their own sustainable development. These countries have developed to the post-industrialization stage, which not only have a strong demand and desire to improve environmental quality but also have adequate economic and institutional guarantees. The developed countries have urged the major developing countries to reduce their emissions, to some extent, to avoid free riding of developing countries, which is a manifestation of international political economy and diplomatic game. If it only boils down to the plot of some countries, it is detrimental to not only the solution of climate change but also to the sustainable development of developing countries themselves.\nSimilarly, for developed countries, to understand the relation between the stage of economic development and the concept of sustainable development is also necessary for narrowing the cognitive differences and understanding the position of developing countries. The World Bank proposes that although human beings have jeopardized the environment in the early stages of economic growth, they should be constructive in the later stages. Environmental awareness in many countries has been highlighted with the economic growth of the country, and the increase of social wealth and technological progress have greatly enhanced the environmental governance capacity of various countries. The primitive humans did not “live in harmony with nature” as we imagined but develop natural resources in a nonsustainable way. In today’s world, many poor people are also to a large extent carrying out slash-and-burn farming, using wood for cooking and heating and killing endangered wildlife [14]. Therefore, the environmental issue is essentially a development issue as well, and the anticipation of the developed countries for developing countries to reduce emissions should be compatible with the development stage and environmental governance capacity.\nAt present, the existing climate policies in many countries are more based on considerations of energy security and economic growth, and the importance and the urgency of combating climate change has not yet become the core of their climate policies. The climate change bill, American Clean Energy and Security Act, that Obama strongly advocated after he took office, was opposed by many members of the Senate. In the Republican camp, initially there are some individual supports, but their main consideration is not to push the United States to respond to climate change but to respond to clean energy competitions and challenges from the countries such as China. And after they gave up their supports, Obama’s climate change bill was naturally doomed to fail.\nTo make importance and urgency of climate change become a core pillar of all countries’ climate policy and safeguard the sustainability of climate policy, it is vital to proceed from expanding consensus on climate change. Countries in the world should objectively and rationally popularize the severity and harmfulness of climate change, avoiding absoluteness and subjectivism and allowing doubts about mainstream views. In the short term, this may cause some people’s concern and support for climate change to decline, but it will help reduce the blindness and one-sidedness in the international community in researching and coping with climate change in the long run and make relevant climate policies become more rational cost–benefit analysis rather than fear of the exaggerated dangers and even end of the world.\nView chapter Purchase book\nWhy discuss the impacts of climate change?\nTrevor M. Letcher, in The Impacts of Climate Change, 2021\n9 How global warming affects society\nGlobal warming affects societies in many ways. Here below are a few examples:\n•\nReduces the area available for farming and for human occupation through droughts, floods, and climate change resulting in food shortages.\n•\nSea level rises result in a loss of housing and farmland which in turn involves human migration, and expensive new housing/buildings.\n•\nRisk of life increases and insurance premiums rise—all insurers suffer.\n•\nNeed rapid development of renewable energy to replace fossil fuel.\n•\nPressure on industry to improve efficiencies, leading to more expensive products.\n•\nHealth suffers in many ways. For example, malaria becomes more widespread as a small rise in temperature results in a large vectoral capacity of mosquitoes (development of anopheles is shorter, bites by females increases as gonadotrophic cycle is shortened, incubation period of plasmodium decreases).\n•\nHeat waves kill. It has been estimated that the heatwave in Europe, in 2003, with temperatures of over 45°C, killed 70,000 people. In France, the number of heatwaves has doubled over the past 40 years and is expected to double again by 2050.\n•\nEconomics—everything costs more—electric car, electricity, imported food, insurance, need more air conditioning.\n•\nWild fires—loss of homes, loss of habitat for animals and wild animals.\n•\nRise in extreme weather patterns (flooding, gales, droughts, too hot, too cold…) reduce time for working.\n•\nFlooding low lying areas of the world causes a loss of infrastructure and housing.\n•\nIncreased tropical typhoons and hurricanes leading to loss of life, housing and occupations.\n•\nDroughts—causes of starvation, food shortages, loss of occupation, start of wars—catalyst for unrest in Syria, civil war and human migration, refugees, droughts are reputed to be the most expensive weather-related disasters;\n•\nMental anguish as a result.\nView chapter Purchase book\nRural Social Work\nMargaret Alston, in International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences (Second Edition), 2015\nCritical Factors – Climate Uncertainty and Globalization\nGlobal warming is having an unprecedented impact on our environment, landscape, and social spaces and cuts deeply into rural areas. Slow onset events such as drought and rising temperatures affect cropping cycles, the types of crops that can be grown, the capacity of farmers to produce an income, and both food and water security (Garnaut, 2008, 2011 ). Cataclysmic events such as cyclones, fires, and floods cause deaths and injuries, decimate communities, affect agricultural and fishing industries, destroy infrastructure and income generating activity, and change the landscape, often irrevocably (Opdam et al., 2009; Campbell, 2008; Proudley, 2008 ).\nAcross the world, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate and environmental disasters are deeply affecting rural people and places. A range of recent disasters causing major social trauma include flooding in the Philippines (Tatlonghari and Paris, 2012 ), bushfires in Australia (Hargreaves, 2012; Proudley, 2008 ), drought and cyclones in Bangladesh (Alston, 2013 ), hurricanes in the US (Enarson, 2009 ), rising sea levels in the Pacific (Alston and Vize, 2010 ), and earthquakes in Japan (Barusch, 2011) and New Zealand (Lynch, 2011 ). Many of these events are located in rural areas where whole communities are affected by trauma and tragedy. Social workers should note that climate change is not only causing environmental disasters, but also immense social distress and thus is a human rights issue (Tester, 2012 ).\nClimate change events are but one of a suite of social, economic, and environmental factors that will impact on food producing areas. With the world population expected to rise from 7 thousand to 9 thousand million by 2040 (The United Nations Secretary General's High-level Panel on Global Security, 2012 ), creating significant consequences for food and water security; a growing middle class in Asia and the subcontinent placing more pressure on food production (Gillard, 2012 ); predicted fuel shortages (Newman et al., 2009 ); conflict and political instability in many areas; and massive people movements – resulting from these factors (McAdam, 2012 ), the stresses on the environment and on people in rural areas are magnified. By 2030, the world will need at least 50% more food, 45% more energy, and 30% more water despite the fact that food production cycles are interrupted by climate events (The United Nations Secretary General's High-level Panel on Global Security, 2012 ). Rural spaces will become the locus of major transformations, instability, and ongoing environmental pressures at the same time as the world requires significantly more food and water resources.\nGlobalization, or the instigation of a global marketplace creating global interdependencies, is drawing wealth and capacity from the local to the global arena (Gray and Lawrence, 2001 ). In the process, it is providing a compelling influence for people to move to cities to work, often in jobs based on the knowledge economy. Globalization has resulted in significant changes in rural areas as agricultural producers are now dependent on a world market, their income subject to global circumstances and their capacity to respond to higher productivity demands diminished (Lawrence, 2005 ). Without adequate policies and programs, communities plagued by poverty, climate challenges, and out-migration pressures are ill-equipped to address future uncertainties.\nPart of the problem is that there are limited attempts to create complex interlinked rural policies that cross-portfolio areas. Thus, it would seem evident that enhanced information technology will assist health delivery in isolated areas with low levels of services. Yet, in Australia at least, many areas are without mobile phone coverage and significant portions of rural Australia are not covered by technology that will assist service delivery. Additionally, with the centralization of services away from rural areas it would seem obvious that cheap, readily available transport is necessary to ensure that access is not corrupted by distance. Again, this is not the case, leaving the impression that, as the political influence of these areas decline, rural communities are abandoned and the citizenship rights of rural people are overlooked under the banner of efficiency and neoliberal economic philosophy.\nView chapter Purchase book", "Climate Change: Causes, Effects, and Solutions  | Wiley\nAtmospheric Sciences\nClimate Change: Causes, Effects, and Solutions\nExcerpt 1: (PDF)\nDownload Product Flyer\nDescription\nBuy Both and Save 25%!\nBuy Both and Save 25%!\nAbout the Author\nPermissions\nTable of contents\nFeatures\nSelected type: Paperback\nQuantity:\nPrint on Demand\n$97.75\nAdd to cart\nClimate Change: Causes, Effects, and Solutions\nJohn T.

While land areas and the atmosphere absorb some sunlight, the majority of the sun’s radiation is absorbed by the ocean. Particularly in the tropical waters around the equator, the ocean acts a as massive, heat-retaining solar panel. Earth’s atmosphere also plays a part in this process, helping to retain heat that would otherwise quickly radiate into space after sunset.\nThe ocean doesn't just store solar radiation; it also helps to distribute heat around the globe. When water molecules are heated, they exchange freely with the air in a process called evaporation. Ocean water is constantly evaporating, increasing the temperature and humidity of the surrounding air to form rain and storms that are then carried by trade winds, often vast distances. In fact, almost all rain that falls on land starts off in the ocean. The tropics are particularly rainy because heat absorption, and thus ocean evaporation, is highest in this area.\nimage from  National Ocean Service - NOAA\nOcean Systems\nspecific heat capacity\nsurface ocean currents\nCoastal margins\nAtmospheric circulatory systems\nair motion\npressure variations\ngeneral circulation models\n7.2.U3 Human activities are increasing levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs, such as carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor) in the atmosphere, which leads to\nan increase in the mean global temperature\nincreased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events\nthe potential for long term changes in climate and weather patters\nrise in sea level.\n​[ GHGs are those atmospheric gases that absorb infrared radiation, causing global temperatures to be higher than they would otherwise be.]\n[Students should be able to distinguish between the natural and the enhanced greenhouse effect and to identify a variety of human activities that contribute to GHG emissions.

This is clearly a very complex task, so models are built to estimate trends rather than events. For example, a climate model can tell you it will be cold in winter, but it can’t tell you what the temperature will be on a specific day – that’s weather forecasting. Climate trends are weather, averaged out over time - usually 30 years. Trends are important because they eliminate - or \"smooth out\" - single events that may be extreme, but quite rare.

An overwhelming majority (97%) of climate scientists now accept these findings.\nFor information on how you can help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (also known as your 'carbon footprint') please visit the section Act Now.\nHere are some key human activities that contribute to climate change.\nBurning of fossil (mineral) fuels\nThis tops the list of human activities that contribute to increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Fossil fuels such as petroleum, natural gas (e.g. methane) and coal constitute major energy sources for industries, transport and heating in our homes. It is estimated that burning of fuels world-wide produces around 21.3 billion tons (21.3 gigatons) of carbon dioxide every year. Part of the carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels are burned is absorbed naturally by plants and oceans, but the rest gets caught up in the atmosphere and causes global warming.\nPoor use of land\nPoor land use is directly linked to climate change partly because, when soil and vegetation are lost, more carbon dioxide is released into atmosphere and less can be absorbed, which results in further global warming.\nExamples of poor use of land include urban sprawl (uncontrolled urban development), destruction of forests and excessive farming.\nWaste disposal\nIf waste is not properly treated or disposed of, it produces greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide. These gases contribute to global warming. Disposal of waste by landfill is a key source of man-made methane emissions in the atmosphere. This is one reason why it is so important to reduce waste or recycle it.\nCooling units and aerosol sprays\nWhen the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) in aerosol sprays and as coolants in fridges, freezers and air conditioners was phased out in order to prevent ozone layer depletion, CFCs and HCFCs were replaced with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The use of HFCs is restricted in the UK as they also contribute to global warming.\nUKELA is not responsible for the content of external\ninternet sites"]}
{"query_id": "233", "generated_response": "Based on the research, social media's impact on teenage mental health is complex, with both significant benefits and concerning risks. Here's what current studies reveal:\n\n## Negative Effects on Mental Health\n\n### Depression and Anxiety Correlations\nResearch shows concerning patterns: teens who spend more time on social media platforms report higher rates of depression and anxiety symptoms [1][2]. Studies have found that teens using social media for 2+ hours daily were more likely to experience psychological distress and suicidal thoughts [1]. However, it's important to note that correlation doesn't necessarily equal causation [8][10].\n\n### Key Mechanisms Contributing to Mental Health Problems\n\n**Social Comparison and Low Self-Esteem**\n- Teens constantly compare themselves to carefully curated online images, leading to feelings of inadequacy [3][4][5]\n- Instagram and Snapchat are particularly linked to body image concerns and eating disorders [6][11]\n- The pressure to appear \"perfect\" online can consume teens and trigger depressive feelings [4]\n\n**Sleep Disruption**\n- 60% of adolescents use phones within an hour of bedtime, getting an hour less sleep than non-users [15]\n- Poor sleep quality is a major contributor to depression in teenagers [7][15]\n- Blue light and stimulating content interfere with healthy sleep patterns [15]\n\n**Cyberbullying and Social Isolation**\n- Online harassment can lead to severe mental health consequences including suicidal thoughts [1][3]\n- Less face-to-face interaction reduces development of empathy and real-world social skills [3][5]\n- FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) creates anxiety about not being included in social activities [2][13]\n\n## Positive Effects on Mental Health\n\n### Support and Connection\nSocial media can provide crucial benefits, especially for marginalized teens:\n- LGBTQ+ youth and those with mental health struggles can find supportive communities they might not access otherwise [4][5][12]\n- Over half of teens report giving and receiving emotional support online [2]\n- Platforms allow connection with friends who live far away, maintaining important relationships [2]\n\n### Self-Expression and Identity Formation\n- Teens who express opinions on social media experience increased well-being and self-awareness [12]\n- Social media provides a space for teens to explore their identity safely [4]\n- Mental health resources and positive inspiration are readily available [12]\n\n## The Causation Debate\n\nRecent research challenges the assumption that social media directly causes depression. A major 2020 Columbia University study of over 74,000 students found that **daily social media use was not a strong risk factor for depressive symptoms** [8][9]. Instead, the evidence suggests that:\n\n- Teens who are already struggling with mental health may be more likely to seek out social media interactions [1][10]\n- For girls with existing depression, increased social media use may be a coping mechanism rather than a cause [10]\n- The relationship may be bidirectional - depression can lead to increased social media use [10]\n\n## Finding Balance\n\nThe key appears to be **how** teens use social media rather than simply how much time they spend on it [8]. Experts recommend:\n\n- **Moderation**: Limiting use to 30 minutes daily can reduce anxiety and depression symptoms [11]\n- **Mindful usage**: Being aware of how social media makes you feel and adjusting accordingly [15]\n- **Maintaining offline connections**: Ensuring face-to-face social interactions continue [2][15]\n- **Creating boundaries**: No phones before bedtime and during family time [4][7]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile social media presents real risks for teenage mental health - particularly around social comparison, sleep disruption, and cyberbullying - it's not necessarily the direct cause of rising depression rates that many initially believed. The platforms can also provide valuable support and connection for teens who might otherwise feel isolated. The focus should be on helping teens develop healthy, mindful social media habits rather than complete avoidance [1][2][12].", "citations": ["https://www.teenvogue.com/story/positive-social-media-effects-on-teen-mental-health\n", "https://students4sc.org/2020/12/11/the-effects-of-social-media-on-teens-mental-health/\n", "https://www.grwhealth.com/post/the-potential-impact-of-social-media-on-teens-mental-health", "https://www.northshore.org/healthy-you/how-social-media-effects-teenagers-mental-health/\n", "https://www.psycom.net/social-media-teen-mental-health\n", "https://newsela.com/read/teen-emotional-health-social-media", "https://www.nwpc.com/social-media-addiction-affects-teenagers/", "https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-08-teens-social-media-depression.html", "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200812094844.htm", "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beauty-sick/201905/does-social-media-use-really-cause-depression-in-teens", "https://www.nerdsflow.com/does-social-media-cause-depression/", "https://www.newportacademy.com/resources/empowering-teens/positives-of-social-media/\n", "https://theoascenter.com/social-media-anxiety-and-depression-in-teens/\n", "https://www.psycom.net/depression-teens-social-media\n", "https://wundef.com/does-social-media-cause-depression/"], "contexts": ["Positive Social Media Effects on Teen Mental Health | Teen Vogue\nMental Health\nHow Social Media Can Actually Help Teens Suffering from Depression and Anxiety\nGet ready to tweet your friends about this.\nBy Julie Pennell\nAugust 6, 2015\nArt by Wesley Johnson\nWe’ve heard plenty about studies that show the negative effects of social media on your self-esteem and mental health, but are there any positives? Apparently so — if you look for it or create positive examples for yourself and your online social community.\nRecently, researchers found that teens who used sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat for two or more hours a day were more likely to experience poor mental health, psychological distress and suicidal thoughts. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that social media platforms cause these issues. It can be a bit of a catch-22, as those who suffer from mental health problems are seeking out interactions with others online because they feel isolated or alone, as one of the paper’s authors told the Huffington Post.\nSo if that’s the case, maybe social media can actually help teens suffering from depression and anxiety. Dr. Melinda Ring wrote an article for CNN explaining that her teenage son had been going through some hard times with a mood disorder and found solace in his interactions on social media. He focused his Instagram account on positivity and support for others, and well, his 6,000+ loyal follower base is proof that messages of hope and support resonate and are appreciated, as his mom pointed out.\nYes, there are definitely negative effects of social media on mental health. Cyberbullying, for example, can lead to severe mental anguish and suicidal thoughts (if you’re experiencing that, get help immediately by telling an adult or calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-8255). But as Dr. Ring revealed in her column, perhaps it can also save those going through hard times by showing that they’re not alone.\nThe bottom line? Just as with almost everything in life, there are good sides and bad sides to social media. Proceed with caution, use responsibly, and try to make it a positive experience.\nGo behind-the-scenes of Teen Vogue’s September issue with our cover star, Ansel Elgort.\nKeywords Social Networking Social Media Mental Health depression", "The Effects Of Social Media On Teens' Mental Health - Students 4 Social Change\nMental Health Social Media Technology\nThe Effects Of Social Media On Teens’ Mental Health\nSophia Takrouri • December 11, 2020 • 0 Comments • 18.3k\nShare 0\nIntroduction\n20 years ago, it definitely wasn’t normal to see a teen carrying a smartphone around seemingly 24/7, constantly checking their various social media accounts. Nowadays, social media seems to be an important part of the average teenager’s life. Thousands of teens are currently involved in popular platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok.\nThe availability of social media can bring positive effects to teenagers, such as allowing them to communicate and form positive interactions with people who live far away. They can also form new friendships and possibly find support amongst other teens when they are in need of it.\nHowever, social media can have negative effects on teens’ mental health as well, such as causing them to feel pressured to be online all the time or exposing them to potential cyberbullying, both of which can affect a teen’s happiness and self-esteem.\nEven though terminating the use of social media completely is an option, parents and teens should instead work together to set reasonable limits on time spent using social media because its use can contain positive effects on mental health as well.\nPositive Effects\nSocial media can bring positive effects to teens’ mental health, such as allowing them to stay in touch with people who live far away. If friends have moved away, they can still remain in contact through social media, which c an help keep the friendship alive and can improve the teen’s happiness, which improves their mental health.\nSocial media platforms can also give teens a place to feel comfortable expressing themselves and to get support and help when they need it. According to a study performed by senior research scientist Linda Charmaraman, more than half of teens in the study reported giving and receiving emotional support online. This can help teens who are struggling with mental illness or are having trouble with finding their identity. Receiving support from other people through social media can help improve their happines s, which is a positive effect on their mental health.\nNegative Effects\nEven with its positive effects, social media can have a negative effect on teens’ mental health as well.\nOne issue teens may face upon using social media is the fear of missing out (FOMO). Teens may feel pressured to stay constantly active on their various social media platforms to avoid missing out on anything their friends may be apart of. This fear can lead them to prioritize their social media lives over in-person communication or over healthy sle eping habits, as they may wake up in the middle of the night to check social media. Lack of sleep and in-person communication can both lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, a negative effect on a teen’s mental health.\nSocial media can also expose teens to cyberbullying. This type of harsh treatment can have severe effects on a teen’s mental health. A bullied teen can easily experience low self-esteem, loneliness, depressio n, and/or a nxiety and may even consider or commit suicide.\nReasonable Solutions\nIf social media is taking a toll on a teen’s mental health, it may seem reasonable for them to do away with it completely. However, this may not be a good solution, as separating the teen from social media altogether may worsen any negative emotions. This is because doing away with social media completely will also take away the positive experiences that teens may have, such as chatting with friends from far away or receiving a healthy amount of support online. If a teen is taken away from these positive experiences that they may have been enjoying, they might end up feeling worse.\nBecause all teens are different, as well as their issues with social media, it is important for parents and teens to work together to find what exactly is causing their negative feelings and how they can resolve them. Perhaps there is a certain aspect of a social media platform that is bothering the teen, or maybe it is the entire platform altogether or the people they are surrounded by that they need to avoid. Different teens require different solutions to their problems, and it is important for teens and parents to communicate effectively to identify these problems and solutions. By taking this approach, parents can help teens limit their time spent on social media to a reasonable, healthy amount, or do away with it altogether if need be, which can help improve their mental health overall.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, social media can have both positive and negative effects on teens’ mental health. If a teen’s mental health is starting to become negatively affected by social media, it is important for parents and teens to work together to find the cause of their negative feelings and to work out reasonable limitations to time spent on social media. By doing this, there should be an improvement in teens’ mental health overall.\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and/or student and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of United 4 Social Change Inc., its board members, or officers.\nTags: mental health Social Media technology teens\nPrevious post\nTrump Chooses Amy Coney Barrett For SCOTUS\nNext post\nThe Government Must Pay Reparations To Eligible African Americans\nThe Author All posts\nSophia Takrouri\nSophia Takrouri is a rising junior at Mount Vernon High School.

While some small studies have been conducted, it’s not possible yet to gather long term impact. There’s also the constantly evolving nature and platforms that makes research more challenging.\nWhile there are some noted benefits to the instant virtual connection they can make with their peers they might never otherwise meet, there is also the negative impact of constant comparison, bullying, and a new level of virtual peer pressure.\nIt’s important if the negative effects to begin to have an impact on a teen’s mental health, to seek support and guidance early, to help them work through the issues before they escalate. This can be in the form of cognitive talk therapy or psychiatric treatment.\nSocial media is constantly evolving, and over time kids younger and younger are using it. This makes studying its effects on children and teens challenging.\nConcerning Results from Initial Studies\nResults from several small studies certainly raise concerns ranging from increased risk for depression and sleep issues, to eating disorders\nTeens who spent more time on social media had 2.2 more risk on average of reporting eating disorder and body image concerns. Those with the highest use had 2.6 times more risk.\nThe more times teen spend on social media, they more likely they would report symptoms of depression and having trouble sleeping, especially when used within 30 minutes of going to bed.\nThere’s evidence of a concerning “herd mentality” resulting from “likes”, noting the reward certain of the brain lights up when they receive a “like” and they are more likely to like something regardless of its content, when it already has a lot of likes.\nSocial Media Benefits for Teens\nWhile there’s much room for concern, there are also some social and emotional benefits to social media use, especially for teens who struggle socially or who identify with marginalized groups. The ability to connect almost immediately with like minded peers, some who they may never have the ability to meet in real life, makes socializing easier and helps teens struggling to feel less isolated and alone. These online peer groups can provide commoradary and support they may otherwise never find.\nNegative Impact from Social Media\nWhen comparing the potential positives with potential negatives the negative impact of social media on teens wellbeing, the negative seems to outweigh the positive.  The amount of time they spend on social media certainly impacts the potential damage done, but in addition to increased risk of anxiety and depression, the negatives include:\nLess Real Life Interaction- Human connection is a powerful experience, helping us develop compassion and empathy (both important skills to combat bullying). The more time teens spend socially digitally they less time they get to practice real world social skills.\nConstant Comparing- Even knowing that everyone is curating their best moments for the social feeds, it’s still hard not to get caught up in comparing to their peers. From personal successes and material possessions to physical appearance, everyone’s personal life is amplified online.\nCyberbullying- The real life disconnect seems to make bullying so much easier, making the bullies more brazen and more likely to do or say things they may never do face to face with a peer. Teen girls are at a particularly higher risk, but boys also face cyberbullying. The victims often face anxiety, depression, and sometimes suicidal thoughts.\n“Like” Craving- The desire to garner more and more ”likes” can motivate teens to do things they otherwise might not do, including anything from altering their appearance, engage in bullying, and accepting risky social media challenges.\n“ Fake Friend” Dangers- The more friends they accept, the more “friend of friends” can see their personal information, from birth dates and family details to personal photos and insights, that can be used for various nefarious intentions.\nLike everything moderation is key, and time spent on social media certainly plays a role in its impact on mental health and well being. There’s no need to block all social media despite the risks, what’s important is to find a health balance and relationship with the digital world and to always seek professional help before the burden of the negative impacts becomes too much to bear.\nFor questions, partnerships, or to get covered on the GRW blog, click here.", "How Social Media Effects Teenagers’ Mental Health | NorthShore\nHome » Healthy You » How Social Media Effects Teenagers’ Mental Health\nSocial Health: Teenagers’ Mental Health and Social Media\nFriday, September 28, 2018 8:22 AM\nTags: mental health,teens,social media\nSocial media is constantly running in the background of life. We can share, snap, tweet, like and reblog at all hours of the day. According to a British Psychological Society, approximately 90 percent of teenagers are on social media. Constantly seeing what their peers are doing on a day-to-day basis can be damaging to their mental health.\nLara Jakobsons, PhD, Psychologist at NorthShore, discusses the effects that social media can have on teenagers’ mental health:\nIncreased time, increased risk. The more time adolescents are engaged with social media outlets, the higher the risk there is for poor sleep, low self-esteem, and increases in depression or anxiety. The more emotionally invested they are in one site in particular, the more pressure and anxiety they may experience to be available and up-to-date at all times.\nPoorly advised. It’s nothing new; teens have always been wary of asking parents or other adults for advice. With hundreds of friends on social media in the palm of their hands, teenagers often turn to social networks to seek advice that is often misguided.\nInstigated fights. Cyberbullying has become a concern for parents of adolescents. Strangers, even friends, are able to hide behind the screen and say things they often wouldn’t be able to face-to-face. Teens often encounter fights on Facebook, subtweeting on Twitter and hurtful comments on Instagram – tactics often used just for the purpose of putting down others.\nSkewed perceptions and social comparison. It is common for teens, especially girls, to experience pressure to appear “perfect” online. The need to appear to have perfect hair, to look skinny or fit, to have the perfect group of friends or the need to get the right amount of likes can consume teens. Not meeting these invisible standards can cause self-loathing and self-doubt. Social comparison, loneliness and jealousy can result when friends on social media “appear” more popular and attractive or on a glamorous vacation, which can trigger depressive feelings.\nWith social media a simple click away, how can parents help their teens? Dr. Jakobsons suggests:\nEducation. It is beneficial for parents to understand what social media is being used for by their teen and how. Being educated in how they use it will help parents understand the risks involved.\nCommunication. Parents should have frequent conversations with their teens about the safety of social media, how much personal information should and shouldn’t be shared and about cyberbullying. Studies show that teenagers who had their parents talk to them often, engaged in less risky behaviors.\nMonitor time. Enforce rules to limit excessive use of social media. Examples of limiting time may include no phones at the table, no phone in car rides during errands or turning off WiFi at bedtime.\nHealthy attitudes. To minimize social comparison and envy, parents and teens should talk about the distorted views of friends’ lives that are presented on social media. Teens should feel confident, not more depressed, after viewing social media. Encourage using social media not only to post about our best moments but our quieter ones.\nWhile social media can be harmful, there are benefits that can come from it. Social media offers a safe environment and support for teenagers, which they may lack in traditional friendships. Marginalized adolescents – such as lesbian, bi, gay and transgendered teens or teenagers with disabilities – often benefit from this the most. Finding an online support group or friends who are experiencing the same thing can give them a safe channel to ask questions, express their feelings, etc.\nHow often do you talk to your teens about social media? Do you keep an eye on your teen’s online behavior?\nPhysicians\nThe Games: Putting Mental Health First", "Social Media and Teens: How Does Social Media Affect Mental Health?\nHome > Depression Central: Tell Me All I Need to Know About Depression > Teens and Depression > Social Media and Teens: How Does Social Media Affect Teenagers’ Mental Health\nSocial Media and Teens: How Does Social Media Affect Teenagers’ Mental Health\nTeenagers can use social media to find community, but their mental health is often negatively affected by this culture of comparison\nArticle by:\nKatie Hurley, LCSW\nCurrent Research The Upsides The Downsides\nThe verdict is still out on whether social media is damaging to the mental health of teens. This is in part due to the lack of research. Some studies show that online connections with small groups of people can be beneficial to teens, while other research points to a rise in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and eating disorders.\nThe other reason it’s difficult to get a good read on the issue is that social media is constantly changing and evolving. Plus, no long-term studies have been completed. So, we’re left making educated guesses based on current research. There’s just not enough data to back up the potential long-term pros and cons of living on “likes”.\nSmall Studies, Worrisome Results\nOne study out of the University of Pittsburgh, for example, found a correlation between time spent scrolling through social media apps and negative body image feedback. Those who had spent more time on social media had 2.2 times the risk of reporting eating and body image concerns, compared to their peers who spent less time on social media. The participants who spent the most time on social media had 2.6 times the risk. 1\nResults from a separate study from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine showed that the more time young adults spent on social media, the more likely they were to have problems sleeping and report symptoms of depression. 2\nAnd another small study of teens ages 13-18 from the UCLA Brain Mapping Center found that receiving a high number of likes on photos showed increased activity in the reward center of the brain. Further, teens are influenced to like photos, regardless of content, based on high numbers of likes. 3 Bottom line: It feels good to be “liked” and herd mentality is big on social media. Like what others like and you’re in.\nThe Upside of Social Media for Teens\nThere are some positive aspects to social media. It’s important to remember that teens are hardwired for socialization, and social media makes socializing easy and immediate. Teens who struggle with social skills, social anxiety, or who don’t have easy access to face-to-face socializing with other teens might benefit from connecting with other teens through social media.\nTeens in marginalized groups—including LGBTQ teens and teens struggling with mental health issues—can find support and friendship through use of social media. When teens connect with small groups of supportive teens via social media, those connections can be the difference between living in isolation and finding support.\nThe Downside Social Media Use by Teens\nRead enough of the current research and you’ll find that the negatives tend to feel bigger than the positives. While teens can use social media to connect and create friendships with others, they also confront cyberbullying, trolls, toxic comparisons, sleep deprivation, and less frequent face-to-face interactions, to name a few.\nToo much time spent scrolling through social media can result in symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Here’s how social media can be destructive:\nFocusing on likes: The need to gain “likes” on social media can cause teens to make choices they would otherwise not make, including altering their appearance, engaging in negative behaviors, and accepting risky social media challenges.\nCyberbullying: Teens girls in particular are at risk of cyberbullying through use of social media, but teen boys are not immune. Cyberbullying is associated with depression, anxiety, and an elevated risk of suicidal thoughts.\nMaking comparisons: Though many teens know that their peers share only their highlight reels on social media, it’s very difficult to avoid making comparisons. Everything from physical appearance to life circumstances to perceived successes and failures are under a microscope on social media.\nHaving too many fake friends: Even with privacy settings in place, teens can collect thousands of friends through friends of friends on social media. The more people on the friend list, the more people have access to screenshot photos, Snaps, and updates and use them for other purposes. There is no privacy on social media.\nLess face time: Social interaction skills require daily practice, even for teens. It’s difficult to build empathy and compassion (our best weapons in the war on bullying) when teens spend more time “engaging” online than they do in person. Human connection is a powerful tool and builds skills that last a lifetime.\nThere’s a happy medium in here somewhere. The key to helping teens learn to balance social media with real life friendships is to keep the lines of communication open and keep talking. Honest communication shows your teen that you are there to support, not to judge or lecture. It’s also important to walk the walk. Disconnect on weekends and show your teen that there is a whole world out there that doesn’t require a handheld screen.  She may miss her phone a lot less than she thinks she will and this is a very good lesson to learn.\nArticle Sources\nLast Updated: Nov 16, 2020", "Newsela - Negative, positive effects of excessive social media use on teens studied\nNegative, positive effects of excessive social media use on teens studied\nResearchers and scientists are trying to figure out how social media use affects young people. So far, the evidence is mixed. Photo by: MCT\nBy Baltimore Sun, adapted by Newsela staff\nPublished: 06/14/2017\nWord Count: 843\nDr. Drew Pate is an expert on the mental and emotional health of teenagers. Whenever he speaks to teen patients or their parents, one question always arises: Is social media bad for teens?\nParents wonder if their children's constant use of Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat is healthy. Teenagers talk about the pressure to post the perfect photo or to compete with the perfect lives their friends present on the Internet.\nDoctors are hearing more and more about the damage being caused by social media, said Pate. Almost any teen involved in social media has probably been harmed by it in some way, he said.\nEvidence Mixed On Social Media's Influence On Teens\nResearchers and scientists are still trying to figure out how social media use affects young people. So far, the evidence is mixed.\nStudies have shown the around-the-clock world of social media takes a mental and emotional toll on some young people. It has been linked to increased worrying and feelings of depression.\nDepression is more serious than sadness. It can feel like an inability to be happy. Depression is often caused by physical imbalances of chemicals in the brain. Sometimes, though, outside factors such as social media can affect mood and worsen depression.\nSocial media can also have a positive effect, however. For example, it can be a useful resource for teens. It can help them find social support when they are struggling with life issues, and it can provide them with a place where they can express themselves. Some teens are able to build real friendships with people they only know through social media.\nThe Negative Effects Of Too Much Use\nHowever, one recent study cast social media in a decidedly bad light. It found that the more time teens spend on social media, the more likely they are to feel depressed and have problems sleeping.\nResearchers have also found a link between social media use and poor body image, which can lead to eating disorders. A recent survey conducted by London's Royal Society for Public Health suggests that Instagram and Snapchat are the most likely to cause body-image problems among teens. Young women, in particular, are bombarded with images of perfect bodies. Many of those images are digitally edited to mask people's flaws and imperfections.\nTeenagers are already self-conscious and easily affected by what others say, said Dr. Pate. They may start comparing their lives to those of people on social media. They may think comments people make on social media are directed at them when they are not. Or, they may misinterpret what someone says.\nSocial Media Called Dangerously Addictive By Some Experts\nMany experts say social media can be dangerously addictive. Some doctors believe excessive social media use should be officially recognized as an addiction, like addiction to drugs or cigarettes.\nThe more loaded with images a social media site is, and the more rapidly content changes, \"the greater the chance of an addiction,\" said Dr. Bankole Johnson. Teens who get hooked on such forms of social media find it hard to spend too much time away from them. Their schoolwork can suffer as a result. So can their personal relationships and their moods.\nHowever, some experts warn against seeing social media as purely harmful. They point to studies that have found positive effects.\nPositive Effects For Some Young Social Media Users\nOne study found that social media helps teenagers who play video games excessively. Heavy gamers who have a network of friends on social media seem to do better than those who play the games a lot and don't have similar social networks. They seem to be less likely to experience feelings of depression and worry, said researcher Michelle Colder Carras.\nCarras said that care needs to be taken when making a direct link between mental health and social media use. She said it is not always clear whether social media is really the cause of the problem.\nThe Royal Society survey that found a link between social media use and body-image problems didn't dig deeply enough, Carras said. It didn't ask whether the teens already had mental health problems. It also didn't try to determine if those problems could have been linked to something else.\nLimiting Use Of Social Media Recommended\nThe Royal Society lists several proposals for easing the ill effects of social media. Sites like Instagram could highlight when people have digitally edited their image or post warnings about the dangers of too much social media use, the group said. It also suggested that schools teach safe social-media use.\nIn severe cases, some teens might need to give up social media completely, Dr. Pate said.\nOthers might need to be restricted to socializing with a select group of people. Parents can also help by limiting the amount of time their children spend on social media.\n\"It boils down to what the kids can manage and handle when it comes to the stress created by these sites,\" Dr. Pate said. \"We want the kids to individualize their own approach.\"", "How Social Media Causes Depression In Teens\nNWPC Blog\nHome \\ Healthcare Resources \\ Blog \\ How Social Media Addiction Affects Teenagers\nHow Social Media Addiction Affects Teenagers\nNearly 77% of all Americans have a social media profile of some kind. While Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram are designed to bring people together, the lack of interpersonal face-to-face relationships, well-curated content and pervasive cyberbullying are leaving some teenagers to feel symptoms of anxiety, depression, and isolation .\nSo, are teens who spend more time on social media more likely to suffer anxiety or depression? Recent studies have shown that teenagers do experience adverse effects like loneliness and depression when it comes to overuse and after facing instances of online bullying. To make things easier, we’re sharing new insights that cover the connections between social media overuse and how it affects mental health, along with some tips that will help parents mitigate internet addiction in teenagers.\nSocial Media and Self Esteem\nToday, 70% of teens ages 13 to 17 check their social media profiles more than once a day. Some tech-savvy teenagers are aware that plenty of people use Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and Facebook to promote a manicured portrayal of their identities. Some teens are also better than others about recognizing face-perfecting filters and can recognize staged photos as curated images versus reality. Yet, intentionally produced content, and Instagram posts of celebrities or friends appearing thinner, wealthier, happier, and more attractive, also have the effect of surfacing insecurities, anxiety and depression in vulnerable teenagers who tend to compare themselves to what they see online. These negative self-comparisons are especially prevalent in young women who are constantly inundated with images of the perfect body or lifestyle.\nAdditionally, it’s not just the onlookers that experience symptoms of depression and low self-esteem that are associated with social media addiction. Those who are adept at creating perfect images of themselves, or their lives, can also endure anxiety and fear rejection based on what they see online. They may even question if their friends genuinely like their “real” personal lives if their personalities don’t align with what they present online.\nTechnology Addiction and Decreased Physical Activity\nMany of us know the correlation between regular exercise and improved mental health. Physical activity increases brain function, helps us develop new skills, and leads to increased feelings of self-worth and personal accomplishment. Spending too much time online typically translates into less participation in physical activities that foster confidence and improves our well-being. Teens with social media addictions tend to spend more time scrolling through their online profiles and allocate less time to physical fitness, which means reduced opportunities for them to experience the mental health advantages of exercise.\nSleep Deprivation and Depression\nOne of the most common contributors to social media depression among teenagers is sleep deprivation. A recent study showed that teenagers who use social media for five hours or more daily were 70% more likely to fall asleep later or get less sleep compared to those who are online less. Sleep quality is typically inhibited or aggravated by social media addiction because teens are staying up later, blue light interferes with melatonin production, or it can create feelings of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), which can lead to anxiety and low self-worth.\nTips for Teenagers Dealing with Social Media Addiction\nWhile it’s too early to write that social media addiction directly causes depression, psychologists believe it does dramatically increase symptoms associated with it. Therefore, it’s important for parents to learn how to thoughtfully monitor their kids’ time online to help them make healthier choices. A few easy tips for limiting your teen’s social media include:\nEncourage a healthy balance of personal interactions offline and online. Get them involved in sports or other community activities that promote personal interactions and self-confidence.\nSet a timeline for phone use before bed. Ask your teenager to leave their phone out of their bedroom after a certain time.\nTurn off notifications that can distract them during homework or family time.\nReward your teen for decreasing screen time. Try treating them to their favorite dinner or take them out to the movies if they reduce their time spent online.\nHelp your kids learn about body positivity .\nTeach them how to think critically about the images or content they see online.\nNorthwest Primary Care Supports Your Family’s Mental Health\nSeek help if you notice any of the signs associated with social media depression or addiction that could increase depression and anxiety in your teenager.

Perhaps the most glaring example was the question in The Atlantic in 2017: “ Are smartphones ruining a generation? ” Responses to that article were fast and furious, ranging from “Yes, they are,” to “No, they’re not,” to “Yes they are, but not the generation you’re thinking of.”\nNew research published in the journal Clinical Psychological Science adds ammunition to the chorus of skeptical voices arguing that social media isn't as big a contributor to mental health concerns as we imagine. Using a more rigorous methodology that comes closer to allowing for inferences about cause and effect, these authors argue that we’ve got it backward. Social media use doesn’t cause depression in adolescents. Instead, it seems more likely that when teenagers (or at least teenage girls) get depressed, they spend more time on social media.\nFirst, some context. Much of the concern about young people’s engagement with social media stems from arguments made by psychologist Jean Twenge and colleagues in a recently published paper in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology. In that study, the authors documented evidence for what many took to be an alarming increase in depression and suicidality among young people. Though the study did not explicitly test a causal link between social media use and depression, Twenge strongly suggested that digital media use was behind this trend. Twenge’s claim was perhaps not surprising, given that she is the author of the book iGen: Why Today's Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy—and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood—and What That Means for the Rest of Us.\nSource: Pexels/CCO\nBut a number of critics rushed to point out that the key study in question did not provide compelling evidence that social media use is behind the increase in young people’s rates of depression. In essence, the study only demonstrated that digital media increased and rates of depression increased, but not that one trend was responsible for the other.\nAdditionally, social media use accounted for only a tiny percentage of the variability in depressive symptoms. As one research psychologist interviewed by Quartz put it, “I have the data set they used open in front of me and I submit to you that, based on that same data set, eating potatoes has the exact same negative effect on depression [as social media use].”\nFew studies on social media use have followed users over time. Instead, conclusions about the link between depression and social media use are generally based on the fact that groups who use social media more also show higher rates of depression. But myriad factors could account for those group differences — many of which may have nothing to do with social media.\nThe authors of the newly published researched addressed this limitation by using what’s called a longitudinal cross-lagged analysis. That’s a fancy way of saying that they followed adolescents and young adults over a number of years, assessing both depression and social media use multiple times. This allowed the authors to test the timing of any correlations between social media use and depression. In other words, it allowed them to address the “chicken or the egg” question: Which comes first, depression or increased social media use?\nTHE BASICS\nWhat Is Depression?\nFind a therapist to overcome depression\nFor young men and adolescent boys, the authors found no compelling evidence that social media use and depression were even associated. Given that earlier research suggested that social media is most damaging for the mental health of adolescent girls and young women, this result makes sense. But what was surprising was the finding that for adolescent girls, the data suggested that increases in depression drove increases in social media use — not the other way around. Symptoms of depression may cause adolescent girls to seek comfort or connection via social media, even if this coping strategy is unlikely to be effective.\nSource: Pexels/CC0\nThis study was not without its limitations. In particular, it did not assess what the participants were doing on social media. This is important given that, particularly for young women, photo-focused activity may play a role in increasing body image concerns in addition to negative moods.\nIt’s important to remember that science is cumulative; its foundations grow over time. Scientific research is not a winner-take-all system where one study should prompt us to disregard every other bit of work done on a topic. But it’s fair to say that this new research should cause us all to step back and think more carefully about what’s really causing increases in depression among young people.", "Does social media cause depression? - nerdsflow\nDoes social media cause depression?\nWhat researchers say about social media?\nThe term ‘Social Media’ refers to the various internet-based networks that enable users to interact with others, verbally and visually. According to Pew Research Centre (2015), at least 92% of teenagers are active on social media. Lenhart, Smith, Anderson, Duggan and Perrin identified the 13-17 age group is particularly heavy users of social media, with 87% having access to a computer and 58% to a tablet device. Almost three-quarters of adolescents aged between 15 to 17 use a smartphone, and 68% of those aged between 13 to 14.\nHow social media affecting lives?\nUnderstanding the impact of social media on adolescents well being nor become a priority due to a simultaneous increase in mental health problems. Problematic behaviours related to internet users are often described in psychiatric terminologies, such as ‘addiction’. However, some activities in younger people could be misconstrued as abnormal. For example, a young person who frequently posts images of themselves may appear narcissistic, but such behaviour has emerged as a social norm in younger people.\nThe link between social media and mental health problems is not straightforward, with various contributory factors. A report by the royal society for public health and young health movement (2017) suggested impaired sleep as a mechanism. Internet use is sedentary behaviour, which in excess raises the risk of depression, anxiety and various health problems. In young people, although the direction of this relationship is unclear: people with mental health problems may be more likely to be less physically active. Moreover, we use social media as a great way to communicate and socialize, but most of us did not realise that social media is secretly linked to depression.\nSocial media- a digital depression\nDepression is a common mood disorder that affects the way we think and feel. One of the characteristics of depression is low self-esteem and it can easily come from unrealistic body figure comparisons and harsh judgements from social media. In the last six or seven years, the depression rates have increased by about 30-40% in teenagers. Suicide rates have gone up 30% among boys, and it literally doubled, 100% increase in teenage girls. There’s no biological explanation for this massive increase in depression, anxiety and suicidality. The suggestion I’m making is there’s a cultural explanation, which is the rise of social media. According to a 2017 study by the royal society of public health indicated that Snapchat and Instagram were the two to inspire feelings of inadequacy and anxiety in the age group between 15 to 25. Seven out of ten said Instagram made them feel worse about body image and half of the age group between 14 to 20 reported Instagram and Facebook for spreading hatred and harsh comments. Studies show that depression among teens and young adults has gotten more common over the past decade. Social media use has also decreased an individual’s participation in other physical activities. Another theory is that social media is bad for teenagers’ self-esteem. Seeing lots of perfect pictures online might make kids view themselves negatively. Feeling bad about themselves can lead to depression. It can also cut into the time that kids spend with their families. It’s important for parents to check in with kids about their social media use and help them develop healthy habits.  The average teenager spends about seven hours a day on their smartphone. In general, social media is not passive anymore, it’s very interactive. So let us take a real-life example where you are texting with your friends, and sending pictures so there is someone else on the other hand. That can be good or that can be bad, if it’s a positive relationship, you might feel better. If it’s a negative relationship though it could make you feel a lot worse. So for instance, people talk about fear of missing out on an experience especially with Snapchat, Instagram where people are in real-time talking about where they are and so with teenagers or young adults the low self-esteem arises from not being invited to the party, or not being around a certain group to go out. Once, twice or three times that wouldn’t make anyone feel bad but when it’s happening every day, dozens of times and in a month hundreds of times it’s very easing to add up to reduce that person’s self-esteem.\nCelebrities away from social media\nHere’s a fact that even in the 21st century, we have some of the well-known celebrities like Scarlett Johansson, Emily Blunt, Brad Pitt and the list goes on, who do not have any social media handles which is too strange for a majority of the audience. Their perspective towards social media is not so attractive to promote their work on it and get more engagement rather they believe in a real in-person meet-ups with their audience which brings them more joy. Some don’t want to get flack for something they say, others simply don’t consider social media as their to-do goal in their life.\nHow to overcome social media\nA 2018 University of Pennsylvania study found that reducing social media use to 30mins a day resulted in a significant reduction in levels of anxiety, depression, loneliness and sleeping problems. But you don’t need to cut back on your social media use that drastically to improve your mental state. The same study concluded that just being more mindful of your social media use can have beneficial results on your mood and focus. Moreover feeling and expressing gratitude about the important things in your life can be a welcome relief to the resentment, animosity and discontent generated by social media.\nIn the end, we should spend more time with offline friends. This will also help in reducing stress and tension. Try to interact offline with friends and family and make it a regular get-together where you always keep your phones off. Reach out to your old friends and grandparents and spend some quality time with them if you haven’t done that in a while. Join a club or you can work on your hobbies and skills to keep your mind off of social media. At least you can also go on vacations to have a break from constant work and to relieve your life.\nAlso going to the park and having interaction with new people make your mind creative and active, breathing in the fresh air and doing some sort of exercise in the open sky further benefits, as of the well-known words, ” a healthy body resides a healthy mind”. Not only social media affects your mind but also your physical body because of the screen time, as people spend time in a single posture for so long which not only creates blood circulation issue but also leads to many long terms sedentary diseases like obesity.\nEND", "Are There Positives of Social Media? | Newport Academy\nHOME\nRESOURCES\nEmpowering Teens\nWhat Are the Positives of Social Media for Teens?\nWhat Are the Positives of Social Media for Teens?\nFebruary 19, 2020\nReading Time: 5 minutes\nOver the past 10-plus years, a growing body of research has revealed the negative impact of social media and technology use on teen and young adult mental health. However, a new review study suggests that these findings may be exaggerated. As a result, experts are looking at how to use the positives of social media and the plugged-in youth culture to help young people thrive.\n“As adolescents spend an increasing amount of time interacting with digital technologies, there is an urgent need to both understand effects of this usage and leverage new technologies in ways that support versus harm their mental health and well‐being,” wrote the authors of the new study, Candice L. Odgers and Michaeline R. Jensen of the University of North Carolina.\nIs Social Media Good or Bad?\nThe new analysis points out problems with the multiple studies that found few positives of social media. To cite just one recent example of research, a 2019 study by researchers at University College London tracked three years of social media and mental health statistics among 13,000 teenagers. The results showed that 27 percent of participants who frequently used social media reported high psychological stress. But among teens who used social media less frequently, only 17 percent reported high stress.\nIn fact, many researchers have theorized that the link between smartphones and mental health may help explain the escalating numbers of teens and young adults diagnosed with depression and anxiety. That’s because teen depressive symptoms and suicide rates began rapidly increasing around 2010, when smartphone use also rose precipitously.\nBut the new research review, published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry in January 2020, questions these conclusions. The review examined 40 studies on the effects of social media on teenagers. And the researchers found that the links between tech use and depression or anxiety symptoms were small and inconsistent.\nMoreover, another review, also published in January, concluded that the quality standards are low in many of the previous studies. “The association between digital technology use, or social media use in particular, and psychological well-being is—on average—negative but very small,” wrote study author Amy Orben, a researcher at the University of Cambridge.\nThe Negative Impact of Social Media and Screen Time\nWhile casting the results of previous research in doubt, the current studies don’t suggest that there are only positives of social media. Overall, both researchers and mental health experts agree that social media and tech use constitute potential detriments to teen and young adult mental health. Most important, increased smartphone use can result in any or all of the following:\nDecreased time outdoors as a result of increased screen time, depriving youth of the mental health benefits of nature\nLess physical activity, meaning young people don’t receive the psychological boost provided by exercise\nIncreased social comparison among teens and young adults who measure themselves against peers and celebrities, and therefore judge themselves wanting\nPoor body image as a consequence of social comparison\nPossible addiction to social media, smartphones, and/or video gaming, because the brain responds to digital interaction in the same way it does to drugs\nGreater likelihood of being exposed to cyberbullying and other distressing online social interactions with peers\nLack of face-to-face interaction, leading to poor social skills and less satisfying real-life relationships\nFewer hours of sleep due to social media and other tech use—important because sleep deprivation may cause or contribute to depressive symptoms.\nWhich Comes First, Depression or Tech Use?\nClearly, there are many reasons why the negatives might outweigh the positives of social media. Most experts agree that too much screen time can exacerbate depression and anxiety. But what they don’t agree on is this controversial question: Can social media and smartphone use actually cause a mental health disorder? Is technology at the root of many cases of teen and young adult depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues? Or is overuse of social media and screens a symptom of a mental health disorder? Are young people who are suffering more apt to seek out online distraction, and less motivated to engage in healthier activities?\nThe authors of the new research review, and others who have reached similar conclusions, lean toward the latter explanation. They see smartphones as reflections of mental health issues, not catalysts.\nMoreover, the discrepancy regarding the negatives and positives of social media led the American Academy of Pediatrics to revise a 2011 warning issued to healthcare providers about “Facebook depression.” Updated in 2016, the policy now includes the statement, “Research studies have identified both benefits and concerns regarding mental health and social media use.”\nHarnessing the Benefits of Social Media and Technology\nCan we use social media and other digital platforms for good? Mental health and technology experts believe that we can. Here are some of the ways that online networks and tools can support well-being.\nMental health resources: Many organizations and websites now offer support via social media for those suffering from mental health challenges. Thus, they bring people together to share experiences. One study found that patients with severe mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, used social networks as a way to feel less lonely. In addition, many sites allow people to sign up to receive texts providing inspiration, positive messages, and recovery resources.\nPositive inspiration: Social networks can create peer motivation, inspiring young people to develop healthy habits, try something new, follow their dreams, and speak up about things that matter to them.   Teens can also find positive role models online. In addition, a wide variety of apps offer instruction and support for developing a more positive outlook and building healthy habits, such as meditation and exercise.\nConnection: Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat give teens and young adults a sense of belonging and acceptance. This is particularly true for those who feel isolated or marginalized, such as LGBTQ youth and those struggling with mental health issues.\nIdentify formation: Young people who express their opinions on social media experience increased well-being, studies show. As a result of forming and expressing their opinions, they develop self-awareness and self-knowledge. This is beneficial to the maturation process and contributes to a strong sense of self.\nResearch: Another of the positives of social media is that mental health experts and researchers can use it to collect data that subsequently informs research. In addition, therapists and other professionals can network with each other within online communities, thereby expanding their knowledge and reach.\nOnline therapy: Licensed clinical professionals now provide therapeutic services via online platforms. Hence, they are able to reach young people who wouldn’t otherwise have access to mental health treatment. Furthermore, online therapy allows teens and young adults to stay on track with their recovery after leaving residential treatment or an outpatient program.\n“Technology is bringing us into a new era of mental health treatment, in which we can provide therapy and education to people who would not seek it in person, cannot afford it, or don’t live in an area where they have access to it.”\n— Jamison Monroe, Newport Academy Founder and Chairman\nIn conclusion, there’s no easy answer to questions regarding the psychological effects of cell phones on teens and young adults. But we can draw basic conclusions regarding what appear to be the most effective strategies: Use your phone less —and when you do pick it up, use social media for good.\nSources:\nJ Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2020 Jan.\nSoc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol (2020).\nLancet. 2019 Oct;3(10):685–696.\nPsychol Sci. 2016 Jul;27(7):1027–35.\nPLOS One. 2014 Oct.\nFeatured Image by Eliott Reyna on Unsplash\nArticle Image by Daan Stevens on Unsplash", "Social Media, Anxiety and Depression in Teens -\nSocial Media, Anxiety and Depression in Teens\nHome » Social Media, Anxiety and Depression in Teens\nOctober 27, 2019 by Admin\nSocial Media Affecting Teen Depression\nSocial media has become a daily method of communication even though the research consistently points to the fact that the more time we spend on social media, the more depressed we are. The level of social media-linked depression increases at an exponential rate for teens because of a lack of support structure in place, and also because the human brain still in the process of development until the age of 25, and therefore, increasingly subject to influence during these crucial formative years. In the spectrum of mental health disorders, social media as a trigger and a cause is relatively new and this phenomenon is still being studied. The United States National Institute of Health has conducted some of the most rigorous data-driven research protocols examining this very subject.\nPsychological Effects of Social Media on Youth\nThe National Institute of Health (NIH) has officially linked teen depression linked to social media use. Teens affected with social media-linked depression often describe feelings of anxiety, envy, narcissism, poor body image, loneliness and decreased social skills. These affects are cross-cultural and not linked to socio-economic status.\nSocial-media linked teen depression has become so prevalent that the NIH is currently conducting yet another research study “to understand the causes of depression, the teen brain, and evaluate new treatments. Studies enroll participants, ages 11-17, for research assessments, brain scans, talk therapy or other standard treatments.”\nHow Does Social Media Affect Self Esteem?\nSocial media’s effect on self-esteem results from:\ncomparison of self with others (usually to highly curated images not depicting “life as it is.”\nThe perception that one is being left out, also known colloquially as FOMO (fear of missing out ), a term coined specifically to describe “anxiety that an exciting or interesting event may currently be happening elsewhere, often aroused by posts seen on a social media website.”\nDr. Jennifer Rhodes terms this a paradox affect, wherein we are connected to every one of our friends on social media, and yet our reality is that we are more disconnected than ever before and less likely to venture outside of our screen for human interaction. Our online friends’ lives are depicted in such glorious and bright terms that we perceive that their lives are filled with so many options, none of which are currently available to us.\nSocial media also causes unrealistic expectations, negative body image, and addiction. Teens catch themselves comparing their physical features or daily life to people who they’re envious of, a cycle fueled by Influencers and You Tubers and which has no end in sight.\nDonna Wick, EdD, founder of Mind-to Mind Parenting, says “that for teenager’s the combined weight of vulnerability, the need for validation, and a desire to compare themselves with peers forms a perfect storm of self-doubt. She’s so thin, her grades are perfect. What a happy couple, I’ll never be that cool, that skinny, that lucky, that successful .” These thoughts often plague the mind of children who suffer from depression or anxiety.\nWhat can YOU do as a concerned parent or educator?\nSigns of Depression\nIt’s important to recognize these classic signs of depression and anxiety in teens, according to the The NIH:\nDoes my child seem irritable or sad for days? Not interested in activities that he/she usually finds fun?\nHave my child’s eating habits changed?\nDoes my child spend less time with friends?\nHas school suddenly become a struggle?\nDespite my child’s low energy, does he/she become riled up and angry easily?\nSocial-media affective depression might be classified as typical depression – there is a cause and effect, and the factors involved in each can be manipulated.\nWe also wish to share these three signs of atypical depression from Psychology Today:\nSelf-Harm\nChronic Substance Abuse\nSuicide Ideation or Attempts\nTeenage Counseling Services\nTeenage counseling services can be an excellent tool in developing skills for current and future problems. The effects will be life-long by gaining insight in self-regulation, setting boundaries, coping strategies, social skills, and self-esteem.\nTeen Therapist\nIf your teen is suffering from depression, reaching out to a licensed professional can help your child navigate their emotions and regain his/her sense of self, learn to manage time online and rebound back into a healthy dialogue with self, friends and the world around them. Teens not only need someone to hear them, they also need practical tools to help them manage their ever-shifting world.\nTeen Therapy\nSpecialized Therapy Services partner with Charter Schools in order to provide Special Education services to students. Our ERMHS (Educationally Related Mental Health Service) therapists work with students on their social-emotional goals in schools to help improve mood, learn helpful coping strategies, and increase academic success.\nFrequently Asked Questions:\nWhat is the worst social media impact on teenagers?\nTeenagers soak up the implicit messaging in social media. Every time they mindlessly scroll or even engage and comment on a thread, they recreate inner emotional landscapes saturated with judgement, fear and anxiety based on comparing their ho-hum ordinary lives with the spectacularly curated lives of their social media feed. Of all these affects, perhaps the most adverse impact social media has on teenagers is low self-esteem.\nGirls are far more likely to suffer from low self-esteem than boys. This is most likely due to the comparison factor in which girls engage– most celebrities and social media influencers are photoshopped, lit, and shot in a beautiful, exotic location. Imagine comparing yourself, post-school, sitting in your bedroom with someone so uber-fabulous, dressed in a teeny tiny bikini, laying on an exotic island. So maybe that’s a bit exaggerated, but that’s how the mind interprets things. The mind interprets different lifestyles as lack: imagine that your friend Ella posts about her uber-fabulous birthday party with baby goat yoga. Everyone is laughing, tumbling around in a goat-yoga-down-dog-fun-house in Ella’s magical backyard. Behind her is a sparkling pool and a table laid out with presents. And you’re not there. You’re not Ella. You’re not one of her friends. And therefore, you aren’t worthy. That’s how the mind works.\nIs social media affecting the minds of children? How?\nAbsolutely. Low self-esteem often leads to social isolation, poor concentration, decreased activity and sleep disruptions. Anxiety and fear lead to depression, withdrawing from life’s events and becoming more isolated than before, which leads to even more anxiety. It becomes a tumbling snowball that keeps increasing in speed and size.\nSocial media can also be a positive tool for teenagers to connect with friends and family. Parents can consider having time regulations for their children to restrict the amount of online use. Setting  parental restrictions/ boundaries for what is appropriate for your child to view, will also help regulate the negative impact on your child’s mind.\nHow is social media affecting education?\nSocial media has the potential to affect education in highly positive ways. This Georgetown University article highlights some creative techniques that teachers have used with social media to research and explore classroom issues.\nThe negative effect of prolonged social media use as a standalone activity and its relationship to education depends on the psychology of each individual. Social media might be labeled as an indirect cause, and not a direct cause and effect in terms of education. If students are distracted by their phones and aren’t paying attention to what is being taught in the classroom, of course that will affect their ability to perform. Someone who is depressed and anxious as a result of social media will withdraw from studies and friends.\nDo therapists or counselors tell parents what their children say in session?\nLegally, a child under the age of 18 years cannot consent to their own treatment (there are exceptions). The consenting parent/legal guardian has access to their child’s treatment. Clinically, it is beneficial for a teenage client to create a safe relationship with their therapist where they can share information openly. If a teenager is worried about a parent finding out the content of their session, they will often withhold information resulting in a lack of progress toward goals. Prior to initialing treatment, it is important for a therapist to discuss the expectations with the parent and teenager regarding what and how information with the parent/s is discussed.

While there are benefits to living in a digital world, there are also risks. Today’s youth miss out on critical social skills development when they spend the majority of their free time connected to and interacting through a screen. They can also get lost in a world of unrealistic comparisons, cyberbullying, and feeling left out.\nResearch shows an increase in major depressive episodes from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.3% in 2014 in adolescents and from 8.8% to 9.6% in young adults. The increase was larger and only statistically significant only in the age range of 12 to 20 years. 1 Clearly depression is on the rise among teens, the question we need to ask ourselves is how much does technology and social media contribute to it?\nIt’s no big secret that connecting via texting, Instagram, and Facebook can include harsh judgments and comparisons. It’s easier to make statements on a screen that would otherwise be difficult to verbalize face to face. And disjointed shorthand conversations can easily result in misunderstandings. It doesn’t help that digital communication occurs at a rapid pace, one that is difficult to process at times.\nOne report by the Royal Society for Public Health in the UK surveyed 1500 young people, ages 14 to 24, to determine the effects of social media use on issues such as anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and body image. Their findings show that YouTube had the most positive impact, while Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and SnapChat all had negative effects on mental health. 2\nWhile these findings might make you want to delete all social media apps and ban your teen from any digital communication, avoidance isn’t the answer. Teens use social media to connect, seek friendship and support, and even ask for help at times. A better bet is to understand how and why your teen uses social media, stay connected, and know what to look for if your teen shows unexplained emotional changes.\nSymptoms of depression\nThe defining feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least two weeks during which there is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. 3 For children, you are more likely to see irritability than depressed mood. Other symptoms of depression can include the following:\nFeelings of hopelessness\nLoss of interest in normal daily activities\nIrritable mood\nSignificant weight loss or weight gain\nDiminished self-care\nInsomnia or hypersomnia\nPsychomotor agitation or retardation\nFatigue or loss of energy\nFeelings of worthlessness\nExcessive guilt\nDifficulty concentrating\nDifficulty making decisions\nPhysical complaints: headaches, stomachaches\nSocial isolation\nRecurrent thoughts about death\nSuicidal thoughts, actions, or plans.\nThe symptoms of depression exhibited by teens are likely to negatively affect school performance (and even attendance), friendships, and family relationships. The tricky part about teen depression is that it can be gradual. Complaints of difficulty sleeping or frequent headaches seem age appropriate, and in many cases they are. They shouldn’t happen regularly, though. When your typically active and social teen appears isolated, sad, and unreachable, it’s time to get help.\nHow to help your teen navigate social media\nBelieve it or not, your teen does want your support and guidance, but it can be hard to strike a balance between helping and trying to fix everything. Follow these tips to support your teen:\nAsk questions\nTeens need autonomy in their lives, so micromanaging their online use can backfire. The best thing parents can do is engage with their teens. Ask which apps your teen uses the most often and why. Give your teen the space to tell you about the benefits of social media.\nWhen difficult situations arise online, either in the news or in your teen’s life, as your teen how she or he would handle it. What can teens do to make social media a more positive experience?\nModel appropriate behavior\nModeling is very important during adolescence. Teens are confronted with new and confusing information almost daily. Growing up in the digital age is no easy task. When parents follow their own rules and stick to their own boundaries, teen learn important lessons in self-care and setting limits.\nWhen teens begin to internalize the importance of limits and boundaries, they can set limits with their peers. This is an important life skill that is sometimes overlooked when teens are stressed, busy, and constantly connected.\nTalk often\nParents play a critical role in helping teens process and cope with what they’re seeing online. Talk about your own experiences with social media. Have you ever experienced envy when scrolling through your feed? Have you accepted a friend request that turned out to be a fake profile because you didn’t take the time to look? When parents share their own experiences and talk openly about the highs and lows of social media, teens are more likely to open up about their experiences.\nParents can also help teens broaden their social media experiences by talking about interesting Instagram accounts, Twitter feeds, or Facebook pages that share information about certain topics. It’s too easy for teens to get stuck on the treadmill of social comparisons when engaged with social media. Guiding them toward their areas of interest using social media helps them expand their experiences and learn new things.\nConnection is key when it comes to parenting teens in a modern world. The single best thing you can do for your teen is make time for face-to-face connections and simply be present.\nLast Updated: Mar 8, 2021", "Does Social Media Cause Depression? | Wundef.com\nDoes Social Media Cause Depression?\nBy: Charles Wundengba\nDate:\nNovember 13, 2019\nIs using social media making people unhappy? Evidence is mounting that there is a link between social media and depression. In several recent studies, teenage and young adult users who spend the most time on Instagram, Facebook and other platforms were shown to have a substantially (from 13 to 66 percent) higher rate of reported depression than those who spent the least time.\nDoes that mean that Instagram and Facebook are actually causing depression? These studies show a correlation, not causation. But it’s worth a serious look at how social media could be affecting teenagers and young adults negatively.\nOne reason the correlation seems more than coincidental is that an increase in depression occurred in tandem with the rise in smartphone use.\nA 2017 study of over half a million eighth through 12th graders found that the number exhibiting high levels of depressive symptoms increased by 33 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same period, the suicide rate for girls in that age group increased by 65 percent.\nSmartphones were introduced in 2007, and by 2015 fully 92 percent of teens and young adults owned a smartphone. The rise in depressive symptoms correlates with smartphone adoption during that period, even when matched year by year, observes the study’s lead author, San Diego State University psychologist Jean Twenge.\nOver that same time period there was a sharp spike in reports of students seeking help at college and university counseling centers, principally for depression and anxiety. Visits jumped 30 percent between 2010 and 2015.\nSocial media and depression\nOne of the biggest differences in the lives of current teenagers and young adults, compared to earlier generations, is that they spend much less time connecting with their peers in person and more time connecting electronically, principally through social media.\nSome experts see the rise in depression as evidence that the connections social media users form electronically are less emotionally satisfying, leaving them feeling socially isolated.\n“The less you are connected with human beings in a deep, empathic way, the less you’re really getting the benefits of a social interaction,” points out Alexandra Hamlet, PsyD, a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute. “The more superficial it is, the less likely it’s going to cause you to feel connected, which is something we all need.”\nIndeed, one exception to the depression correlation is girls who are high users of social media but also keep up a high level of face-to-face social interaction. The Twenge study showed that those girls who interact intensely offline as well as through social media don’t show the increase in depressive symptoms that those who interact less in person do.\nAnd there are some teenagers who aren’t successful in connecting with peers offline, because they are isolated geographically or don’t feel accepted in their schools and local communities. For those kids, electronic connection can be lifesaving.\nSocial media and perceived isolation\nAnother study last year of a national sample of young adults (age 19-32) showed correlation between the time spent on social media and perceived social isolation (PSI). The authors noted that directionality can’t be determined. That is, “Do people feeling socially isolated spend more time on social media, or do more intense users develop PSI?”\nIf it’s the latter, they noted, “Is it because the individual is spending less time on more authentic social experiences that would decrease PSI? Or is it the nature of observing highly curated social feeds that they make you feel more excluded?”\nWhich brings us what we now call FOMO, or fear of missing out.\nJerry Bubrick, PhD, a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute, observes that “FOMO is really the fear of not being connected to our social world, and that need to feel connected sometimes trumps whatever’s going on in the actual situation we’re in. The more we use social media, the less we think about being present in the moment.”\nInstead we might be occupied with worrying why we weren’t invited to a party we’re seeing on Instagram, or making sure we don’t miss a single post from a friend. But if we’re always playing catch-up to endless online updates, we’re prioritizing social interactions that aren’t as emotionally rewarding and can actually make us feel more isolated.\nSocial media and self-esteem\nAnother theory about the increase in depression is the loss of self-esteem, especially in teenage girls, when they c ompare themselves negatively with artfully curated images of those who appear to be prettier, thinner, more popular and richer.\n“Many girls are bombarded with their friends posting the most perfect pictures of themselves, or they’re following celebrities and influencers who do a lot of Photoshopping and have makeup and hair teams,” explains Dr. Hamlet. “If that’s their model for what is normal, it can be very hard on their self-confidence.”\nIndeed, image-driven Instagram shows up in surveys as the platform that most leads young people to report feeling anxiety, depression and worries about body image.\nCuration of a perfect image may not only make others feel inadequate, it’s unhealthy even for those who appear to be successful at it, notes Dr. Bubrick. “Kids spend so much time on social media trying to post what they think the world will think is a perfect life. Look at how happy I am! Look how beautiful I am! Without that they’re worried that their friends won’t accept them. They’re afraid of being rejected.” And if they are getting positive feedback from their social media accounts, they might worry that what their friends like isn’t the “real” them.\nLess healthy activity\nAnother possible source of depression may be what teenagers are not doing during while they’re spending time on social media, including physical activity and things that generate a sense of accomplishment, like learning new skills and developing talents.\n“If you’re spending a lot of time on your phone, you have less time for activities that can build confidence, a sense of achievement and connectedness,” explains Dr. Hamlet.\nKids who are spending a lot of time on devices are not getting much in return to make them feel good about themselves, she adds. “Yes, you get a little dopamine burst whenever you get a notification, or a like on a picture, or a follow request. But those things are addicting without being satisfying.”\nDisrupted concentration\nAnother thing disrupted by social media is the process of doing homework and other tasks that require concentration. It’s become common for teenagers to engage with friends on social media at the same time they are studying. They take pride in being able to multi-task, but evidence shows that it cuts down on learning and performance.\n“Basically, multitasking isn’t possible,” Dr. Hamlet notes. “What you end up doing is really just switching back and forth between two tasks rather quickly. There is a cost to the brain.” And with poorer concentration and constant interruption, homework takes substantially longer than it should, cutting into free time and adding to stress.\nSleep deprivation and depression\nSome of the ways in which social media use impacts mood may be indirect. For instance, one of the most common contributors to depression in teenagers is sleep deprivation, which can be caused, or exacerbated, by social media.\nResearch shows that 60 percent of adolescents are looking at their phones in the last hour before sleep, and that they get on average an hour less sleep than their peers who don’t use their phones before bed. Blue light from electronic screens interferes with falling asleep; on top of that, checking social media is not necessarily a relaxing or sleep-inducing activity. Scrolling on social media, notes Dr. Hamlet, can easily end up causing stress.\n“Social media can have a profound effect on sleep,” adds Dr. Bubrick. “You have the intention to check Facebook or Instagram for 5 minutes, and the next thing you know 50 minutes are gone. You’re an hour behind in sleep, and more tired the next day. You find it harder to focus. You’re off your game, and it spirals from there .”\nHow to minimize negative effects of social media use\nWhile we don’t yet have conclusive evidence that social media use actually causes depression, we do have plenty of warning signs that it may be affecting our kids negatively. So it’s smart for parents to check in regularly with kids about their social media use, to make sure it’s positive and healthy, and guide them towards ways to change it, if you think it’s not.\nAlso, be alert for symptoms of depression.  If you notice signs that your child might be depressed, take them seriously. Ask your child how he is doing, and don’t hesitate to set up an appointment with a mental health provider.\nSteps you can take to insure healthy social media use:\nFocus on balance: Make sure your kids are also engaging in social interaction offline, and have time for activities that help build identity and self-confidence.\nTurn off notifications: App developers are getting more and more aggressive with notifications to lure users to interrupt whatever they’re doing to engage constantly with their phones. Don’t let them.\nLook out for girls at higher risk of depression: Monitor girls who are going through a particularly tough time or are under unusual stress. Negative effects of social media can have more impact when confidence is down.\nTeach mindful use of social media : Encourage teenagers to be honest with themselves about how time spent on social media makes them feel, and disengage from interactions that increase stress or unhappiness.\nModel restraint and balance in your own media diet: Set an example by disengaging from media to spend quality family time together, including phone-free dinners and other activities. Kids may resist, but they’ll feel the benefits.\nPhone-free time before sleep: Enforce a policy of no smartphones in the bedroom after a specific time and overnight.

Some argue this difference is morally significant because PAS requires \"firmer resolve\" from the patient and provides more protection against coercion [3].\n\n## Arguments FOR Legalization\n\n### Individual Autonomy and Self-Determination\n- The \"ultimate civil right\" argument: mentally competent, terminally ill people should control their own death [7]\n- Respect for personal autonomy and the right to make intimate decisions about one's own life [1]\n- Freedom from being forced to live against one's will when facing unbearable suffering [7]\n\n### Compassionate Relief\n- Provides \"insurance policy\" ensuring no one dies in painful agony [7]\n- Allows terminally ill patients to die with dignity rather than in degrading circumstances [10]\n- Eliminates fear of becoming a financial burden on families [10]\n\n### Practical Considerations\n- Doctors already practice it covertly; legalization would provide oversight and protection [7]\n- Similar to existing pain management practices that may hasten death [7]\n- Relatively inexpensive compared to prolonged medical care [7]\n\n## Arguments AGAINST Legalization\n\n### Slippery Slope Concerns\n- Fear that legalized killing could expand to disabled, elderly, and mentally incompetent people [7]\n- The Dutch experience cited as evidence of expanding criteria over time [7]\n- Risk that economic pressures could promote euthanasia as cost containment [7]\n\n### Medical Ethics and Professional Role\n- Conflicts with the Hippocratic Oath's prohibition against giving deadly drugs [1]\n- Violates the physician's fundamental duty to \"care, never to kill\" [1]\n- Puts excessive power in doctors' hands, creating potential for abuse [10]\n\n### Religious and Moral Objections\n- Life is viewed as a sacred gift that only God should end [8]\n- Catholic teaching emphasizes stewardship rather than absolute dominion over life [10]\n- Violates the principle of sanctity of life across many religious traditions [1]\n\n## Cultural and Western Perspectives\n\n### Cross-Cultural Variations\nResearch shows significant cultural differences in acceptance [1]:\n- **Religious influence**: More religious countries have lower public acceptance [9]\n- **Regional patterns**: Western, secular countries show higher acceptance than religious or Eastern Orthodox regions [9]\n- **Historical factors**: Germans remain less accepting due to Nazi associations; Eastern Europeans show less opinion formation due to Soviet regime history [9]\n\n### Legal Status by Region\n- **Netherlands and Belgium**: Legalized euthanasia in 2002 with strict guidelines [1]\n- **Switzerland**: De facto legalization (unpunishable unless selfish motives proven) [1]\n- **United States**: Oregon (1997), Washington (2009), and Montana allow physician-assisted suicide [1]\n- **Australia**: Northern Territory briefly legalized it (1995-1997) before federal override [1]\n\n### Cultural Acceptance Factors\nStudies identify that more accepting individuals tend to be [9]:\n- Males\n- Higher educated\n- Higher social class\n- Younger generation\n- Weaker religious beliefs\n\n## Moral Justifications: Both Sides\n\n### Pro-Legalization Moral Framework\n- **Utilitarian ethics**: Minimizing suffering and maximizing well-being [2]\n- **Rights-based ethics**: Fundamental right to self-determination and bodily autonomy [2]\n- **Dignity principle**: Preserving human dignity by avoiding degrading end-of-life conditions [10]\n\n### Anti-Legalization Moral Framework\n- **Sanctity of life**: Life has intrinsic value regardless of circumstances [8]\n- **Natural law**: Allowing natural death processes without artificial intervention [1]\n- **Social responsibility**: Protecting vulnerable populations from potential exploitation [7]\n\n## Contemporary Debate Considerations\n\nThe debate increasingly focuses on four key arguments [9]:\n1. **Religious concerns** about the sanctity of life\n2. **Slippery slope** fears about expanding criteria\n3. **Autonomy rights** of individuals to control their death\n4. **Death with dignity** as a humanitarian concern\n\nModern medicine's ability to prolong life has intensified these debates, as has the aging population in Western countries.

(Rengetsu, a Buddhist nun)\nAbstract: This chapter compares perspectives on euthanasia and physician assisted suicide within countries as well as between countries. Several indigenous perspectives on euthanasia are contrasted with those of mainstream Western religion and medicine, both of which consider euthanasia and assisted suicide to be in conflict with their ethnical principles. Religious differences have emerged in research studies; Jewish participants are more likely than those from other groups to support physician assisted suicide, and Muslims are less likely to trust the health care system than were members of other religious groups. In spite of secular and ecclesiastical rejection of euthanasia and assisted suicide, several jurisdictions, including the state of Oregon in the United States, have permitted either or both. The Netherlands has guidelines for euthanasia and physician assisted suicide, while these practices have a de facto status in Switzerland, Belgium, and Colombia. In the U.S., the Compassion and Choices group urges its members to complete a “living will” and “power of attorney” for health care, both of which give members, or those who they designate, to control the time and manner of their death. At the academic and medical level, these developments impact the field of bioethics; at the public level, they have become part of the discourse between fundamentalist members of Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Muslim congregations on the one hand, and Unitarian-Universalist, liberal Protestant, and secular humanist groups on the other hand. As a result this topic has become a player as well as a pawn in the so-called “culture wars” that characterize both peaceful and conflictual diversity in the 21st century. This chapter exemplifies how the anthropology of consciousness can offer cross-cultural perspectives on conventionally “taboo” topics, e.g. death and dying, to deepen and perhaps advance discourse and policy based on humanitarian concerns.\nIntroduction\nAs an emerging discipline, the anthropology of consciousness can not escape the investigation of cultural myths and practices concerning death and dying. One set of beliefs and procedures is especially pertinent in the contemporary world, namely euthanasia and physician assisted suicide (Gustafsson, 2007; Kleinman, 1988; Krippner, 1989). Western medicine has prolonged human life, but its practitioners typically ignore discussing the end of life with their patients. In the meantime, there is a small group of physicians who are attempting to respond to the desires of some terminally ill or severely disabled patients that their wish to terminate their lives be honored.\nIn preparing this article, we used the American Humanist Association’s 1974 definition of “euthanasia” as “a mode of act of ending or permitting death painlessly as a relief from suffering.” The English word “euthanasia” is derived from the Greek words “eu” and “thanatos,” literally, “dying well.” The Hippocratic Oath, required from Greek physicians and dating back to the 3rd century B.C.E., states “To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug or give advice that may induce death.” Even so, physician assisted suicide was not uncommon in Greece and Rome, and was actively promoted by the Stoics and Epicureans whose philosophy condoned euthanasia for those whose terminal illness resulted in unbearable suffering.\nTracing the history of physician assisted suicide and other forms of euthanasia (i.e., death assisted by non-physicians or by gravely ill persons themselves) was conducted by archival research. Material from books and journals in our own libraries was supplemented by means of internet searches using such search engines as google.com, questia.com, and yahoo.com to obtain data in regards to the contemporary debate, with an emphasis on cross-cultural perspectives. We delimited our thesis for this chapter to identifying the diverse ways in which national, religious, and ethnic groups respond to the issue of euthanasia; such theses as ethical issues, historical development, and psychological motivations are worthwhile candidates for other essays. We have not focused on the issue of life after death, a topic that has been dealt with from various perspectives (e.g., Braude, 2005; O’Kelly, 2006).\nHistorical Perspectives\nSeveral indigenous tribes practiced euthanasia before their lands were colonized. For example, the Caribs practiced euthanasia on the grounds that the terminally ill were possessed by evil spirits and the longer these people clung on to life, the more powerful the malevolent spirits would become, endangering the safety of the community. The Caribs were cannibals, but only ate healthy war captives, especially young boys who were fattened up for the feast. The sick and the infirm were not cannibalized for fear that wicked entities would enter their bodies.\nAmong a number of other indigenous people, euthanasia was practiced for a number of reasons as well, both as a type of population control during times of hunger and famine, and as an act of mercy. The Kalinago inhabitants of the island of Grenada transported the aged and the terminally ill into the afterlife with the aid of herbal poisons, convinced that they were sparing the infirm debilitating inconveniences and pain (Honychurch, 2002).\nCurrently (as of 2008), euthanasia and physician assisted suicide are opposed by mainstream Western medicine, as expressed by The World Medical Association, and by all large religious institutions, as articulated by the Lutheran Church’s Missouri Synod and by Pope John Paul II in 1995 on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church. Islam is slightly more moderate, holding that the life of gravely ill people should be ended “only when absolutely necessary” (Johnson & McGee, 1986/1991).\nHowever, in The Netherlands, since the 1970s, these practices are not punishable, provided that they have been committed by a physician who met certain care requirements. Canada gives its terminally ill citizens the right to refuse medication, intravenous feeding, or so-called “heroic” interventions that would prolong their lives (but, presumably, at the cost of prolonged pain and suffering).. In 1995, Australia’s Northern Territory became the first jurisdiction worldwide to legalize suicide and euthanasia for the terminally ill, whereby patients could facilitate their own death through a computerized process. In 1996, Philip Nitschke became the first physician to provide legal voluntary euthanasia under the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. However, the Federal Parliament soon overturned this legislation even though three people had been voluntarily euthanasized by Nitschke, and four seriously ill people had voluntarily ended their lives before the Australian Parliament aborted the activity.\nThe Belgian Parliament legalized euthanasia in 2002, specifically for competent adults and emancipated minors. Furthermore, supported by the Association for the Right to Die with Dignity, a Belgian pharmaceutical company announced the development of “home euthanasia kits” in 2005. In Switzerland, euthanasia cannot be prosecuted, assuming no selfish motive is exhibited on the part of the physician. In Great Britain, the Dying with Dignity society argues for euthanasia as a relief of terminal illness, despite some government opposition.\nIn the United States, the philanthropist George Soros initiated the “Death in America” project to support the legalization of euthanasia and physician assisted suicide. Two highly publicized cases of physician assisted suicide in 2005 were those of Haileigh Young and Terry Schiavo. The Compassion and Choices organization in the United   States, formerly known as the Hemlock Society, supports giving its members the right to control the time and manner of their death. This society supported Oregon’s 1997 law, upheld by the Supreme Court, to allow physicians to prescribe lethal drugs to terminally ill patients who want to end their lives. They also have organized movements to oppose legislation in half the states in America that would prohibit physician assisted suicide.\nAs an aging population continues to grow worldwide, governments and public opinion leaders will need to address this issue in a responsible manner, facing ethical issues on which there is no clear-cut consensus (Rosenbaum & Baird, 1989). While most religious institutions oppose euthanasia, a number of spiritual and activist groups stress the importance of the quality of life, not its duration. Even here, there is no unanimity as evidenced by such groups as the Atheist and Agnostics Pro-Life League, Feminists for Life of America, the Pro-Life Alliance of Gays and Lesbians, Jews for Life, Libertarians for Life, Citizens United Opposing Euthanasia, and the International Anti-Euthanasia Task Force. Some of these organizations also oppose abortion, while others do not take a position on the issue.\nIn addition, some advocates support passive euthanasia (in which a physician or other person withholds a surgical procedure or an antibiotic or other vital medication) but reject active euthanasia (the administration of a toxic substance or the initiation of suffocation or other fatal procedure). Finally, many advocates of animal euthanasia would not extend the practice to humans whose dire medical situation is similar. Anthropologists can advance discourse and policy regarding this issue by making cross-cultural comparisons and by identifying indigenous practices that may be relevant to the contemporary debate.\nBioethics\nEuthanasia and physician assisted suicide are examples of topics discussed in the field of “bioethics,” a term introduced in the United States in the early 1970s, and one that spread rapidly to other countries. The field covers a wide range of topics, from organ transplants to cloning. Writers from non-EuroAmerican cultures comprehend that any approach to bioethics should be based on specific cultural traditions, which vary from culture to culture (Sakamoto, 1995). Even within any given country, there are divergences of opinion; in Japan, some individuals believe that brain-death defines the cessation of life, while others believe that the circulation of blood is the defining criteria (Morioka, 1995). Therefore, this chapter will compare perspectives on euthanasia and assisted suicide within countries as well as between countries. Given the controversial nature of these topics and the clashing views involved, a deeper exploration of the beliefs and practices among various cultures can help provide a greater understanding, and promote a dialogue between these differing viewpoints, even though reconciliation is hardly realistic.\nMainstream Western religion and medicine consider euthanasia and assisted suicide to be in conflict with their ethical principles. For example, the World Medical Association (whose membership includes the American Medical Association) has adopted resolutions condemning both practices. This group has urged all medical associations and their members to refrain from practicing euthanasia and assisted suicide even if national laws are not prohibitive.\nIn 2002 the World Medical Association adopted a resolution that stated, “Euthanasia, that is the act of deliberately ending the life of a patient, even at the patient’s own request or at the request of close relatives, is unethical….Physician assisted suicide, like euthanasia, is unethical and must be condemned by the medical profession.” But the same resolution makes an exception: “This does not prevent the physician from respecting the desire of a patient to allow the natural process of death to follow its course in the terminal phase of sickness.” In addition, “The right to decline medical treatment is a basic right of the patient and the physician does not act unethically even if respecting such a wish results in the death of a patient.”\nIn the United States, a 1976 study based on data from 36 different focus groups found that Americans in general shared similar values, opinions, and concerns about death and dying. Focus group members expressed their desire for a humane, compassionate process for dying that would allow them as much control as possible over what happens at the end of their lives. However, ethnicity appeared to shape the few differences that resulted from the survey. For example, African American and Native American focus group participants were somewhat more reluctant to support physician assisted suicide than other ethnic groups. Moreover, African Americans and Native Americans were less likely to believe that decisions should differ for elderly patients in comparison with young patients. Euro-American and Asian American participants were more likely to place trust in the health care system than were Native American, African American, or Latino and Latina participants. African American participants were the most likely to indicate that a lesser quality of life would be acceptable to them if their lives were saved (Kalish & Reynolds, 1976).\nThere were also some religious differences that emerged; Jewish participants were more likely than those from other groups to support physician assisted suicide, and Muslims were less likely to trust the health care system than were members of other religious groups. Age had even less of a bearing than ethnicity or religious background; however, participants between the ages of 18 and 24 were more likely to support physician assisted suicide and less likely to trust the health care system (Kalish & Reynolds, 1976). These ethnic differences are in accord with anthropological data on minority groups in the United States; as “outsiders,” Muslims (both African American Muslims and those with roots in the Middle  East) are less likely to trust any system that reflects the power structure that has marginalized them. The same can be said for African American, Native American, and Latino/Latina participants, all of whom lacked trust in a “system” run by Euro-Americans, and one to which Asian Americans have accommodated surprisingly well. Jewish participants in the study were more likely to support physician assisted suicide, reflecting the diversity of American Jews (many of whom are not members of either the Orthodox, Conservative, or Reform congregations). Younger U.S. participants tend to question authority, no matter what the topic; those African Americans who would settle for “a lesser quality of life” may have had dealt with survival issues themselves or recall their ancestors’ attempts to survive during the years of slavery, when their life or death was dependent on the whim of their slave masters. I other words, it is essential that ethnic differences be taken into consideration before any sweeping generalizations are made regarding a country’s attitudes on life and death issues (Parkes, 1997).\nA Report of the Commission on Theology and Church Relations of the Lutheran  Church’s Missouri Synod (Advocates for Better Care, 1993) rejected, on “scriptural” grounds, claims that euthanasia and assisted suicide were “compassionate acts,” insisting that “Christians aim always to care, never to kill.” However, the Commission noted that the administration of pain-killing medications, “even at the risk of shortening life” was permissible “since this does not entail the choice of death as either a means or an end.” Moreover, physicians were allowed to request and receive a patient’s statement, or one signed by the nearest of kin, consenting to the uselessness of “heroic efforts” and consenting to the termination of treatments.\nIn 1987 a coalition of conservative Protestant groups, the Fundamental Bible Churches stated their objection to the direction taken by the World Council of Churches (WCC) at their Vancouver assembly, a trend the coalition claimed was “evident” since the WCC’s Uppsala, Sweden assembly in 1968. The coalition stated that the WCC’s strong warnings against the nuclear threat to human life “is inconsistent with the apparent negligence of the millions of human lives sacrificed yearly through the toleration of legal abortion, and of the many other lives which will be sacrificed as the consequence of the increasing demand to introduce euthanasia.” Many evangelical and fundamentalist Protestant churches are not members of the WCC, taking exception to its stand on such issues as family planning, abortion, and – in select cases – the consideration of euthanasia.\nIn 1995, Pope John Paul II, in the Encyclical Evangelium Vitae, pronounced, by the authority that Christ conferred upon Peter and his successors, and in communion with the bishops of the Catholic Church, I confirm that the direct and voluntary killing of an innocent human being is always gravelyimmoral…, whether a fetus or an embryo, an infant or an adult, an old person, or one suffering from an incurable disease, or a person who is dying. Furthermore, no one is permitted to ask for the act of killing, either for himself or herself or for another person entrusted to his or her care, nor can he or she consent to it, either explicitly or implicitly, nor can any authority legitimately recommend or permit such an action.\nThis encyclical left no doubt that papal doctrine is completely opposed to both euthanasia and assisted suicide (Kurtz, 2006).\nThis perspective resembles the position of Kardec Spiritism, as practiced throughout Latin  America. Allan Kardec, a French educator, wrote several books about\n“spirits” and “mediums” in the 19th century; these books have become the basis for an international movement, most notably in Brazil. The Spiritist medium Divaldo Franco (2006) wrote that euthanasia “constitutes a heinous crime.” But Spiritist doctrine differs from Catholic doctrine in that it attributes long-term agony to “past-life actions” (p. 10). Euthanasia interrupts the “process of adjustment” and “atonement” that is needed for the individual’s next “incarnation” (p. 11).\nIn 2000, after a three-year discussion that covered such areas as ethics, theology, and pastoral care, the Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Council of Churches voted to oppose legalized physician assisted suicide. The 40-member board consisted of clergy and lay representatives of 15 of the state’s Protestant denominations as well as representatives from Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions.\nIn 1976, the Greek Orthodox Church issued an encyclical calling euthanasia “a moral abomination,” but also distinguished “between euthanasia and the withholding of extraordinary means to prolong life” (Harakas, 2005). However, in spite of this secular and ecclesiastical rejection of euthanasia and assisted suicide, several jurisdictions, including the state of Oregon in the United States, have permitted either or both. We will make several cross-cultural comparisons to demonstrate those differences.\nThe Netherlands\nPhysicians in the Netherlands have practiced both physician assisted suicide and euthanasia since about 1973, although theses practices remained technically illegal until 2002. Between those years, a series of court decisions and medical association guidelines led to an action of the Dutch Parliament stating that euthanasia and assisted suicide were not punishable if they have been “committed by a physician who has met the requirements of due care” described in the Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide Act, and if they have informed the municipal authorities in accordance with the Burial and Cremation Act.\nThe events leading up to this legislation was stimulated by a 1973 district court case in which Geertruida Postma, a Dutch physician, was convicted of a crime after she ended the life of her seriously ill mother by lethal injection. Postma made her action public, hoping that it would stimulate public opinion and legal reconsideration of the laws against assisted suicide and euthanasia. Ordinarily, Postma’s crime would have resulted in a jail term of up to 12 years; nevertheless, the court imposed a one-week suspended sentence and a week’s probation following testimony by the district medical inspector who set forth certain conditions under which euthanasia should be considered “acceptable.” Other cases followed, each widening the boundaries and further liberalizing the conditions under which euthanasia and assisted suicide would not be punished.\nUnder this legislation that was adopted in 2002, minors between 16 and 18 years of age may request that physicians terminate their lives and, although parents and guardians may be consulted, they have no authority to prevent the requested death. However, a parent or guardian must approve of requests from children between the ages of 12 and 15 who make such an appeal. In addition, the law recognizes the right of a physician to carry out euthanasia based on a written advance request for death of a current incapacitated person who is 16 years or older. There is no requirement that the person must be at least 16 when the request is put into writing.\nAccording to the Dutch government, physicians had been reluctant to report their death-inducing activities. According to the Dutch government, the primary reason for adopting the 2002 law was to bring matters into the open, to apply uniform criteria in assessing every case in which a physician terminates life, and to ensure that maximum care is exercised in such cases. In reality, however, many physicians objected to the many provisions of this law and it is likely that the actual number of physician induced deaths was under-reported. In the meantime, a university medical center in the Netherlands issued a report that it had been euthanizing infants, not only in the case of terminally ill newborns but also in the case of children born with spinal bifida and other severe disabilities. The medical center noted that its practice was in accord with the local cultural standards but was not necessarily transferable to other countries.\nIn 2005, survey results were published reporting responses of 3,614 general practitioners in the Netherlands. Of the explicit assisted suicide requests, 44% were granted by general practitioners, 13% died before the physicians could end their lives, 13% died before the physicians had made their final decisions, 12% of the requests were refused, and 13% of the patients changed their minds after the request had been granted. The total number of reported cases of legal anesthesia was 1,933 in 2005 (International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide, 2005).\nThe three most compelling reasons given by the patients whose requests were granted included “pointless suffering,” “loss of dignity,” and “constant weakness.” Among those whose requests were denied, the most common reasons given by patients were “I do not want to be a burden,” “I am tired of living,” and “I suffer from depression.” A critic of the study noted that the physicians surveyed were chosen because they did not have a negative attitude toward euthanasia; hence, the survey might not be representative of all Dutch physicians (Jan-van der Weide, et al., 2005).\nAustralia\nIn 1995, with the passage of the “Rights of the Terminally Ill Act,” Australia’s Northern Territory became the first jurisdiction in the world with both legalized assisted suicide and euthanasia. The law went into effect in 1996 but was repealed in 1997 when the national Parliament repealed the act. Under Australian law, the national government can review and repeal a Northern Territory Act if it is seen as conflicting with national interests. Groups as diverse as the Australian Medical Association and Australian aboriginal communities had opposed the legislation and supported the repeal; the latter group expressed concern that the procedure would deter aborigines from seeking prompt medical attention.\nA deeper examination of the beliefs and practices of Aborigines illustrates how, for the Aborigines, birth and death were great mysteries involving supernatural beings. Therefore, if an Aborigine were taken ill and became close to death, he or she may reason that this was the will of those supernatural being. Further, the Eora/Dharawal Aborigines believed in transmigration or transmutation, e.g. warriors became dolphins in a subsequent incarnation. Animals were viewed as “their brothers” and David Collins (2007) noted one instance in which an Aborigine stood in the line of fire to protect the life of his “brother” when a European hunter wanted to kill a raven. Aborigines, as a rule, do not fear death and perceive themselves as so connected to the world of nature that they are willing to sacrifice their individual lives. However, their preference is to keep this practice under control rather than relegating it to a Western-trained physician unfamiliar with their traditions (http://www.crystalinks.com/aboriginals2.html).\nDuring the four months which the law was in effect, four assisted deaths occurred under its provisions. The same physician facilitated all four deaths by means of a computer attached by plastic tubing to a pump-driven syringe filled with barbiturates. After the patient was attached to an intravenous line connected with the computer, three questions appeared on the computer screen:\n1. Are you aware that if you go ahead to the last screen and press the “yes” button, you will be given a lethal dose of medicine and die? Yes/No.\n2. Are you certain you understand that if you proceed and press the “yes” button on the next screen, you will die? Yes/No.\n3. In 15 seconds, you will be given a lethal injection. Yes/No.\nChecking “yes” for each of the three questions activated a syringe driver and a sequential delivery of barbiturates. The physician, therefore, did not directly administer the lethal dose. The physician noted that the procedure was inexpensive since patents paid about $100.00 (U.S.) for the drugs; the cost of the consultations was paid for under the Australian Medicare System.\nEven after the repeal of the Act, an international organization, Compassion and Choices, worked with physicians to develop a “drawstring” device that people could put over their heads to commit suicide using carbon monoxide. So-called “peaceful pills” will also be available should Australian legislation change in the future.\nColombia\nColombia is the only Latin American country where euthanasia is not outlawed. The practice became permissible in 1997 when the Constitutional Court, Colombia’s highest judicial body, ruled that individuals may choose to end their lives and that physicians can not be prosecuted for their assistance. The ruling came in response to a case in which an opponent of euthanasia had tried to outlaw the practice. The court urged the Colombian Congress to codify the practice in order to prevent abuses, but legislators refused to do so, given the emotionally charged debate in a country that is predominantly Roman Catholic. Proponents of the legislation have proposed legislation that would compel physicians to obtain a second opinion, administer psychological and medical tests to patients, and have each case reviewed by a government commission. An activist group, The Right to Die with Dignity, has been formed to push for this type of legislation. A 2006 poll indicated that Colombians are equally split on the issue.\nIn the meantime, Gustavo Alfonso Quintana, a physician, admitted performing euthanasia on some 15 patients and requested that the practice remain a private matter with a minimum of bureaucratic processes and legal battles. Quintana often refused patients’ requests as in one case where a man requested physician assisted suicide because he was going blind. Before Quintana agreed, he would ask himself, “If I were in his position, would I want to end my life? If I find the answer to be affirmative, then I proceed to induce death. It’s never easy, but I do it out of respect and affection for my patients.”\nOne of Quintana’s patients was a 23-year-old student whose cancer had spread through his testicles, lungs, and brain. A huge lump had developed on his skull and the areas around his eyes were black and swollen. Quintana spent several days in anguished discussions with the student and his family. When the decision had been made, Quintana injected lethal drugs into the man’s arm while his relatives gathered around him, one of them holding his hand. In an interview with the Associated Press, Quintana recalled the student’s plea, “I don’t’ want to wait until I’ve turned into a monster.” On the death certificate, Quintana simply wrote “cardiac arrest” as the cause of death (Associated Press, 2005).\nBelgium\nThe Belgian Parliament legalized euthanasia in 2002, limiting it to competent adults and “emancipated minors.” In 2004, a group of legislators introduced a proposal extending euthanasia to children and adults suffering from dementia and incurable illnesses, insisting that terminally ill children have as much right to choose when they want to die as anyone else. The bill did not pass, but a survey indicated that some physicians are administering lethal drugs to newborns and infants whose chances of survival are considered minimal. In the meantime, about 300 adults who opted for the law’s provisions have died each year since the bill’s passage (Knox, 2006).\nIn 2005, a pharmaceutical company announced that it had developed “home euthanasia kits” that would be available, with a prescription, from pharmacies. These kits include a barbiturate, an anesthetic, a paralyzing agent, and instructions for use; the reasonable cost makes the kits financially viable for the majority of Belgians. These kits are a direct outgrowth of Belgian legislation and the willingness of a sizable number of physicians to accede to the wishes of their terminally ill patients. The Association for the Right to Die with Dignity, located in Brussels, takes the position that people should be masters of their own lives, and polls show that support for this sentiment is growing among the Belgian population (Cowell, 2006).\nSwitzerland\nSwitzerland does not have laws permitting euthanasia or assisted suicide. However, there is a Swiss law that reads, “Whoever from selfish motives induces another to commit suicide or assists him therein shall be punished if the suicide was successful or attempted, by confinement in a penitentiary for not more than five years or by imprisonment.” The key words in this legislation are “from selfish motives.” Hence, in Switzerland, there is no prosecution if the person assisting a suicide successfully claims that he or she had been acting unselfishly, which results in de facto legalization. Rather than being “legal,” assisted suicide is “unpunishable,” unless a “selfish motive” is involved. Finally, there is no assumption that the person assisting the suicide was a physician, thus the enabler need not have medical credentials to escape punishment.\nThe Dignitas Clinic in Zurich has operated openly for years, and received international attention when Annie Turner, aged 66, arrived from England to take a barbiturate potion that ended her life. Turner reported that she was in constant pain due to progressive supranuclear palsy, a degenerative and incurable disorder. Turner successfully took her own life, and the clinic escaped prosecution. The case was controversial because Turner was not bound to a wheelchair and displayed no external symptoms of her illness. However, she told BBC television interviewer, “I may look as though I am all right, but I am not.”\nJohn Close was another British citizen who died at the Dignitas Clinic, after years of suffering from an incurable nervous system disorder. His sister sadly remarked, “He didn’t want to get to the stage where he could do nothing for himself. That was a step beyond a dignified life for him” (Knox, 2005). On the other hand, 70% of people applying to Dignitas, and who have received preliminary approval from a physician, change their minds and do not follow up on this approval.\nGreat   Britain\nThe Dignity in Dying society in Great   Britain has been attempting to get British legislators to debate whether physician assisted suicide should be permitted. This debate would focus on such issues in bioethics as “What is life?” “Who owns it?” “Who decides when to end it?” The issue is clouded by the case of Harold Shipman, a physician who was implicated in the deaths of some 260 of his patients and who hanged himself in his prison cell in 2004. It is also influenced by memories of the Nazi initiative to kill handicapped and disabled infants, children, and adults, as well as members of targeted religious and ethnic groups. However, a poll conducted in the early 21st century indicated that 80% of British adults support implementation of a law permitting assisted suicide (Knox, 2005).\nNonetheless, Michael Irwin, a British physician, lost his medical license in 2005 when he helped a disabled friend plan his own death, and was outspoken in urging other terminally ill patients to consider making the same decision. Diane Pretty died in 2002 after waging a long and public legal battle to permit her husband to administer lethal drugs. Pretty suffered from motor neuron disease, an incurable, progressive affliction of the nervous system known, in some forms, as Lou Gehrig’s Disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Stephen Hawking, the renowned physicist, has the same disease and is an icon for those who oppose the premature ending of life. Lou Gehrig was a famous baseball player from the United   States who died from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and his name is frequently linked with the incurable disease.\nThe Dignity in Dying group points out that outsiders can not really know the anguish of terminal illness. It not only involves discomfort, but the humiliation of depending on others, the awareness of immanent death, and the sense of helplessness in the face of the inevitable outcome. However, Baroness Finlay, a member of the British House of Lords, insists “This is not the time to change the law so that killing people becomes a therapeutic option” (Cowell, 2006).\nThe “ Death in America” Project\nSuicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States and occurs 2,000 times per day throughout the world, even though the topic is rarely mentioned in some societies (Tolaas, 2005). There are multiple reasons for this taboo; in some societies, suicide brings shame upon the family, and in others it is a deeply unsettling event, threatening the social fabric. In our opinion, the overarching reason for silence is that suicide reminds family members, friends, acquaintances, and even strangers of their own immanent demise. Terror Management Theory (Solomon, Greenberg & Pyszczynski, 2003) maintains that “human beings purchase psychological equanimity by collectively deluding themselves about the fragility of existence and the inevitability of its termination” (p. 301). To devote an inordinate amount of time discussing the suicide of an individual or to even discuss the topic in general terms confronts people with the terror of death. This terror can be managed through belief systems that promise a post-mortem existence; but most of these belief systems deal harshly with those who take their own lives. Hence, denial and repression serve as defense mechanisms that promote daily coping and maintain the quest for self-preservation.\nIn an attempt to break through this taboo in the United States, George Soros, in 1994, introduced his Death in America project to the general public. Claiming that death has replaced sex as a taboo topic, Soros provided 15 million dollars (U.S.) to establish a headquarters for his project at Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons. Soros’ project is devoted to “transform the culture of dying” by legalizing euthanasia and physician assisted suicide, and has funded over 40 programs to promulgate his ideas. For example, an Internet site titled “Health Force: Women and Men Against AIDS” helps grieving individuals write “Dear Death” letters as a means of coming to terms with the death of loved ones. Soros gave a grant to the Ellen Stephen Hospice to expand its services to South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Indian reservation to become a national model for Native Americans who are coping with terminally ill members of their families. In 1996, Soros’ project funded the first meeting on care for the terminally ill ever held by the National Institutes of Health (Ehrenfeld, 1997).\nDeath has not been treated nobly in the United   States where there is considerable confusion and controversy regarding “right-to-die” decisions. In 2005, a young girl by the name of Haleigh Young was hospitalized after her stepfather beat her unconscious with a baseball bat, and then burned her body. Haleigh was kept alive by means of a feeding tube and ventilator, even though physicians determined that she was “virtually brain dead” and in a “permanent vegetative state.” A few weeks after her hospitalization, the State of Massachusetts Department of Social Services decided to remove her feeding and breathing tubes, and her biological mother agreed. The only person who objected to the procedure was Haleigh’s stepfather, because he would have been charged with murder if Haleigh died. Eventually, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in favor of removing the tubes, saying it was “unthinkable” for her stepfather to make the decision to keep Haleigh alive. Instead, they gave the power to the Department of Social Services, even though it had failed to act 17 different times when it received reports of Haleigh’s abuse or neglect. While the contention was going on, Haleigh began breathing on her own and the breathing tube was removed. Nevertheless, the medical records were sealed by the physicians as were Haleigh’s social service records. Politicians in Massachusetts vowed to make a full-scale investigation of the incompetence involved, but it is questionable whether their interest in the case focuses on Haleigh or on winning votes in forthcoming elections (Malkin, 2006).\nEven more highly publicized was the case of Terri Schiavo, whose long illness divided her family, brought about protests and attempted interventions from the Pope, the United States President, the governor of Florida, and the United States Congress before a court decision allowed physicians to remove her feeding tubes in March, 2005 (Schiavo, 2006; Schneider & Schneider, 2006). A prominent U.S. Senator, Bill Frist, who was a surgeon before he entered politics, made a statement about Schiavo that, according to TIME magazine, “destroyed his reputation.” Frist stated that, based on the television footage he had seen, “she does respond” to external stimuli. TIME magazine called this statement “utter nonsense,” but it won political support for Senator Frist among religious conservatives. Even so, he decided not to run for re-election.\nWhile the Schiavo controversy raged, Jack Kevorkian, an American physician who championed terminal patients' “right to die,” languished in jail because of his role in helping over one hundred men and women die. Kevorkian called for the establishment of “suicide clinics,” and the U.S. media referred to him as “Doctor Death” (Kevorkian, 1991). He invented a device, the “Thanaton,” that could be attached to a patient’s body; when these patients were ready to die, they pressed a button that released chemicals into their body. He also invented a device, the “Mercitron,” that employed a gas mask that was fed by a canister of carbon monoxide. The Mercitron was necessary because Kevorkian’s medical license was revoked following publicity resulting from his initial instances of physician assisted suicide, and he could not longer obtain the drugs and chemicals needed for the Thanaton. Many of the people who appealed to Kevorkian for assistance were members of the Unitarian Universalist Church, which has never issued a blanket condemnation of physician assisted suicide. In 1999, Kevorkian was found guilty of second-degree homicide by a jury in the state of Michigan and was given a 10-to-15 year sentence. He was released on probation in 2007.\n“Compassion and Choices” in the United States\n“Compassion and Choices” was formerly named the Hemlock Society, because of Socrates’ decision to drink a poisonous hemlock brew (instead of escaping) when he was sentenced to death by the Greek Senate. This organization purports to be dedicated to bringing “dignity, choice, and compassion” into the lives of terminally ill people. They have prepared a document for its members to sign, which states, “If a time comes when I am suffering from an incurable and terminal illness, and choose to end my suffering, I wish to have physician aid-in-dying.” Compassion and Choices urges its members to complete a “living will” and “power of attorney” for health care, both of which give its members, or those who they designate, control over the time and manner of their death. The organization makes several books available to its members including one by Barbara Roberts (2002), former governor of Oregon, who chronicled her husband’s torturous death from lung cancer.\nCompassion and Choices supports the State of Oregon’s 1997 law that allowed physicians to prescribe lethal drugs to terminally ill patients who want to end their lives. This law was challenged by the Bush administration but was upheld in a 2006 decision of the United States Supreme Court. The federal objection to the law was that it violated laws concerning dangerous drugs. However, a national Harris poll conducted in 2005 found that 70% of Americans believe that “the law should allow doctors to comply with the wishes of a dying patient in severe distress who asks to have his or her life ended.” In 1982, 53% of Americans agreed with that statement. In the decade since the Oregon law was passed and the Oregon Health Division was organized to implement it, over 200 patients decided to end their lives under its provisions (Jacoby, 2005).\nThe Harris poll indicated that 67% of the American public would favor a similar law in their state. The Oregon law has strict conditions, requiring that:\n1. Two physicians certify that the patient is 18 or older and has no more than six months to live;\n2. The patient has made three requests to the physician for a lethal dose of medication, twice orally and once in writing;\n3. The prescription will be filled only after a 15-day waiting period;\n4. Patients will take the drug themselves.\nMost of the deaths take place at home, usually with family members and a health care worker present. One of us (Krippner) had a friend who had a debilitating disease and was a member of Compassion and Choices. She lived in Oregon and followed each provision of the law whiles her family members and a health care worker sat by her side, and while a recording of her favorite music was playing.\nHistorical and Contrasting Values\nIn 2001, President Bush’s attorney general threatened to prosecute any Oregon physician who prescribed drugs to cause death, but the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit overruled him. Supporters of the Oregon law have noted that it does not use the term “physician assisted suicide,” because it does not conform to the usual definition of “suicide.” One Oregon patient remarked, “The only question I have is whether I will be able to say goodbye to my family while I’m still myself” (Jacoby, 2005).\nGilbert Meilaender, a member of President George W. Bush’s Council on Bioethics, has stated that “assisted suicide is the opening wedge in the more general argument for our culture to move on to the euthanasia of people whose lives are regarded as being of minimal value.”Although many supporters of physician assisted suicide would accuse Meilaender of making an extremist statement, Meilaender’s backers could remind them that the Nazi Holocaust provides (e.g., Wood, 2007).\nIn October 1939, Hitler authorized the “Aktion T 4” Nazi euthanasia program, first targeting the “mercy killing” of sick and disabled persons. This program was soon expanded to Hitler's decree of October, 1939, typed on his personal stationary, enlarging \"the authority of certain physicians to be designated by name in such manner that persons who, according to human judgment, are incurable can, upon a most careful diagnosis of their condition of sickness, be accorded a mercy death\" (History of Euthanasia, 2007). Within a few years, this agenda encompassed “inferior” ethnic groups (Jews, Slavs, gypsies, etc.) as well as Germans whose behavior demonstrated their “inferiority” (homosexuals, political activists, etc.). Years later, the diplomat Dennis Ross (2005) was to characterize the Holocaust as “an unimaginable evil” (p. 18).\nThis view of euthanasia stemming from the notion of life having minimal value stands in sharp contrast with the Australian Aboriginal motives for euthanasia. Eoral/Dharawal Aborigines’ beliefs in reincarnation, transmigration, the sacredness of life, and their fearless perception of death as a rite of passage present a paradigm in which life has so much value that its cessation on the earthly plane does not terminate it.\nThe motives behind the Nazi’s forced euthanasia program and the Aborigines’ indigenous euthanasia program could not be more at odds. Meilander’s “slippery slope” rationale is superficial in nature and needs to be spelled out to be convincing. Meilander and his supporters would do their cause a service if they would cite specific steps that would follow from the regulation of physician assisted suicide to the extermination of “minimal value” persons. Instead, a logical leap is made that, even if it were plausible, does not hold up under scrutiny. The Aborigines’ program is carefully thought through and regulated, reflecting a centuries-old tradition. The Nazi program was a “top-down” ordinance, not a “bottom-up” custom based on long-standing values.\nWe are not assuming that all similar indigenous customs are permeated with the same values even when they are intended to ease suffering. Sati (or Suttee) was a Hindu funeral practice dating back to about 400 C. E., in which a widow would throw herself in her husband’s funeral pyre in recapitulating the myth in which the goddess Dakshayani immolated herself because she was unable to bear the humiliation of her husband Shiva by her father. Reunion in the afterlife and a demonstration of devotion were seen as admirable motives. As the centuries went by, the practice varied from one area to another. In some, Sati was used for political purposes or status; in an 1806 case in Nepal the Marahai Raj Rajeshwari Devi was forced to commit Sati following her husband’s assasination; in others, the widow, especially if childless, knew she could expect little from life once her husband had died. In other parts of India Sati was forced on the widow via social pressures; as recently as the 19th century the British East India company recorded over 4,000 incidents of suttee in Bengal (Thompson, 2007). Although sati has been illegal in India since 1829, occasional reports of its practice still surface.\nVoluntary Sati was not committed by the inform or the terminally ill. However, there were cases in which it was motivated by extreme depression, by the hopeless existence that was thought to follow a husband’s demise, by the absence of viable alternatives, or even by religious devotion.\nThe anthropology of consciousness contributes to an understanding of suicide when different cultures are compared and contrasted. A Dutch patient whose every waking moment is filled with pain, a terminally ill Australian aborigine who yearns for rebirth, and a Hindu widow whose uncontrolled depression leads her to her deceased mate’s funeral pyre have more in common than one might initially surmise. At the same time, the Nazi guard who tosses a baby in an oven and a fanatical group of religious devotees in India who immolate a young widow are acting from mythological premises that justify murder. It is not that the lives they destroy are of minimal value, it is that the dogma they espouse takes precedence over human life, individually or collectively.\nThe Public Debate\nBy 2040, one in four people in Europe will be 64 or older. In the United States, the ratio will be one in five. As members of the post-World War II generation grow older, their increasing frailty will strain health care and welfare systems, not to mention their families. As a result, governments will be under pressure to bow to demands to legalize euthanasia, according to supporters of these options. The same groups also claim that assisted suicide and euthanasia take place everywhere in the world, but usually illegally. Boris Dittrich, the Dutch legislator who was the major author of the Dutch euthanasia law, has stated, “We want to write it down and get it out in the open so that we know what is going on. We don’t want any misuse or abuse. If you don’t do it in a transparent way, the chances for abuse or misuse are larger.” In fact, in countries where euthanasia is legal, there has not been a dramatic increase in the number of reported cases (Knox, 2005). But opponents of the practices worry that euthanasia and assisted suicide will become too acceptable and will be sought by people who are not suffering from terminal illnesses or who are unable to make rational decisions (Singer, 2006).\nIn the meantime, the Swiss Dignitas Clinic has opened an office in Germany; its goal is to attempt to change German laws because one poll showed that 74% of the German public supported the option of euthanasia for seriously ill patients. Only 20% of Germans opposed legalizing the practice, and the rest were undecided. The debate is muted in countries with a strong Roman Catholic tradition, except for Spain where 75% of adults support the practice, and where 21% of physicians claim to know of cases of assisted suicide. Indeed, 15% of Spanish physicians admitted that they had participated in assisted suicide themselves. The Council of Europe (2003-2004) published two volumes on the topic of euthanasia, defining it as “an action or omission with the primary intent of bringing about a patient’s death in order to end his or her suffering” (van der Lugt, 2004). One volume was devoted entirely to ethical issues, dating the debate back to the Hippocratic Oath, which specifically forbids the practice (Council of Europe, 2003-2004). It can be seen that this topic has become a player as well as a pawn in the so-called “culture wars” that characterize diversity in the 21st century. As cultures come into closer contact with each other, there are opportunities for cooperation as well as for conflict.\nThe 2004 United Nations Human Development Report ranked 177 countries on a “Human Development Index” that measured such indicators of societal health as life expectancy, adult literacy, per-capita income, low rates of HIV infection, gender equality, and educational attainment. The leading countries on this index were Norway, Sweden, Australian, Canada, and the Netherlands – all countries whose citizens classified themselves as “atheists” more often than those countries at the bottom of the index (Zuckerman, 2006). The sole indicator of societal health in which religious countries scored higher than non-religious countries was the absence of suicide, but some would argue that the right to end one’s own life can be seen as a positive sign of a mature society. The world’s most powerful religious institutions are opposed to anything resembling euthanasia, but secular humanists, members of less powerful religious groups, and independent thinkers—including some of those who are strategically placed in the media—are calling blanket opposition to assisted suicide into question.\nIn the film, “The Sea Inside,” Spanish actor Javier Bardim won plaudits for his portrayal of a terminally ill author who finally persuaded someone to help him die. In the Academy Award-winning film, “Million Dollar Baby,” Clint Eastwood played a boxing trainer who facilitated the death of his protégée, played by Hilary Swank, following a debilitating boxing injury. In a journal published by the American Society of Law, Medicine, and Ethics, Coleman and Fleischman (1996) refer to the “serious public debate” raging in the United States regarding assisted suicide and euthanasia. More and more people around the world are becoming aware of the ceaseless suffering involved in Alzheimer’s and AIDS-related diseases and other terminal illnesses. This has led not only to increased interest in assisted suicide and euthanasia, but to a search for alternatives. More powerful painkilling drugs are being developed, sympathetic hospice workers are insuring “good deaths,” and training in “mindful dying” is offered by many Unitarian-Universalist churches and several Buddhist centers.\nSpiritual Approaches to a “Good Death”\nPallative care for the dying in hospices and other institutions appears to be one arena where advocates and opponents of euthanasia can find a common ground (van der Lugt, 2004). If the United States can be described as a “death denying” society, most indigenous groups stand in marked contrast, conceptualizing death as part of the life cycle and providing meaningful rituals and pallative care for the terminally ill. One of us (Krippner) has visited The Sisterhood of the Good Death, a group of women in Salvador, Brazil, who are associated with both the Roman Catholic Church and Candomble’, an African-Brazilian religion. These women devote themselves to the dying, engaging in a never-ending cycle of cooking, singing, massage, and counseling to provide a “good death” for those men and women in their care.\nIn the Hindu tradition, to die with Gods name on one’s lips is a conscious way of returning to the “Source of Being,” in preparation for one’s next incarnation. When Mahatma Gandhi was struck by an assassin’s bullet, he uttered the name “Ram,” one of the appellations for God, as he fell, mortally wounded (Levine, 1982, p. 27). A traditional parting proclamation for Jewish people has been, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One.” The last words of St. Francis of Assisi were, “Welcome, Sister Death.” St. Teresa of Avila proclaimed, “Lord, now is the time to arise and go….My soul shall enjoy the fulfillment of all her desire.” Such reverence has marked the deaths of countless Roman Catholics whose final moments found them repeating the phrase, “Sweet Mother of Heaven.” The Blackfoot Indian Chief Crowfoot stated,\nA little while and I will be gone from among you, whither I cannot tell. From nowhere we came, into nowhere we go. What is life? It is a flash, a firefly in the night. It is a breath of a buffalo in the winter time. It is the little shadow that runs across the grass and loses itself in the sunset. (Schneidman, 1980)\nOne of the classical philosophical discussions between the human species and all other forms of life is humanity’s awareness of its own mortality, but numerous spiritual traditions and practices have emerged from that awareness. In death-denying societies, people often refuse to reveal their true age, spend large sums of money to erase their wrinkles and transplant their hair, and tell their dying relatives that they will recover soon. Ernest Becker (1973) observed that the denial of death starts in childhood and shows up in recurrent nightmares.\nIn their tortured interiors radiate complex symbols of many inadmissible realities – terror of the world, the horror of one’s own wishes, the feat of vengeance by parents, the disappearance of things, one’s lack of control over anything….But the child has to take it, and so he [or she] wakes up screaming. (pp. 19-20)\nRather than denying death and refusing to discuss it, most indigenous societies have conceptualized it as a part of life. The Egyptian Chapters of Coming Forth by Day is a “book of the dead” that dates back to about 1600 B.C.E. It casts no doubt regarding the reality of this world or the next, in contrast to the Tibetan “book of the dead,” Liberation by Hearing on the After-Death Plane, whichviews the entire human experience, including the after-life, as being fraught with illusion. This Tibetan tome teaches the dying to face death calmly and with a clear mind so that one will be able to transcend bodily suffering with a trained intellect that focuses on transcendence. It also teaches that denying death produces unfavorable results and that prolonging life with medicines dulls the mind and one’s ability to attain liberation. When the Tibetan yogi Milarepa was preparing to die, he welcomed death with a song about the naturalness of his passing (Krippner, 1989).\nMythological Themes\nThe anthropology of consciousness can provide examples of indigenous people and traditional cultures that can provide useful antidotes to the denial of death so prevalent in many Western cultures. These traditions can inspire people to imbue their time on earth with a richness of meaning that cannot be overshadowed by the certainty of their death. They can remind people that they can survive genetically, by their good works, and in the memories of those whose lives they have touched. Some people can be content to survive as part of the cosmic process, happy to have carried their banners in the universal parade of existence (Krippner, 1989). As Robert J. Lifton (1968) noted, following his study of Japanese citizens who had survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the basic spiritual principle, with or without a concept of afterlife or immortal soul, is the ancient mythological theme of death and rebirth. Whatever the imagery, at the heart of religious mythology is a sense of spiritual power. This power may be understood in a number of ways including dedication, capacity love, and moral determination. But underlying all of them is the power one has over death. Some of the survivors he interviewed, cited an ancient proverb, “The state may collapse, but the mountains and rivers remain” (p. 22).\nCarl Jung (1961) examined beliefs about life and death of various cultural mythologies and admitted that embracing a personal myth about survival of death was, for him, psychologically hopeful and enriching. The lives of Christ, Mohammed, Moses, the Buddha, and other spiritual leaders encompassed various combinations of revelation and ultimate ethical principles that could divest death of its “sting” of annihilation. Mythology (those narratives that address existential human issues, often in metaphorical ways) is still important in the contemporary world, especially in regard to the end of life. The anthropology of consciousness can examine the ways that indigenous people and traditional cultures often exemplify ways of caring for the dying that are more sophisticated and compassionate than what can be found in Western hospitals and nursing homes. The stories that they tell about the dying process and what lies beyond bring comfort and hope to the terminally ill as well as their loved ones. The debate about physician assisted suicide will not go away, especially as aging populations increase more rapidly than the funds to assist them when they become seriously ill.\nThe next step that anthropologists could make is to catalogue the ways that traditional cultures have dealt with (and are dealing with) elderly people as well as younger men and women who develop terminal illness. Anthropologist could ask such questions as at what point do practical and/or humanitarian considerations outweigh the “heroic interventions” needed to keep an individual alive? What role does the terminally ill person play in hard decisions that must be made and ethical concerns that need to be faced? What type of legal framework would allow for the greatest freedom of choice, and prevent religious and political pressure groups from interfering with decisions made by family members and by ill people themselves? These are life-and-death concerns that will become more salient as the 21st century progresses; anthropologists have the opportunity to play a vital role in this discourse. For example, indigenous worldviews are more likely to allow Nature to play a role make its voice heard in this discourse. Collective societies are more likely than individualistic societies to have a repository of rituals to ease transitions, such as those from life to death, for its members (Braun, Pietsch, & Blanchette, 2000; Parkes, 1997).\nIn Greek mythology, Aurora, goddess of the dawn, gave her human husband Tithonus eternal life, but forgot to give him perpetual youth. Tithonus grew older and weaker, until he shriveled down into a cricket. If humans learn to cure all diseases and heal any wound, but not prevent their cells from aging, they might face a similar unsatisfactory end (Jennings, 2005). Traditional cultures pay more attention to the role of ritual and ceremony during one’s final days than do modern societies (Holden, 2002), whether or not they practice euthanasia. Most indigenous spiritual traditions stress the concept that what matters is not how long a person lives but how well a person lives. Whether or not there is an afterlife, the quality of one’s existence on planet Earth deserves to be contemplated and examined, as well as the final days of that existence.\nReferences\nAdvocates for Better Care.\n1993 A Religious Response to Euthanasia.

It is argued that the norms of medicine prohibit a physician from ever acting with the intent to kill a patient or to aid him in killing himself. For this reason it is essential, they believe, to maintain a sharp distinction between allowing patients to die [passive euthanasia], say by the refusal to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and acts of assisted suicide.”\n1998 - Gerald Dworkin, PhD\nPRO (yes)\nPro\nYale Kamisar, JD, Professor Emeritus of Law at the University of Michigan Law School, in his chapter “The Rise and Fall of the ‘Right’ to Assisted Suicide” published in the 2002 book The Case Against Assisted Suicide: For the Right to End-of-Life Care, wrote:\n“Although the right to terminate artificial life-support systems [passive euthanasia] and the right to enlist the assistance of another in committing suicide can be, and have been, lumped together under the rubric of ‘right to die,’ the two ‘rights’ are different in important respects. As the New York State Task Force on Life and Law noted, the so-called right to die should mean only, and until recently meant only, ‘a right against intrusion,’ a right to resist ‘a direct invasion of bodily integrity, and in some cases, the use of physical restraints, both of which are flatly inconsistent with society’s basic conception of personal dignity.’ To be sure, a total prohibition against assisted suicide does close an ‘avenue of escape,’ but, unlike a refusal to honor a competent patient’s request to terminate life-sustaining treatment, it does not force one into ‘a particular, all-consuming, totally dependent and indeed rigidly standardized life: the life of one confined to a hospital bed, attached to medical machinery, and tended to by medical professionals.'”\n2002 - Yale Kamisar, JD\nPro\nFrances M.

Does this mean that one will have killed whenever one stops a machine belonging to someone else (which one is not running)? No, for if one has the permission either of the machine’s owner or the person receiving aid to stop it, and one is then seen as their agent carrying out their will, one will be letting die…\nOnly a killing introduces an original cause> which induces death, rather than merely removing the barrier to a cause of death that is or will be present…\nIf a doctor actively assists an active sucide (either by, for example, giving lethal drugs or giving drugs to facilitate a patient’s suicidal act), he assists in killing…\nThe fact that the doctor must terminate treatment and we must allow termination of treatment, even when the patient and his doctor intend his death, does not show that it is permissible to… assist [the patient] in killing himself, or required of us to allow these acts, when the patient and doctor intend his death.”\n1998 - Frances M.

Emanuel, MD, PhD, Chair of the Department of Clinical Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health, in his 2000 article “A Time to Die: The Place for Physician Assistance,” that appeared in the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law argued:\n“Frequently, people indicate that their support for… PAS [physician-assisted suicide] is based on the fact that they would not want to live ‘hooked up to machine’ or ‘when it’s hopeless:’ Advocates of euthanasia and PAS encourage such thinking when they elide the moral and legal distinctions between intentionally ending a life through an intervention, such as an injection of muscle relaxants, and stopping medical treatments [passive euthanasia]…\nIn June 1997 the U.S. Supreme Court made quite clear that these actions are legally distinct. There is a constitutional right to refuse medical treatments and even have a proxy exercise that refusal, while, by a vote of 9 to 0, the Court clearly stated that there is no constitutional right for either euthanasia or PAS. There is also a moral distinction. The safeguards we think appropriate and necessary for permitting euthanasia or PAS are not necessary for terminating medical care… Such differences in safeguards bespeak different moral evaluations about stopping medical interventions and actively injecting a patient with a life-ending drug.”\n2000 - Ezekiel Emanuel, MD, PhD\nCON (no)\nCon\nR.G. Frey, PhD, Professor of Philosophy at Bowling Green State University, in his chapter “Distinctions in Death” that appears in the 1998 book Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide: For and Against, argued:\n“It has been widely remarked that passive euthanasia is relatively common in our hospitals (or in the homes of patients), and doctors do not all that reluctantly shy away from conceding that they take part in withdrawing treatment at the request of terminally ill patients. Yet…few doctors indeed concede that they supply, at the request of their terminally ill patients, pills that produce death. In the former case, the patient is on a life-support system, which the doctor may permissibly, at the request of the patient, withdraw; in the latter case, the patient is not on a life-support system, and the doctor may not permissibly, at the request of the patient, supply pills that produce death. It seems little short of incredible that the fact that a terminally ill patient is or is not on a life-support system could so transform cases, morally, when both cases show quite clearly that patient and doctor are acting together to bring about the patient’s death at the instigation of the patient…\nWithdrawing feeding tubes and starving the patient to death is permissible, supplying the patient with a pill that produces death is not. Yet both sorts of assistance assuredly produce death, and both sorts involve the patient and doctor acting together to produce that death. Notice, too, that both sorts of assistance are compatible with being rendered with the intention of relieving the patient’s suffering. How can there be a moral difference between them, with these things the case?”\n1998 - R.G. Frey, DPhil\nCon\nLance K. Stell, PhD, Charles A. Dana Professor of Philosophy at Davidson College, in his chapter “Physician-Assisted Suicide: To Decriminalize or to Legalize, That is the Question,” published in the 1998 book, Physician Assisted Suicide: Expanding the Debate, claimed:\n“The ideas that ‘letting nature take its course’ is inherently different from causing death and that a physician’s abating life-sustaining treatment [passive euthanasia] at patient request is inherently different from physician-assisted suicide are philosophically untenable. One way to cause death is to ‘let’ nature take its course. One way for physicians to assist suicide, while remaining within their professional capacities, is for them to write orders that withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment at patient request. The latter claim implies only that it is possible for physicians to assist suicide by acting within their well-recognized authority to abate life-sustaining treatment at patient request. It does not imply that their abating life-sustaining treatment at patient request amounts to, constitutes, is equivalent to assisted suicide. To refute my modest claim, one would have to prove that it is not possible for physicians to assist suicide in this way. Further, I will argue that physician-assisted suicide (already effectively decriminalized) should be fully and formally decriminalized. It should not be ‘legalized-but-strictly-regulated’ unless such a regime would extend to medically managed, physician-facilitated deaths generally.”\n1998 - Lance K. Stell, PhD\nCon\nThe U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in the majority opinion from Compassion in Dying v. Washington (1996), wrote:\n“We see no ethical or constitutionally cognizable difference between a doctor’s pulling the plug on a respirator> [passive euthanasia] and his prescribing drugs which will permit a terminally ill patient to end his own life [physician-assisted suicide]. In fact, some might argue that pulling the plug is a more culpable and aggressive act on the doctor’s part and provides more reason for criminal prosecution. To us, what matters most is that the death of the patient is the intended result as surely in one case as in the other. In sum, we find the state’s interests in preventing suicide do not make its interests substantially stronger here than in cases involving other forms of death-hastening medical intervention. To the extent that a difference exists, we conclude that it is one of degree and not of kind.”\n1996 - Compassion in Dying v.

Assuming this bit of common sense is correct, there is reason to suppose that people, on average, are less susceptible to being pressured into killing themselves than they are into letting someone kill them…\nA second consequence of the common sense point concerns the acts of suicide and submission to euthanasia that would in fact occur as a result of legalization. One natural way to understand the thought that killing yourself is harder than having someone do it for you is that killing yourself requires firmer resolve. The element of passivity involved in your letting another perform the unpleasant task of putting you out of your misery means that your will is not as active as it would be if you performed the task yourself, and thus weakness or irresolution in the will is less likely to cause failure, less likely to cause an interruption in the lethal action. Conversely, then, a completed act of suicide warrants more confidence in its having issued from a will that was strong or resolute than does a completed act of submission to euthanasia. Accordingly, though any act by which a person deliberately hastens his or her death raises concerns about its voluntariness, there is less reason to worry, other things being equal, about the voluntariness of suicide than about the voluntariness of submitting to euthanasia…\nOne can, to be sure, imagine physician-assisted suicides that are not significantly different from submitting to euthanasia. Assisted suicides in which the amount of assistance is so great as to reduce the patient’s role to that of merely taking the very last steps, nothing more than opening a mouth, say, and intentionally swallowing a capsule placed therein by the physician are, practically speaking, equivalent to submitting voluntarily to active euthanasia. And if such suicides were typical of the suicides that resulted from legalizing the practice, then one could not seriously object to conflating it with voluntary active euthanasia when making utilitarian arguments against their legalization… But neither [Yale] Kamisar nor, as far as one can tell, any of the prominent opponents of legalization he cites offers reasons to think that such suicides would be typical. “\n2002 - John Deigh, PhD\nPro\nThe New York State Task Force on Life and the Law’s 1994 report entitled When Death Is Sought: Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the Medical Context explained in Chapter 4, “Decisions at Life’s End: Existing Law”:\n“Although it is frequently argued that suicide assistance and active euthanasia are morally equivalent, the law in all states draws a clear distinction between these two types of acts. In New York, assisting a suicide, except in certain limited circumstances, is a form of second-degree manslaughter. Euthanasia, however, falls under the definition of second-degree murder, as the defendant intentionally causes the death of the victim through his or her direct acts. Because the consent of the victim is not a defense to murder, euthanasia is therefore prosecutable as murder in the second degree. “\n1994 - New York State Task Force on Life and the Law\nPro\nFrances Kamm, PhD, Lucius Littauer Professor of Philosophy and Public Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, in her essay “Physician-Assisted Suicide, Euthanasia, and Intending Death” published in the 1998 book Physician-Assisted Suicide: Expanding the Debate, explained:\n“Euthanasia involves a death that is intended (not merely foreseen) in order to benefit the person who dies. It differs from physician-assisted suicide undertaken in the interest of the person who dies partly in that it involves a final act or omission by someone other than the patient (e.g., the doctor) in order to end the patient’s life…. In active euthanasia, the doctor introduces the cause of the patient’s death, e.g., a lethal injection…. Active physician-assisted suicide can involve, for example, the provision of means of death, like pills, that a patient may use. However, it might also involve giving the patient a stimulant to keep him awake so that he can shoot himself. That is, the active assistance need not involve giving a lethal substance.”\n1998 - Frances M. Kamm, PhD\nCON (no)\nCon\nR.G.

What seems common to them all is that patient and doctor act together to bring about the death of the patient; in this light, they simply represent different ways patient and doctor may interact to produce this death. What turns, then, upon calling one PAS and calling another AVE?\nSuppose a doctor rigs up a machine that enables his patient to breathe carbon monoxide but leaves it to the patient to press the button that turns on the machine: what is the difference between this case and one in which everything is the same except that the doctor pushes the button to start the machine? To say that the latter is a case of AVE while the former is a case of PAS simply becasue of who acts last is not yet to point to a moral difference between them. In both cases… what happens is that the patient and doctor act together to bring about the death of the patient. “\n1998 - R.G.

First, they argue that the supposed greater degree of patient control in cases of PAS is overstated…\nSecondly, if one of the main moral arguments advanced by campaigners for PAS is respect for the autonomous request of a suffering patient, why should the patient’s autonomous request for VAE not carry equal weight? Why should a patient who wants the doctor to administer a lethal injection (and a doctor who wants to comply) not have their autonomy respected?…\nThirdly, the physical difference between intentionally ending the patient’s life, and intentionally helping the patient to end his or her own life, can be negligible. What, for example, is the supposed difference between a doctor handing a lethal pill to a patient; placing the pill on the patient’s tongue; and dropping it down the patient’s throat? Where does PAS end and VAE begin? It is easy to see why many conclude that the supposed distinction between PAS and VAE, even when it can be drawn in the physical world, has little significance (if any) in the moral world. “\n2002 - John Keown, DPhil, PhD\nCon\nDan Brock, PhD, Professor of Medical Ethics at Harvard Medical School, in his 1992 article “Voluntary Active Euthanasia” published in The Hastings Center Report argued:\n“In the recent bioethics literature some have endorsed physician-assisted suicide but not euthanasia. Are they sufficiently different that the moral arguments for one often do not apply to the other? A paradigm case of physician-assisted suicide is a patient’s ending his or her life with a lethal dose of a medication requested of and provided by a physician for that purpose. A paradigm case of voluntary active euthanasia is a physician’s administering the lethal dose, often because the patient is unable to do so. The only difference that need exist between the two is the person who actually administers the lethal dose – the physician or the patient. In each, the physician plays an active and necessary causal role.\nIn physician-assisted suicide the patient acts last (for example, Janet Adkins herself pushed the button after Dr. Kevorkian hooked her up to his suicide machine), whereas in euthanasia the physician acts last by performing the physical equivalent of pushing the button. In both cases, however, the choice rests fully with the patient. In both the patient acts last in the sense of retaining the right to change his or her mind until the point at which the lethal process becomes irreversible. How could there be a substantial moral difference between the two based only on this small difference in the part played by the physician in the causal process resulting in death?”\n1992 - Dan Brock, PhD", "Euthanasia Western Argument - 603 Words | Internet Public Library\nUS STATES\nStates Ranked by Size & Population\nStates Ranked by Date\nIPL\nEuthanasia Western Argument\nEuthanasia Western Argument\n603 Words 3 Pages\nThe fourth common Western argument in favor of euthanasia is the argument of self-determination.

As decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, education, etc. The decision on how and when to die is one of the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime. Therefore we have the right to die; some even claim that it is a human right, a negative right (the corresponding obligation is non-intervention in suicide attempts) and a positive law (which is suicide correlative duty of care).

However, the Confucian echo argument for euthanasia is the weakest here. The Western argument has to do with the permissibility of suicide and euthanasia, while Confucian ethics deals with the inadmissibility of not committing suicide. In other words, the Western argument concerns the admissibility of any suicide, regardless of value. Confucian ethics, however, deals only with the legality of a suicide, which is considered morally worthy.

Who would qualify for physician assisted suicide/euthanasia? Only people with certain diseases or prognoses? Should the physician decide when to allow PAS/ euthanasia, or should the patient be in full control of the decision? If legalized, would euthanasia be legalized murder? Is it the role of our law to enforce conformity on the country’s moral status? And when is it acceptable to give up on palliative care and allow this separation from life? In a Dutch survey of 1456 physicians, 1121 stated that they had received requests for physician assisted suicide/euthanasia (Emanuel). Although discussing suicide options for terminally ill patients is an extremely sensitive and complex issue, it becomes pertinent that their requests should be fully considered when so many patients in this position are begging for assistance in passing peacefully. Since 1947, Gallup has released surveys to the United States population asking, “When a person has a disease that cannot be cured, do you think doctors should be allowed to end the patient’s life by some painless means if the patient and his family request it?” (Emanuel). In 2005, 75% of the surveyed population agreed with this statement. Although there has been a consistent majority in public support to this issue as reported by Gallup, euthanasia still remains illegal in the United States. One of the main reasons why many people are against the legalization of euthanasia is that many view human life as sacred and the intentional termination of life is murder. It is important to clarify that the difference between murder and euthanasia lies in the motive. While both are technically forms of deprivation from life, euthanasia is altruistic, because “its goal is mitigating the pain and suffering of the patient,” whereas murder is hateful and unwanted by the victim (Turanjanin, pg. 1318). Providing a suffering, terminally ill patient that will inevitably perish a more peaceful and controlled way to depart from this life (when it is requested) is a form of mercy.

Currently, there is a compelling case for human euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.\nAs a result, patients have a right to make their own decisions to preserve free choice and human dignity: this right includes the right to choose assisted suicide should be acknowledged. Having access to physician-assisted suicide also helps the patient to keep control over his or her circumstances and to terminate life in an ethical and merciful manner.\nWhile the medical community has a responsibility to aid patients as much as possible, if there is no hope or recovery, it is their job to alleviate pain and suffering by providing the terminally sick (if they have requested it, of course) with an end to their suffering. If a person is in this circumstance, they should have the choice to choose when and in what palliative care setting their life ends. It seems terrible and horrible to be maintained alive against one's will by technology, especially if pain is a continual aspect.\nThe patient should have the freedom to choose when he dies, as well as the right to die without undue pain or suffering. While a patient may opt to end their life through other methods (such as unplugging tubes or artificial life support networks), this can be extremely painful and time-consuming. Instead, doctors should readily provide the option of a simpler remedy.\nStep-by-step explanation\nReferences\nQuill, T. E., Cassel, C. K., & Meier, D. E. (1994).

Proponents argue that euthanasia/assisted suicide is \"the ultimate civil right,\" and that to deprive mentally competent, terminally ill people who want to end their suffering of a peaceful \"aid in dying\" is to fundamentally disrespect their right to personal autonomy. Proponents also argue that legalizing euthanasia/assisted suicide is a necessary \"insurance policy\" that will ensure that no one dies in painful agony or unremitting suffering. Advocates contend that euthanasia/assisted suicide is little different from pain control since both use strong drugs and patients' deaths are occasionally unintentionally hastened as a side effect of the narcotics used in palliation. They also claim that doctors commonly engage in euthanasia/assisted suicide surreptitiously and promote legalization as a way to protect vulnerable patients from abuses inherent in the current \"unregulated\" practice. Acknowledging worries about potential abuses, advocates assure that \"protective guidelines\" would protect the vulnerable from wrongful death while still permitting suffering patients who are eligible for euthanasia/assisted suicide to obtain a desired, peaceful \"death with dignity.\" Proponents also claim that opposition to euthanasia/assisted suicide is based primarily in religion and that laws prohibiting the practice are thus unconstitutional because they violate the division between church and state.\nOpponents counter that legalizing euthanasia/assisted suicide would lead society down a dangerous \"slippery slope\" with legalized killing eventually being permitted for disabled, elderly, and depressed people, as well as for those who are not mentally competent to request to die. Protective guidelines \"do not protect,\" opponents declare, pointing to the Dutch experience with euthanasia as \"proof\" of both the reality of the slippery slope and the relative meaninglessness of guidelines. Opponents also argue that the economics of modern medicine would promote euthanasia/assisted suicide as a form of health care cost containment, noting that the drugs in an assisted suicide cost only about forty dollars, while proper care for a dying patient can cost tens of thousands of dollars. They also note that forty-four million Americans do not have health insurance, and that medicine is sometimes practiced in a discriminatory manner against racial and other minorities. Thus, they argue that \"the last people to receive medical treatment will be the first to receive assisted suicide.\" Opponents also deny that there is widespread surreptitious euthanasia practiced in clinical medicine, citing several published studies as proof, and urge that hospice care and proper medical treatment provide the morally acceptable answers to the difficulties that are sometimes associated with the process of dying.\nEuthanasia and physicican assisted suicide: Ethics 111 Class debate\nAdditional topics\nEuthanasia and Assisted Suicide - The People Vote\nEuthanasia and Assisted Suicide - The Modern Euthanasia Movement\nOther Free Encyclopedias\nLaw Library - American Law and Legal Information Crime and Criminal Law Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide - The Modern Euthanasia Movement, Pros And Cons, The People Vote, Jack Kevorkian, Legal Challenges", "EUTHANASIA AND ETHICAL ARGUMENTS: HUMAN DIGNITY AT STAKE IN RESPECTABLE AND LEGAL WAY\nprevention of diseases preventive medicine\nEUTHANASIA AND ETHICAL ARGUMENTS: HUMAN DIGNITY AT STAKE IN RESPECTABLE AND LEGAL WAY\nDr Adil Ramzan\nMuhammad Waseem Khan\nMs Bioethics Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi Pakistan\nLecturer Baluchistan University of Information Technology Engineering & Management Sciences Quetta Pakistan\nEmail: mwaseem.tareen@yahoo.com\nKeywords: Autonomy, Euthanasia, Ethical, Proponents, Withhold.\nABSTRACT\nEuthanasia and physician assisted suicide is considered to be in conflict with basic ethical principles of autonomy, justice, beneficence, non-maleficence and dignity in medical practice. Euthanasia being allowed in few states has raised certain ethical questions which are due to be given importance and need to be answered. Proponents of euthanasia argue in favor of passive euthanasia to be allowed and they consider it to be legal and permissible and need of the day. They tend to forget the importance of advancement being made\nin the field of medical sciences and medical technology. Theses advancements are deemed to be used for the benefit of human beings rather than using for taking human beings most precious property.\nEUTHANASIA\nThe term euthanasia refers to the practice of ending some one’s life in a painless manner. Euthanasia is precisely defined as \"a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering\". The term euthanasia is derived from the Greek terms eu meaning good and thanatos meaning death\nEuthanasia generally classified as active or passive, and classified as either voluntary or involuntary. In active euthanasia patient is served to death by injecting with poison, providing overdose medicine etc. In passive euthanasia patient is withdrawn of any medical treatment or facility which causes patient death.\nThe difference between active and passive euthanasia is that, in active euthanasia, something is done to end the patient's life; in passive euthanasia, something is not done that would have saved the patient’s life. Voluntary euthanasia and involuntary euthanasia is when the act of ending life is performed with and without the consent knowledge and request of patient respectively. In assisted suicide as the name describes, a physician provides a patient with the means to end his own life, but the doctor does not administer it.\nANALYSIS IN ARTHUR LEFF’S ARTICLE “GRAND SEZ WHO” FRAMEWORK\nIt is commonly argued that passive euthanasia can be allowed as legal and permissible but in practice it can hardly be differentiated from active form of killing. The supporters of passive euthanasia argue that since in passive euthanasia the physician do nothing or some time just remove the useless and burdensome life support system that is why passive euthanasia is allowed. But, it is like about the child who says to his teacher, \"Do you think it is right to punish someone for something that he did not do?\" the teacher replies \"Why, of course not,” the child says \"Good,\", \"Because I did not do my homework”\nThe most common method of euthanasia in the United States today is withholding food and fluids. In other words, the patient is starved to death and it is classified as passive euthanasia. But we have many laws that penalize people for what they did not do as to decide not to pay income taxes, or not to send children to school, or not to obey rules and regulations and many many more. [3]\nThe arguments in favor of passive euthanasia is to relieve unbearable pain may not be valid and passive euthanasia should not be allowed due to unbearable pain to relieve the suffering of the patient as the justification for this doing so is that the patient is in terrible agony, and since he is going to die anyway, it would be wrong to prolong his suffering needlessly. But if one imply to withhold treatment, it may take the patient longer to die, and so he may suffer more than he would if noire direct action were taken and a lethal injection given. This fact provides strong reason for thinking that, once the initial decision not to prolong his agony has been made active euthanasia is actually preferable to passive euthanasia.\nIt is argued that not to resuscitate a 500 gram baby? Do the high mortality and the risk for disability make this unworthy? As in the last few years there has been major progress in the field of biomedical sciences and particularly in the field of neonatal care. Nowadays many babies can survive who would have died some years ago in the 80 the survival limit was about 30 weeks. Arguments made by those in favor of the legalization of physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia often rely upon the idea of the quality of life. This idea states that an individual’s life is not valuable as an intrinsic good, but is only good based upon the things which it allows us to do. It thus allows the argument that it is morally permissible to kill individuals whose lives have fallen below an acceptable ‘quality of life’.” When we say “quality of life” we should mean “acceptance of life”. But is that measurable? Who is going to decide that quality of life? And how? And is it right to measure it by proxy? We cannot put ourselves in the baby’s shoes without confusing life acceptance (what the baby feels) with life acceptability.\nProponents of euthanasia in favor argue that euthanasia should be allowed due to unbearable pain but what is unbearable to some people, is good to others, nowadays life is “unacceptable” in western countries without tap water or electricity in the houses, but this discomfort was commonly accepted only few years ago; life can be unacceptable after a heartbreak, but many people accept not to be married. A sure prognosis is impossible and it is not human to kill people because they are disabled, neither is pain a good reason, and pain is curable, non acceptance of life is often reversible or only supposed.\nAdvocates of euthanasia also argue that the process of death that is how we die is just a private matter. But it is not possible because each person’s death necessarily involves others as euthanasia is an act that requires two people to make it possible, including healthcare professionals, and societal values and symbols.\nProponents of euthanasia argue that euthanasia allows terminally ill people to die with dignity and without pain and state that society should permit people to opt for euthanasia if they so wish. Proponents also state that individuals should be free to dictate the time and place of their own death. They argue that forcing people to live against their wishes violates personal freedoms and human rights and that it is immoral to compel people to continue to live with unbearable pain and suffering. But who says that life is an individual’s property rather life is a gift from its creator (God) and only God has the power to take it away. As individuals do not decide when and how they are born, therefore, they should not be allowed to decide how and when they die. Allowing euthanasia for this purpose could lead to an abuse of power where people might be euthanized when they do not actually wish to die.\nProponents of euthanasia argue that the decision to end a life of pain and suffering is an expression of one’s right to personal autonomy, which should be respected by one’s family, healthcare providers and society at large. But we live in an interdependent society, where one’s decisions will impact on others physically, emotionally and financially, therefore limits should be placed on personal autonomy.\nIt is argued for euthanasia that it provides a way to relieve extreme pain but modern medicine has the ability to control pain. A person who seeks to kill him or herself to avoid pain does not need legalized assisted suicide but a doctor better trained in alleviating the pain.\nIt is commonly argued that euthanasia provides a way of relief when a person’s quality of life is low, Instead of relief and insuring quality of life Euthanasia devalues human life as the poor’s, handicapped individuals and aged people will be considered of low quality and they all will be killed to insure their quality of life and to provide relief to them. People who argue in favor of euthanasia often say that it is already considered permissible to take human life under some circumstances such as self defense, but they miss the point that when one kills for self defense they are saving innocent life either their own or someone else. With euthanasia no one’s life is being saved and life is only taken.\nCONCLUSION\nAs secular ethics is based on freethinking, logic and reasoning by human beings, only these proponents though may not be contrasting to religion but they are not acceptable every time and in every situation. The idea of secular ethics may be valid for identifying problems but secular ethics fails to solve and answer many problems. Every time human beings pass any judgment it can be challenged and in fact every time it is challenged, which creates problems rather than solving the issue and only scriptural decisions and supernatural revelation is perfect which cannot be challenged by any other.\nREFERENCES\n1. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia (Accessed 22 Jan 2010).\n2.

Legal and normalised in some countries while totally taboo in others, it remains one of the key ethical debates at the juncture where politics meets philosophy.\nAlso known as assisted suicide, euthanasia involves “administering a lethal dosage of a certain medication, or ending all life support means, and letting a person who is terminally ill pass away at their own will,” says blog Flow Psychology.\nMany believe that allowing a person who is terminally ill and in pain to pass away at their own will is morally right, but those opposed to the practice on religious, moral, and ethical grounds argue that nature must be allowed to take its course.\nHere are some of the main arguments for and against legalising euthanasia:\nPros:\nAn end to suffering\nIn a 1996 US Supreme Court case regarding assisted suicide, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that the right of a mentally competent person facing a terminal illness to choose “a timely and dignified death”, rather than suffer excuciating pain in their final days, should be seen as “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty”.\nAllowing patients to end their suffering is not only morally justified but also essential to upholding the right to personal and bodily autonomy, advocates argue.\nA “categorical ban on physician assistance to suicide… substantially interferes with this protected liberty interest and cannot be sustained”, the ACLU said.\nDeath with dignity\nPeople in the late stage of terminal illness often end up bedridden and reliant on nurses and relatives for simple tasks such as eating, bathing and going to the toilet, which can be degrading.\nBack in 2008, a woman suffering from terminal multiple sclerosis that had left her unable to take care of herself told The Daily Telegraph that such an existence was “torture”.\n“If I was Spooky, my cat, I’d have been put down long ago,” she said.\nGiving dying people the opportunity to choose when and how they die allows them to take control of their life and how they are remembered by their loved ones.\nEliminating fear of financial burden\nA survey in the US state of Oregon, where assisted dying is legal, showed that 66% of euthanasia requests involved patients who did not want to be a financial burden, according to the New Zealand-based Life Information Website.\nInadequate funding for palliative care and pain management, and governments’ reliance on nursing homes, all contribute to the despair felt by many who reach old age, endure frustrating physical limitations, or are afflicted with debilitating conditions, the site says.\nHowever, it adds, euthanasia opponents argue that the “ provision of adequate pain management and hospice (palliative) care could improve quality of life and eliminate the demand for euthanasia”.\nCons:\nCorruption\nMany believe that legalising euthanasia would put too much power in the hands of doctors, who could abuse their position.\nRita Marker, executive director of the International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide, says: “Laws against euthanasia and assisted suicide are in place to prevent abuse and to protect people from unscrupulous doctors and others. They are not, and never have been, intended to make anyone suffer.\n“Euthanasia and assisted suicide are not about the right to die. They are about the right to kill.”\n‘Slippery slope’\nOpponents also argue that normalising euthanasia would be a philophical slippery slope to legalised murder.\nEdmund Pelligrino, a professor emeritus of medicine and medical ethics at Washington DC-based Georgetown University, says that “in a society as obsessed with the costs of healthcare and the principle of utility, the dangers of the slippery slope are far from fantasy”.\nHe continues: “If terminating life is a benefit, the reasoning goes, why should euthanasia be limited only to those who can give consent? Why need we ask for consent?”\nReligious concerns\nMany religious people, especially Catholics, believe that life is the ultimate gift and that taking that away is usurping power that belongs to God only. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops opposes euthanasia on the grounds that life is “a gift over which we have stewardship but not absolute dominion”.\nThe Catholic tradition “clearly and strongly affirms that as a responsible steward of life one must never directly intend to cause one’s own death, or the death of an innocent victim, by action or omission”, the assembly concludes.\nREAD SOURCE\nApril 19, 2022", "AddThis Utility Frame\nHome/Health/General/ Difference Between Euthanasia and Physician Assisted\nDifference Between Euthanasia and Physician Assisted\nJune 1, 2012 Posted by Admin\nEuthanasia vs Physician Assisted\nThere is a lot of debate whether a terminally ill man or woman should be allowed to die through mercy killing known as Euthanasia. There are both proponents as well as opponents of Euthanasia and physician assisted suicide. Whether or not a person should be allowed to choose death over life is a debate whose outcome can have serious repercussions on relationships in a family, the bond between a doctor and his patients and the basic human instincts. Many people do not know the subtle difference between euthanasia and physician assisted suicide though the outcome of both is the same, ending misery for the person who is terminally ill and does not want to remain hooked up to life prolonging machines. Let us find out the differences.\nWhile Euthanasia is banned in most countries and all states in US, it is physician assisted dying or PAD that has been allowed in some states such as Oregon, Montana, Washington, etc on grounds of compassion. In Euthanasia, it is the doctor or the physician who administers the lethal medication that would end the life of the person, but in physician assisted suicide, the patient, with the help and assistance of the doctor, administers the dose himself. In physician assisted suicide, the patient decides whether and when to take this step whereas, in Euthanasia, it is the doctor who takes this decision as the patient is not in a position to be able to think about suicide or take his life in his own hands.\nReligious affiliations have traditionally come in the way of euthanasia and mercy killing. Most Christians believe that ending one’s own life should not be allowed under any circumstances though liberal Protestants have been sympathetic to the cause and even supportive of the issue.\nPhysician assisted suicide is also labeled as voluntary active euthanasia. This is mercy killing where the patient is aware of the act and even decides the timing and means to end his life. The means such as lethal dose of medication are made available to the terminally ill patient, and he takes it with the help of the physician. PAD or physician assisted suicide is said to be emotionally easier on the doctor as he is not directly causing death of the patient and is merely fulfilling the desire of the patient by supplying him with the lethal dose of the medication that would end his life. Physician assisted suicide has the benefit of allowing the patient to change his mind even at the last minute.\nWhat is the difference between Euthanasia and Physician Assisted Suicide?\n• The objective of both Euthanasia and physician assisted suicide is the same, and that is to end the life of a terminally ill patient who does not wish to remain hooked to life prolonging machines.\n• In Euthanasia, doctor administers the lethal dose of medication with to without the consent of the patient to end the life of the patient.\n• Euthanasia is not legal in any state in US.\n• Physician assisted suicide is a type of euthanasia where the patient decides when to have medication that would end his life and the physician helps him in taking that dose\n• Physician assisted dying (PAD) is legal in some states of US such as Oregon, Washington, and Montana.\n• PAD is emotionally easier for the doctor as he feels he is merely helping in fulfilling the desire of the patient by supplying the medication.\nAbout the Author:"]}
{"query_id": "58", "generated_response": "# Nuclear Energy: Comprehensive Overview\n\n## Nuclear Energy Pros and Cons\n\n### **Major Advantages**\n\n**Low Carbon Emissions**: Nuclear power plants produce no greenhouse gas emissions during operation and have lifecycle emissions comparable to wind power, with one-third the emissions of solar [1][4]. Nuclear energy prevents approximately 528 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from being released annually [1].\n\n**High Energy Density**: Nuclear fission releases energy that is ten million times greater than burning fossil fuels, making it incredibly efficient [1][3]. A single nuclear plant can generate enough electricity for about half a million people [3].\n\n**Reliable Baseload Power**: Unlike solar and wind, nuclear energy operates continuously regardless of weather conditions, producing power 93% of the time [4]. Nuclear plants can run for over a year without stopping for maintenance [2][5].\n\n**Cost-Effective Operation**: While expensive to build, nuclear energy is cheap to operate, costing 33-50% of a coal plant and 20-25% of a gas plant to run [5]. Operating costs are significantly lower than fossil fuels once constructed [1][6].\n\n### **Major Disadvantages**\n\n**High Upfront Costs**: Construction costs have risen dramatically, from $2-4 billion in 2002 to $9 billion by 2008, with projects often exceeding estimates [6]. Building a single reactor can cost over $6 billion [5].\n\n**Radioactive Waste**: Nuclear plants generate approximately 20 metric tons of highly radioactive waste annually that remains dangerous for thousands of years [3][4]. The U.S. has been searching for permanent storage solutions since 1982 without success [1].\n\n**Accident Risk**: While rare, nuclear accidents can be catastrophic, as demonstrated by Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island [1][2][3]. The Chernobyl disaster resulted in thousands of deaths and long-term health impacts [1][6].\n\n**Non-Renewable**: Nuclear energy depends on uranium, which is finite. Current reserves are estimated to last 70-80 years at current consumption rates [2][6].\n\n## Safety and Accident Risks\n\nNuclear energy has strict safety measures, but accidents remain a significant concern [1]. The industry's safety record includes:\n\n- **Chernobyl (1986)**: The worst nuclear accident in history, causing thousands of deaths and creating a 19-mile exclusion zone that remains restricted over 30 years later [1]\n- **Fukushima (2011)**: Demonstrated that even modern plants with safety features can fail during natural disasters [3][6]\n- **Three Mile Island (1978)**: Led to a temporary halt in nuclear development [3]\n\nHowever, studies show that fossil fuel industries are statistically more deadly than nuclear, even including major accidents [1].\n\n## Climate Change Impact\n\nNuclear energy plays a crucial role in combating climate change [9][10]. Key climate benefits include:\n\n- **Deep Decarbonization**: Experts conclude that achieving the 1.5°C climate target would be much harder without increased nuclear energy [9][10]\n- **Large-Scale Deployment**: Nuclear can directly replace fossil fuel plants at the scale and speed required for climate action [9][10]\n- **Current Impact**: Nuclear use today avoids emissions equivalent to removing one-third of all cars worldwide [9][10]\n- **Proven Track Record**: France generates over 70% of its electricity from nuclear power, achieving emissions one-sixth of the European average [9][10]\n\n## Nuclear Fission vs. Fusion\n\n### **Current Nuclear Fission**\nUses uranium or plutonium atoms split through chain reactions to generate heat and electricity [1]. This is the technology powering all current nuclear plants.\n\n### **Nuclear Fusion (Future Technology)**\nNuclear fusion, which powers the sun, involves fusing hydrogen atoms to create helium and massive amounts of energy [7][8]. Fusion offers several advantages:\n\n- **Cleaner**: No long-lived radioactive waste [8]\n- **Safer**: No risk of meltdown [8]\n- **Abundant Fuel**: Uses hydrogen isotopes that are virtually limitless [8]\n- **Higher Energy Output**: Could provide practically unlimited energy [1][8]\n\nHowever, fusion remains experimental. Companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems and TAE Technologies are working toward commercial fusion, but viable plants are still years away [8].\n\n## Peninsula Clean Energy\n\nPeninsula Clean Energy is a Community Choice Aggregation agency serving San Mateo County and Los Banos, California [14][15]. Key details:\n\n**Energy Mix**: Provides 100% carbon-free electricity that is 50% renewable for ECOplus service and 100% renewable for ECO100 [15]. Their 2020 energy sources included:\n- 51.7% eligible renewables (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, small hydro) [15]\n- 46.7% large hydroelectric [15]\n- 1.1% nuclear [15]\n\n**Cost Savings**: Offers 5% savings compared to PG&E rates while providing cleaner energy [14]\n\n**Renewable Goals**: Targeting 100% renewable energy by 2025 and 24/7 renewable power [13][14][15]\n\n**Recent Developments**: Has secured multiple solar-plus-storage projects and a 35-MW geothermal agreement with The Geysers complex [13][16]\n\n## Bison Energy\n\nBison Energy Group is a renewable energy development company with offices in Japan, Australia, Korea, and Italy [17][18][19]. Their focus areas include:\n\n**Solar Development**: Developing solar farms across multiple countries, with projects like the 300MW WallaWalla Solar Farm in Australia (sold to Fotowatio) [18]\n\n**Project Portfolio**: Has 489.7 MW AC capacity and 613.55 MW DC capacity in development across 9 projects in Australia [18]\n\n**Geographic Presence**: Active in renewable energy development across Asia-Pacific and Europe [17][19]\n\nNote: Bison Energy focuses on solar and renewable energy, not nuclear power [20].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNuclear energy presents a complex energy option with significant benefits for climate action but substantial challenges regarding cost, waste, and safety. While current nuclear fission technology provides reliable, low-carbon electricity, future fusion technology could revolutionize energy production. Organizations like Peninsula Clean Energy are transitioning toward renewable sources, while companies like Bison Energy focus on solar development, reflecting the diverse approaches to clean energy transition.", "citations": ["https://www.solarreviews.com/blog/nuclear-energy-pros-and-cons\n", "https://kiwienergy.us/pros-and-cons-of-nuclear-energy/\n", "https://ecavo.com/nuclear-energy-pros-cons/\n", "https://www.energysage.com/about-clean-energy/nuclear-energy/pros-and-cons-nuclear-energy/\n", "https://data-orchid.com/nuclear-energy/", "https://springpowerandgas.us/the-pros-cons-of-nuclear-energy-is-it-safe/\n", "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/02/nuclear-fission-and-fusion-could-be-integral-to-a-carbon-free-future.html", "https://blog.infinitiventures.io/nuclear-energy-fission-fusion-and/", "https://world-nuclear.org/focus/climate-change/nuclear-in-a-clean-energy-future/how-can-nuclear-combat-climate-change.aspx", "https://www.world-nuclear.org/nuclear-essentials/how-can-nuclear-combat-climate-change.aspx\n", "https://www.peninsulacleanenergy.com/procurement/", "https://www.peninsulacleanenergy.com/energy-sources/", "https://electricenergyonline.com/article/energy/category/ev-storage/143/930165/peninsula-clean-energy-reaches-100-mw-solar-50-mw-storage-purchase-deal.html", "https://www.peninsulacleanenergy.com/\n", "https://www.peninsulacleanenergy.com/power-mix/\n", "https://renewablesnow.com/news/peninsula-clean-energy-seals-35-mw-geothermal-ppa-with-geysers-operator-753275/", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/bisonenergygroup", "https://www.bisonenergy.net/Projects.aspx?ID=1", "http://www.bisonenergy.net/Default.aspx\n", "https://www.juwiamericas.com/portfolio_page/bison-solar/"], "contexts": ["Nuclear Energy Pros and Cons\nHome>\nBlog>\nNuclear energy pros and cons\nNuclear energy pros and cons\nUpdated 12/29/2021\nWhen it comes to nuclear energy, does the good outweigh the bad?\nNuclear energy might be one of the most controversial energy sources we have. For some people, the potential risk associated with nuclear power is too great. For others, nuclear looks like the answer for a zero-carbon future.\nDespite being hotly debated, nuclear energy still makes up almost 20% of the United States’ total energy generation.\nWe’re going to take a closer look at nuclear power, so you can better understand the pros and cons of this energy source.\nOn this page\nNuclear power pros and cons\nWhat is nuclear energy?\nAdvantages\nLow cost\nReliable\nZero carbon emissions\nPromising future\nHigh energy density\nDisadvantages\nEnvironmental impact\nWater intensive\nRisk of accidents\nRadioactive waste\nNon-renewable\nFuture of nuclear energy\n... Show more\nPros and cons of nuclear power\nNuclear energy comes with many benefits and drawbacks, which is what makes it such a controversial alternative energy source. Here are the main nuclear energy pros and cons:\nPros and cons of nuclear energy\nPros\nCons\nLow-cost energy\nEnvironmental impact\nReliable power source\nWater intensive\nZero-carbon emissions\nRisk of nuclear accidents\nPromising energy future\nRadioactive waste\nHigh energy density\nNon-renewable energy source\nWhat is nuclear energy?\nNuclear energy has been powering the United States for over 60 years. But how exactly do nuclear power plants generate electricity?\nNuclear energy is formed by splitting uranium or plutonium atoms through chain reactions in a nuclear reactor by a process called ‘nuclear fission’. The energy released from splitting the atoms is used to heat water into steam. This steam then turns a turbine, which creates usable electricity.\nExperts believe that thorium is another fuel that could be used for nuclear power. It’s already being used in countries like India and Russia.\nAdvantages of nuclear energy\n1. Low-cost energy\nAlthough building nuclear power plants has a high initial cost, it’s relatively cheap to produce energy from them and they have low operating costs.\nAlso, nuclear power doesn’t experience the same kind of price fluctuations that traditional fossil fuel energy sources like coal and natural gas do. Because of that, the price of nuclear energy can be predicted well into the future.\nThat price is likely to remain low, or get even lower, as technologies advance.\n2. Reliable\nOne of the biggest benefits of nuclear energy is that it is a reliable power generation source.\nUnlike solar and wind energy, which need the sun to be shining or the wind to be blowing, nuclear power can be generated at any time throughout the day. This means that a nuclear power plant can produce energy nonstop, and you won’t have to experience any delays in energy production.\n3. Zero carbon emissions\nNuclear power reactors do not produce any carbon emissions. This is a huge advantage over traditional sources of energy, like fossil fuels, which releases tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\nExcess carbon dioxide is one the leading causes of climate change. So, the less carbon and greenhouse gas emissions an energy source has, the better.\nIn fact, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), nuclear electricity production prevents 528 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere annually.\nTry our solar cost calculator and find out how much you could save while reducing your carbon footprint\nCalculate Now\n4. Promising future energy supply\nNuclear fusion is the holy grail of harnessing energy. If we can learn to control atomic fusion (the same reactions as those that fuel the sun), we could practically have unlimited energy.\nAt the moment, this method has some serious challenges that need to be worked out if we are to start using them on a larger scale. However, the potential it has is important to keep in mind when thinking about energy generation in the future.\n5. High energy density\nIt is estimated that the amount of energy released in a nuclear fission reaction is ten million times greater than the amount released when burning fossil fuels.\nTherefore, the amount of nuclear fuel required in a nuclear power plant is much smaller compared to those of other types of power plants. This helps contribute to the low cost of nuclear energy. One nuclear power plant can produce thousands of megawatt hours of energy.\nDisadvantages of nuclear energy\nWhile there are many advantages to using nuclear energy,  there are also plenty of negative effects of nuclear energy. The following are the most important ones:\n1. Environmental impact\nAlthough nuclear power plants release zero carbon emissions, nuclear power still has a substantial impact on the environment, mainly through mining and water discharge.\nThe uranium used to produce nuclear energy has to be mined. Mining of any kind has a negative impact on the surrounding area. Uranium mining in particular is known for releasing arsenic and radon. This has had a negative impact on the health of those living around uranium mines, which consists largely of members of the Navajo nation.\nNuclear power plants also cause something called ‘thermal pollution’. Most nuclear power plants are located on a body of water, like a lake or the ocean. The power plant uses water from the lake or ocean, referred to as cooling water, to condense steam back into water.\nThis process causes the cooling water to increase in temperature, and is then released back into the body of water. This hot water, usually around 100 degrees fahrenheit, significantly changes the chemistry of the ocean or lake it is discharged into, making it inhabitable to most aquatic life.\n2. Water intensive\nNuclear power plants require a lot of water to produce energy. In 2015, the United States consumed 320 billion gallons of water to produce nuclear power. That’s more water than what is used for coal processing.\nAs water becomes more scarce, especially in the face of climate change, this enormous consumption of water could become unsustainable.\n3. Risk of nuclear accidents\nNuclear power plants have very strict safety measures in place. However, accidents can happen no matter how careful you are. A meltdown at a nuclear plant can have a catastrophic impact on the surrounding areas, which we know from events like the Fukushima disaster, Chernobyl, and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.\nIn the event of a nuclear meltdown, harmful radiation can leak, which can cause adverse effects on the environment and on human health. The 1986 incident at Chernobyl ultimately led to thousands of deaths, with estimates ranging from 4,000 to 60,000 dead as a result of the incident. Not only that, more than 2 million people are still struggling with health problems related to Chernobyl. Today, over 30 years later, access is still limited within the 19-mile Chernobyl exclusion zone.\nIt is important to keep in mind, however, that these types of accidents are rare. Plus, many studies show that the fossil fuel industry is substantially more deadly than the nuclear industry, even when you include catastrophes like Chernobyl.\n4. Radioactive waste\nGenerating nuclear power does not emit harmful greenhouse gases in the air, however, it does create hazardous waste. The waste created by nuclear power plants remains dangerously radioactive for thousands of years after it is created. Many issues arise when trying to figure out how to store this radioactive waste.\nWaste continues to accumulate at nuclear power plants, as there is no long-term storage facility for it. The accumulation of hazardous nuclear waste will become an issue once power plants run out storage space.\nPlus, if there is a compromise in the storage facility, such as a leak, the radioactive material could cause significant damage to surrounding areas. The federal government started looking for a place stable enough for nuclear waste disposal in 1982, however, no such site has been found.\n5. Non-renewable\nA renewable energy resource is defined as a source of energy that is not depleted when it is used, or that can be replenished within a human lifetime. Solar power is an example of a renewable resource because as we turn solar energy into usable electricity, we do not decrease the power of the sun.\nNuclear energy, on the other hand, is a non-renewable energy source. This is because the fuel used in nuclear reactors, uranium, is a finite resource. As we mine uranium, we deplete the amount that is available, and more will not be produced within a human lifetime.\nRight now, experts believe that there is about 200 years’ worth of uranium available, assuming we stay at the same rate of nuclear production. But, if we become more reliant on nuclear power in the future, the supply of uranium will deplete faster, which may cause problems in the years ahead.\nThe future of nuclear energy\nAs you can see, there are many arguments both for and against nuclear power. With further technological advances, this zero-carbon energy source could help us reach a clean energy future.\nYou may see new plants show up in the future. However, other forms of energy like geothermal, wind energy, and solar power, are truly renewable and could lead us to a greener future.\nYou can power your home on renewable energy now by installing solar panels. When you pair solar panels with energy storage, you can run your home on solar even when the sun isn’t shining. Plus, installing solar panels can completely eliminate your utility bill!\nUse our solar calculator to find out how much a solar system could save you.\nHow much money can a solar roof save you?\nCalculate Now\nKey takeaways\nWhen uranium or plutonium atoms are split through nuclear fission, the energy released during the reaction is used to heat water into steam. The steam turns a turbine and creates usable nuclear electricity.\nThe advantages of nuclear energy are that it produces low-cost energy, it is reliable, it releases zero carbon emissions, there is a promising future for nuclear technology, and it has a high energy density.\nThe main disadvantages of nuclear energy include its environmental impact, it is extremely water-intensive, there is a risk of nuclear accidents, management of radioactive waste is problematic, and it is non-renewable.\nNuclear energy is one of the most controversial energy sources, but it is critical in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.\nLooking for lists of pros and cons for other types of energy sources?\nSolar energy pros and cons\nGeothermal energy pros and cons\nHydroelectric energy pros and cons\nBiomass energy pros and cons\nTidal energy pros and cons\nWave energy pros and cons\nFossil fuels pros and cons\nNuclear energy pros and cons\nCatherine is a researcher and content specialist at SolarReviews.

When you’re presented with the words “nuclear energy”, some of the first images that may pop in your head might be of a nuclear bomb or of an energy crisis such as Fukushima or Chernobyl. If these are your impressions of nuclear energy, then you’ll be surprised to learn that, when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions and other air pollutants, nuclear energy is nearly equal to other renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar.\nWhen it comes to nuclear energy, there are many advantages and disadvantages to consider. To help you better understand this energy source, this post will focus on the pros and cons of nuclear energy. But before we dive into these pros and cons, let’s first discuss what nuclear energy is.\nWhat exactly is nuclear energy?\nIn simple terms, it is leveraging nuclear reactors that release their own energy in order to generate heat, which is then used in steam turbines to create electricity in power plants. This type of energy is used worldwide, and in fact, the United States is the greatest producer of nuclear energy, although due to its large size, only 19% of its electricity comes from this source.\nThere are many pros and cons of nuclear energy, both of which are important to understand in order for you to be able to establish whether you feel that this energy source could be beneficial for the future of our planet.\nPros of Nuclear Energy\n1. Produces Low Pollution\nIn comparison to coal, gas, and other electric-generating plants, nuclear offers the lowest by far in greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), nuclear produces more clean-air energy than any energy source altogether and is responsible for producing 62% of all emission-free electricity in the United States\n2. Low Cost\nOnce they are up and running, electricity generated by nuclear plant reactors is far less expensive than coal, gas, or any other fossil fuel plant for that matter. Nearly all of the cost is upfront and maintaining the plant is fairly cheap. Additionally, most nuclear power plants have an average life cycle of 40-60 years, which, when combined with the low operating costs, far outweigh the high upfront costs to build.\n3. Reliability\nUnlike other renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar for example, which are dependent on weather conditions, nuclear energy has no such constraints and is unaffected by external climatic factors, which is great in times of natural disasters. A nuclear power plant is able to therefore create a steady and predictable energy output and is considered the highest national average reliability.\n4. High Energy Density\nThe amount of fuel required in a nuclear power plant is much smaller compared to those of other types of power plants. This is because the amount of energy released in a nuclear fission reaction is ten million times greater than the amount released in burning a fossil fuel atom (such as oil and gas)\n5. Sufficient Fuel Availability\nSuch as are fossil fuels, the uranium used to supply nuclear power plants is in limited supply. However, fossil fuels have a more limited lifespan than our uranium reserves, which are estimated to last an additional 80 years.\nCons of Nuclear Energy\n1. Expensive Initial Cost to Build\nConstruction of a new nuclear plant can take anywhere from 5-10 years to build, costing billions of dollars. As discussed in the pros of nuclear energy section above, nuclear plants are cheap and efficient for generating electricity while operating, so much of the initial upfront cost to build (and more) is recouped throughout the lifetime of the plant, but it’s understandable that some nations might be reluctant to pursue.  Although the pros usually outweigh the cons, the cost can be a major deterrent for countries looking to build new plants.\n2. Risk of Accident\nChernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima Daiichi are disasters that nobody wants to experience ever again under any circumstances. However, accidents do happen. In all of these major nuclear incidents, it was human error or a natural disaster that led to the downfall of the power plants. To err is human, after all, and currently, there is no way to control or prevent natural disasters. Since nuclear energy is operated by humans, it’s unrealistic to expect that the possibility of an accident does not exist\n3. Radioactive Waste\nEven though nuclear energy production doesn’t emit any emissions, it does produce radioactive waste that must be securely stored so it doesn’t pollute the environment. Although in small quantities, radiation isn’t harmful, the radioactive waste from nuclear energy production is quite dangerous.\n4. Limited Fuel Supply\nNuclear energy is not a renewable energy source. Uranium is in limited (although as aforementioned, currently abundant) supply. Even though it’s not a fossil fuel, the risk that uranium will eventually run out still exists. Whereas renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are in infinite supply, uranium has to be mined, synthesized, then activated to produce energy. This is a relatively expensive process\n5. Impact on the Environment\nIn addition to the waste that they produce, nuclear power plants create other impacts to the environment. For example, the mining and enrichment of uranium are not environmentally friendly processes. Although open-pit mining for uranium is safe for miners, the process leaves behind radioactive particles, which can cause erosion, and even pollute nearby sources of water\nNow that you know a little bit more about nuclear energy and have familiarized yourself with some of the pros and cons of this energy source, we hope that you are able to responsibly make your own decision about whether you think it’s a viable choice for our future energy needs or not.

(Explained)\nThe Advantages and Disadvantages of Nuclear Energy (Pros & Cons)\nNovember 19, 2016\nEcavo.com\nNuclear energy is a hot topic in today’s world. Burning of fossil fuel reserves isn’t going to last forever.\nRenewable energy sources such as solar and wind haven’t yet proven themselves as viable solutions to meet the population’s wide-scale energy needs.\nWith constantly growing energy demands, it’s imperative we explore nuclear as a dependable energy source.\nThe process used to produce nuclear energy is called fission. Nuclear fission occurs when the atom of a nucleus is split, releasing very large amounts of energy.\nIn nuclear power plants, atoms are continuously split, creating chain reactions that provide high amounts of sustainable energy for a long period of time.\nNuclear energy, much like other power sources, certainly doesn’t come without its drawbacks and can be open to consistent criticism.\nDisposal of radioactive waste, the worry of nuclear meltdown (like Chernobyl & Fukushima most recently), high up-front construction costs, and public safety are key factors that need to be evaluated.\nPros of Nuclear Energy\nCons of Nuclear Energy\nLow Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nBack-End Environmental Impact\nHigh Power Output\nPast History Of Nuclear Accidents\nInexpensive Electricity\nHigh Up-Front And End Stage Cost\nNuclear Energy Doesn’t Rely On Fossil Fuels\nTarget For Terrorism\nEconomic Impact\nNot A Renewable Fuel Source\nLet’s take a closer look at some of the major pros and cons of nuclear energy.\nAdvantages of Nuclear Energy (Pros)\nLow Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nHigh Power Output\nInexpensive Electricity\nNuclear Energy Doesn’t Rely On Fossil Fuels\nEconomic Impact\nAfter the meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1978 and the Chernobyl explosion in 1986, the nuclear industry fell dormant.\nQuite a few plants stopped producing power, and the construction of new plants was brought to a halt.\nSince then, a resurgence has occurred. In the age of technology, energy demands are at an all-time high, and nuclear had to be looked at as a viable source.\nBelow you will find the pros that led to the revival of nuclear energy.\nLow Greenhouse Gas Emissions.\nCompared to coal, gas, and other electric-generating plants, nuclear offers the lowest by far in greenhouse gas release.\nCarbon dioxide and similar gases, known for depleting Earth’s atmosphere, have notoriously been an issue in the climate change debate. Due to this fact, nuclear energy has once again been looked at for power production.\nAccording to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), nuclear energy produces more clean-air energy than any other source. It produces 62 percent of all emission-free electricity in the United States.\nIn nuclear reactors that utilize large cooling towers, it’s a common misconception that pollution is massively dumped into the air. The large clouds you see leaving the smoke stacks are nothing more than vaporized water.\nWe have written an article talking about the actual causes of air pollution and their effects here – Number 3 on our list is the most interesting.\nHigh Power Output.\nOne of the most appealing reasons for nuclear energy is its incredibly high fuel to power output ratio. It has the capacity to meet city and industrial needs with just one reactor, let alone multiple.\nA relatively small amount of uranium can be used to fuel a 1000 Megawatts electric plant, providing enough electricity to power a city of about half a million people.\nRenewable sources, such as solar and wind, provide only enough power to meet residential or office needs. They don’t yet have the capacity of nuclear to handle large-scale power needs, especially in the manufacturing world.\nInexpensive Electricity.\nAs we’ll discuss in the cons, initial costs to build nuclear plants are high. That said, nuclear power creates very inexpensive electricity once up and running.\nElectricity generated by nuclear reactors is cheaper than gas, coal, or any other fossil fuel plants. Also, uranium is a fairly cheap fuel source, and we’ve already covered how little of it is needed to produce massive power.\nWhen you combine all that with an average lifecycle of 40-60 years, the low operating costs far outweigh the high upfront costs to build.\nNuclear Energy Doesn’t Rely on Fossil Fuels.\nQuite possibly the most important benefit of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t rely on fossil fuels. This means it’s not affected by the unpredictability of oil and gas costs.\nIt also means that we won’t be depleting the Earth’s supply of resources nearly as quickly. Nuclear power requires much less fuel to produce a higher amount of energy.\nWith the current supply of uranium, it is estimated that we have at least another 80 years before supply becomes an issue. There are also other forms of uranium that can be used if needed, extending that timeline even further. This is plenty of time to find alternative sources (such as nuclear fusion, the holy grail of energy), if need be.\nEconomic Impact.\nNuclear power provides a vast array of benefits to the economy. Local communities are, more often than not, pro-nuclear due to the amount of jobs and prosperity a new plant brings.\nAccording to the NEI, one new nuclear plant creates 400 to 700 permanent jobs, not to mention thousands of others during its construction. Most nuclear sites have at least 2 plants. This is comparable to just 90 jobs for a coal plant, and 50 for a natural gas plant.\nThe main reason local communities are so ecstatic over nuclear plants is that each facility generates close to $500 million annually in sales of goods and services. More workers at plants means more people who need lunches and more people with money to spend.\nDisadvantages of Nuclear Energy (Cons)\nBack-End Environmental Impact\nPast History Of Nuclear Accidents\nHigh Up-Front And End Stage Cost\nTarget For Terrorism\nNot A Renewable Fuel Source\nNuclear energy has a number of positive aspects, making it appealing to more and more countries world-wide. But like all energy sources, it has its downsides.\nMany people are scared of nuclear power due to the few, although very significant, accidents that have taken place over the years.\nAnd while nuclear energy operates with little pollution to the environment, it certainly isn’t without its environmental impacts.\nLet’s now take a look at some of these cons of nuclear power.\nBack-end Environmental Impact.\nPossibly the biggest concern among nuclear energy advocates is the environmental impact of uranium as a fuel source.\nA typical nuclear power plant generates about 20 metric tons of used nuclear fuel per year. The problem is that this spent fuel is highly radioactive and potentially dangerous.\nIt’s not a fuel source you can take to a landfill and leave without worry. It has to be carefully handled and stored (which costs a lot of money), and it requires a hefty amount of specially designed storage space.\nSpent nuclear fuel takes hundreds of years to decompose before it reaches adequate levels of safety. For this reason alone, it becomes an issue that other energy sources simply don’t have to deal with.\nPast History of Nuclear Accidents.\nI listed these as numbers 1 and 2, respectively, but if I could I would have listed them as 1 and 1. While experts in the nuclear industry aren’t necessarily as concerned, the public is largely terrified of potential nuclear accidents.\nSafety is a big deal in the nuclear industry these days, and rightfully so. While significant accidents are actually incredibly rare, history cannot be ignored. And when they do happen, it’s a major problem.\nWith the Fukushima incident in Japan in 2011, the global population was reminded that nuclear still has its drawbacks. While causalities actually weren’t high, environmental impact remains an issue today.\nChernobyl is widely known as the worst nuclear accident in the history of the industry. Even though it was more than 30 years ago, the harmful effects are still present to this day, especially to local inhabitants.\nHigh Up-Front and End Stage Cost.\nWe’ve already discussed how cheap and efficient nuclear plants generate electricity while operating. Usually, the pros outweigh the cons; however, cost can be a major deterrent for countries looking to build new plants.\nConstruction of a new plant can take anywhere from 5-10 years to build, costing billions of dollars. Much of that and more is recouped throughout the lifetime of the plant, but you can see how some nations might be reluctant to pursue.\nOn the back end, high fuel handling and decommissioning costs aren’t anything to scoff at, either. For the long haul though, if you can stomach it, nuclear energy almost always pays dividends.\nTarget for Terrorism.\nMost people who hear the word “nuclear” immediately think of the nuclear weapon bomb and Hiroshima. While nuclear power plant generation is certainly different from weapons of mass destruction, it represents a threat to national security if exposed to dangerous people.\nUranium used to power nuclear plants is of a different grade than weapons-grade uranium; however, it can be synthesized from it.\nNuclear technology in the wrong hands presents a problem for most of the free world. Even though security is tight and the probability of an event is low, it’s still something to consider that you don’t necessarily have to worry about with other traditional sources.\nNot a Renewable Fuel Source.\nLast but certainly not least, nuclear energy is not a renewable fuel source.\nContrary to popular belief, Uranium is in limited (although currently abundant) supply. While not a fossil fuel, we still run the risk of running out eventually.\nTypical renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy are in infinite supply. Uranium has to be mined, synthesized, then activated to generate nuclear energy, and it’s very expensive to go through this process.\nThis alone is one of the big reasons people are trying so hard to make renewables acceptable in meeting our world’s energy demands.\nConclusion\nMore often than not, the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to nuclear energy.\nIt has very low operating costs, produces sufficient energy to meet demand, and has a variety of other economic benefits that can’t be ignored.\nWhile accidents and the environmental impact of spent fuel need to be considered, we simply don’t have any better options for long-term mass energy production.\nIf better solutions come along, the future of nuclear energy will have to be re-examined.\nVery smart people, such as Elon Musk, are working hard to make renewables (solar, wind, etc.) a part of the conversation for long-term sustainable power. New, exciting technology continues to come out on a day-to-day basis.\nFor now though, nuclear remains as one of the only viable options to solving Earth’s increasing energy needs.\nWhat do you think?\nResources\nhttp://www.nei.org/Master-Document-Folder/Backgrounders/Fact-Sheets/Quick-Facts-Nuclear-Energy-in-America\nhttp://www.nei.org/Knowledge-Center/Nuclear-Statistics/On-Site-Storage-of-Nuclear-Waste\nhttp://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/economic-aspects/economics-of-nuclear-power.aspx\nFeatured Image Credit: Global Panorama @ Flickr", "Pros And Cons of Nuclear Energy |  EnergySage\nRenewable energy | Nuclear energy | Nuclear energy pros and cons\nNuclear energy pros and cons\nLast updated 11/10/2021\nAs with any energy source, renewable or non-renewable, there are pros and cons to using nuclear energy. We’ll review some of these top benefits and drawbacks to keep in mind when comparing nuclear to other energy sources.\nTop pros and cons of nuclear energy\nDespite limited development of nuclear power plants recently, nuclear energy still supplies about 20 percent of U.S. electricity. As with any energy source, it comes with various advantages and disadvantages. Here are just a few top ones to keep in mind:\nPros and cons of nuclear power\nPros of nuclear energy\nCons of nuclear energy\nCarbon-free electricity\nUranium is technically non-renewable\nSmall land footprint\nVery high upfront costs\nHigh power output\nNuclear waste\nReliable energy source\nMalfunctions can be catastrophic\nFind out what solar panels cost in your area in 2022\nEnter your zip code\nSee Solar Prices\n100% free to use, 100% online\nAccess the lowest solar prices from installers near you\nUnbiased energy advisors ready to help\nOn the pros side, nuclear energy is a carbon-free electricity source (with other environmental benefits as well!), it needs a relatively small land area to operate, and is a great energy source for reliable baseload power for the electric grid. On the cons side, nuclear is technically a non-renewable source of energy, nuclear plants have a high up-front cost associated with them, and nuclear waste and operation of nuclear plants in general poses some environmental and health challenges.\nBelow, we’ll explore these pros and cons in further detail.\nAdvantages of nuclear energy\nHere are four advantages of nuclear energy:\nCarbon-free electricity\nSmall land footprint\nHigh power output\nReliable energy source\nCarbon-free electricity\nWhile traditional fossil fuel generation sources pump massive amounts of carbon dioxide (the primary cause of global climate change) into the atmosphere, nuclear energy plants do not produce carbon dioxide, or any air pollution, during operation. That’s not to say that they don’t pollute at all, though - the process of mining, refining, and preparing uranium uses energy, and nuclear waste poses a completely separate environmental problem. We’ll discuss nuclear waste’s role in all this later on.\nSmall land footprint\nCompared to other common clean energy facilities (particularly wind and solar power), nuclear energy plants take up far less physical space. According to the Department of Energy, a typical nuclear facility producing 1,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity takes up about one square mile of space. Comparatively, a wind farm producing the same amount of energy takes 360x more land area, and a large-scale solar farm uses 75x more space. That’s 431 wind turbines or 3.125 million (!!!) solar panels. Check out this graphic from the Department of Energy for more fun comparisons of energy sources, like how many Corvettes are needed to produce the same amount of energy as one nuclear reactor.\nHigh power output\nNuclear power plants produce high levels of energy compared to most power sources (especially renewables), which makes them a great provider of baseload electricity. . “Baseload electricity” simply means the minimum level of energy demand on the grid over a span of time, say a week. Nuclear has the potential to be this high-output basload source, and we’re headed that way - since 1990, nuclear power plants have generated 20% of the US’s electricity. Additionally, nuclear is a prime candidate for replacing current baseload electricity sources that contribute significantly to air pollution, such as large coal plants.\nReliable energy source\nLastly, nuclear energy is a reliable renewable energy source based on it’s constant production and accessibility. Nuclear power plants produce at their maximum power output more often (93% of the time) than any other energy source, and because of this round-the-clock stability, this makes nuclear energy an ideal source for reliable baseload electricity for the grid.\nDisadvantages of nuclear energy\nHere are four disadvantages of nuclear energy:\nUranium is technically non-renewable\nVery high upfront costs\nNuclear waste\nMalfunctions can be catastrophic\nUranium is non-renewable\nAlthough nuclear energy is a “clean” source of power, it is technically not renewable. Current nuclear technology relies on uranium ore for fuel, which exists in limited amounts in the earth’s crust. The longer we rely on nuclear power (and uranium ore in particular) the more depleted the earth’s uranium resources will become, which will drive up the cost of extracting it, as well as the negative environmental impacts from mining and processing the uranium.\nHigh upfront costs\nOperating a nuclear energy plant is a relatively low-cost endeavor, but building it in the first place is very expensive. Nuclear reactors are complex devices that require many levels of safety built around them, which drives up the cost of new nuclear plants.\nNuclear waste\nAnd now to the thorny issue of nuclear waste – we could write hundreds of articles about the science of nuclear waste, its political implications, cost/benefit analyses, and more when it comes to this particular subject. The key takeaway from all of that would be this: nuclear waste is a complicated issue, and we won't claim to be anything near experts. Nuclear waste is radioactive, making it an environmental and health catastrophe waiting to happen. These reasons are exactly why governments spend tons of money to safely package up and dispose of used-up nuclear fuel. At the end of the day, yes, nuclear waste is a dangerous by-product of nuclear power plants, and it takes extreme care and advanced technology to handle it properly.\nMalfunctions can be catastrophic\nA nuclear meltdown occurs when the heat created by a nuclear reactor exceeds the amount of heat being transferred out by the cooling systems; this causes the system to exceed its melting point. If this happens, hot radioactive vapors can escape, which can cause nuclear plants to fully melt down and combust, while also releasing harmful radioactive materials into the environment. This is a worst-case-scenario that is extremely unlikely, and nuclear plants are equipped with numerous safety measures to prevent meltdowns from happening.\nFind out what solar panels cost in your area in 2022\nEnter your zip code\nSee Solar Prices\n100% free to use, 100% online\nAccess the lowest solar prices from installers near you\nUnbiased energy advisors ready to help\nHow much will it cost you to install solar?\nDownload our True Cost of Solar Guide for your state!", "Nuclear Energy | Nuclear Energy - Pros & Cons | Chernobyl accident\nGeneral Awareness\nNuclear Energy – Pros & Cons\nJanuary 19, 2021 Data Orchid 4 Comments\nNuclear Energy: Is it safe?\nAs humans, we seek energy in various forms. We have learned to harness energy from sun to water to wind and convert them into electricity – the key to all other means of invention for us. However, as millennials who were born with these energy sources at our disposal, we have learnt to take them for granted and never speak about them much except for occasional events of energy conservation.\nNevertheless, irrespective of our naivety about Energy sources or energy industry, we all have, at some point in our life, heard a discussion about Nuclear energy. No energy medium is discussed as much as Nuclear Energy – both in positive and negative ways.\nSo, why so much hoopla around the nuclear power source? Most of it driven by the fear of devastation that this man-made energy source can cause if things go wrong. Case in point, Chernobyl. And, Fukushima. These are incidents where a nuclear power plant leakage resulted into mass scale devastation – so much that the many people believe that the pros will outweigh the cons only based on that risk.\nThat said, the advantages of Nuclear Energy cannot be outrules easily. In this article, let us take a close look at the various advantages and disadvantages (other than the fear of destruction) of Nuclear Energy.\nAdvantages of Nuclear Energy\nLow carbon energy source\nUnlike traditional fossil fuels like coal, nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gas emissions like methane and CO2. We have a responsibility to keep powering our homes, workplaces and cities – but we also have a responsibility to the planet. For that  we need to make sure we are low-carbon and environmentally friendly. Most of the first world countries have gradually made a move towards Nuclear energy. For example, around a fifth of the UK’s electricity is generated by nuclear energy, 20% of all electricity produced in United States is through Nuclear energy.\nNot intermittent, Reliable\nThe biggest problem with preferred, renewable energy sources are that they are dependent on their source. Wind energy is generated only when there is wind blowing, solar energy gets generated when the sun is shining. Without their sources working in full force both wind and solar energy fails.\nIn that comparison, nuclear energy is much more reliable. Nuclear power plants can run without any interruptions for a more than a year.  They hardly need to stop for maintenance. This makes them a more reliable source of energy.\nLow Cost of Running\nThe fact that Nuclear Power plants run at a stretch for more than one year without stopping for maintenance, makes them very economical to run. To put it in comparison, nuclear plants cost between 33 to 50% of a coal plant and 20 to 25% of a gas combined-cycle plant.\nNow, let us look at the disadvantages of a Nuclear Power plant\nExpensive to build\nPutting up a Nuclear plant requires a lot of initial investments. Even though the cost of running a Nuclear plant is low, the initial high investment puts off many Governments. In US, setting up a single reactor in a Neuclear plant costs over $6 billion. In addition to the expense of building a power plant, nuclear plants must also allocate funds to protect the waste they produce and keep it in cooled structures with security procedures in place. All of these costs make nuclear power quite expensive.\nBecause Nuclear plants require supply of Uranium to work, many people believe that these plants are only a temporary measure and will not be able to recover the high investments that gies into building them. This is because Uranium, as a natural resource, will gradually dry up due to excessive mining if we set up a number of Nuclear plants.\nEffect on Environment\nIt has been estimated that the world produces some 34,000m3 of nuclear waste each year, waste that takes years to degrade. Every nuclear plant that opens up adds to these tremendous amounts of waste that acts as a burden to the environment. Because there’s no way to destroy nuclear waste, the current solution is to seal it securely in containers and store it deep underground where it can’t contaminate the environment. However, leakage of those containers always remains a possibility.\nBut that’s not the only harmful effect Nuclear plants have on the environment. Mining of Uranium is a hazardous process. While mines are designed open pit to keep the workers safe, it leaves behind radioactive particles, causes erosion, and even pollutes nearby sources of water.\nThreats of Accidents and Natural Calamities\nThe ‘what if…’ is a biggest apprehension for setting up a Nuclear plant. If a reactor bursts or even if there is a leakage, the amount of damage it causes to the environment and human lives is beyond repair. The Chernobyl accident in 1986 or the most recent mishap in Japan’s Fukushima has added to the fears about the aftermath of an accident.\nThere are organizations like Greenpeace who actively advocates against Nuclear Power plant. One of the primary reason of the same is its ability to cause loss of life even after years of the accident.\nThis also opens up the possibility of threats by terrorist organization or targeted by enemies in case a war breaks out. The uranium used to produce the power can be turned into nuclear weapons if they end up in the wrong hands.\nSo, while Nuclear energy has both positives and negatives, it is on Governments and international bodies to put a regulation and monitor responsible building of these plants. The geographical area where such plants are built should also be picked up responsibly to help human life and not the business investment decision that drives it. If done responsibly and handled safely, Nuclear energy can be a solution to our energy crisis in many areas. But then again, unless we can find a way to create nuclear fusion or build breeder reactors before our supply of Uranium dries up, we will only have a temporary solution of energy crisis in our hand.\nPrevious Post Hollywood and Physics\nNext Post Ayurveda Misconceptions", "The Pros & Cons of Nuclear Energy: Is it safe? - Spring Power & Gas\nThe Pros & Cons of Nuclear Energy: Is it safe?\nWhen you hear the words “nuclear energy,” what do you think of? Perhaps an image comes to mind of a nuclear bomb, or a nuclear energy crisis like Chernobyl or Fukushima. If this is your image of nuclear power, you might be surprised to learn that nuclear energy is actually considered one of the most environmentally friendly forms of energy production in the world. With fewer emissions and greater efficiency, there are many pros and cons of nuclear energy to consider.\nThere are also challenges when producing nuclear energy, including expense, safety, waste, security, and more. Learn more about the pros and cons of nuclear energy to better understand this energy source and how it might benefit our world in the future.\nWhat Is Nuclear Energy?\nBefore we jump into the pros and cons of nuclear energy, it’s helpful to know what nuclear energy is and how it’s created. Nuclear energy is created through the process of splitting atoms—specifically, uranium atoms. When the atom is split it becomes two smaller, lighter atoms. Because energy doesn’t just disappear, the “lost” mass is converted into heat, which is used to produce electricity. Nuclear power plants simply provide a controlled environment for these reactions to occur.\nNuclear Energy Pros\nThere are many pros and cons of nuclear energy, and it’s important to understand both sides to get an idea of what this energy resource is capable of. Knowing the pros and cons of nuclear energy will help you decide for yourself whether this energy resource is a good decision for our future energy needs and for the planet.\n1. Low Cost of Operation\nAfter the initial cost of construction, nuclear energy has the advantage of being one of the most cost-effective energy solutions available. The cost to produce electricity from nuclear energy is much lower than the cost to produce energy from gas, coal, or oil unless those resources are located near the power plant they supply. Nuclear energy also has the added benefit of facing comparatively low risks for cost inflation —unlike traditional fossil fuels that regularly fluctuate in price.\n2. Reliable Source of Energy\nWhile some energy sources are dependent upon weather conditions, like solar and wind power, nuclear energy has no such constraints. It doesn’t matter if the wind isn’t blowing or if the day is cloudy. Nuclear power plants are essentially unaffected by external climatic factors and create predictable and steady energy output. A nuclear power plant in full-swing operation can produce energy non-stop for an entire year, which allows for a good return on investment because there is no delay in energy production.\nNuclear power plants are also reliable because we have enough uranium on the planet to generate energy for the next 70-80 years. While that may not sound like a long time, it is longer than many fossil fuels are estimated to last, and there are other nuclear energy sources being explored to power nuclear power plants.\n3. Stable Base Load Energy\nYou may not realize it, but nuclear energy is widely used in America. In fact, it makes up around 20% of all electricity generated in the United States. This efficient energy source comes from the 98 nuclear power reactors dotted around 30 different states in the U.S. The stable production of power created by nuclear power plants means that it can ideally be used in conjunction with other forms of renewable energy.\nFor example, wind turbines generate significant amounts of power—when the wind blows. When the wind is blowing, nuclear plants can adjust energy output to be lower. Conversely, when the wind is not blowing and greater energy is needed, nuclear energy can be adjusted to compensate for the lack of wind (or solar) generated power.\n4. Produces Low Pollution\nWhen it comes to pollution, it’s clear that there are pros and cons of nuclear energy, and don’t worry, we’ll touch on the issue of nuclear waste in a moment. However, the overall output of pollution from a nuclear power plant is quite low compared with energy production from fossil fuels. The current consumption of nuclear energy already reduces over 555 million metric tons of emissions every year. This reduction in greenhouse gases is a great indicator of how switching to nuclear energy can help reduce our effect on global climate change in the long run.\n5. Sufficient Fuel Availability\nLike fossil fuels, the uranium used to supply nuclear power plants is in limited supply. However, our uranium reserves are estimated to last another 80 years, whereas fossil fuels have a much more limited lifespan. Since the Industrial Revolution, we have been consistently and constantly depleting our fossil fuel reserves. If we continue consuming fossil fuels and keep increasing our consumption as the world population grows, we are estimated to run out of oil by 2052, gas in 2060, and coal by 2088.\nOf course, there are more fossil fuel discoveries we have yet to make, but they are fewer and farther between than ever and will eventually run out. Switching to uranium might give us the extra time we need to find better and cleaner renewable energy resources. Plus, some countries like India, China, and Russia are already working towards using the greener and more abundant thorium to power nuclear reactors. If we switch to thorium we will have even longer than 80 years or fuel available. However, if scientists are able to turn nuclear fusion into a reality, we would theoretically never run out of electricity ever again. Turning nuclear energy into sustainable energy requires the use of breeder reactors and nuclear fusion to sustain us for the foreseeable future.\n6. It Has High Energy Density\nOn our list of the pros and cons of nuclear energy, this pro is quite astounding. Nuclear fission (the process used to generate nuclear energy) releases much greater amounts of energy than simply burning fossil fuels like gas, oil, or coal. How much more efficient? Nuclear fission is nearly 8,000 times more efficient at producing energy than traditional fossil fuels. That’s a considerable amount of energy density. Because nuclear energy is more efficient, it requires less fuel to power the plant and therefore creates less waste as well.\nNuclear Energy Cons\nOn our list of pros and cons of nuclear energy, we’ve covered what makes nuclear power a great option for the future of our electricity needs. However, there are disadvantages of nuclear energy to keep in mind when considering if this power source is the best form of environmentally friendly energy for our future. Here are some of the main cons of nuclear energy.\n1. Expensive to Build\nDespite being relatively inexpensive to operate, nuclear power plants are incredibly expensive to build—and the cost keeps rising. From 2002 to 2008 the estimated cost to build a nuclear plant grew from $2-$4 billion to $9 billion, and power plants often surpass their cost estimates during construction. In addition to the expense of building a power plant, nuclear plants must also allocate funds to protect the waste they produce and keep it in cooled structures with security procedures in place. All of these costs make nuclear power quite expensive.\n2. Accidents\nOne of the first things most people think of when they hear nuclear power plant is the disaster at Chernobyl. Although we don’t know exactly how many people died as a result of the Chernobyl incident, it’s estimated that there have been as many as 10,000 deaths from the long-term effects of radiation in the region. The Fukushima power plant crisis in 2011 showed that no matter how safe nuclear power plants are designed to be, accidents can and do happen.\n3. Produces Radioactive Waste\nAlthough nuclear energy production does not create any emissions, it does produce radioactive waste that must be securely stored so it doesn’t pollute the environment. While radiation might sound scary, we are constantly exposed to small amounts of radioactivity from cosmic rays or radon in the air we breathe. In small quantities, radiation isn’t harmful—but the radioactive waste from nuclear energy production is incredibly dangerous.\nStorage of radioactive waste is a major challenge facing nuclear power plants. Because there’s no way to destroy nuclear waste, the current solution is to seal it securely in containers and store it deep underground where it can’t contaminate the environment. As technology improves, we will hopefully find better ways of storing radioactive waste in the future.\n4. Impact on the Environment\nNuclear power plants have a greater impact on the environment than just the waste they produce. The mining and enrichment of uranium are not environmentally friendly processes. Open-pit mining for uranium is safe for miners but leaves behind radioactive particles, causes erosion, and even pollutes nearby sources of water. Underground mining isn’t much better and exposes miners to high amounts of radiation while producing radioactive waste rock during extraction and processing.\n5. Security Threat\nNuclear power presents a unique threat to our national security because it is powered by nuclear energy. Terrorists might target nuclear power plants with the intention of creating a disaster, and the uranium used to produce the power can be turned into nuclear weapons if they end up in the wrong hands. For these reasons, security surrounding nuclear materials and nuclear power plants is extremely important.\n6. Limited Fuel Supply\nThere might be some important pros and cons of nuclear energy, but one of the most important considerations to keep in mind is that nuclear energy is dependent on uranium and thorium to produce energy. Unless we can find a way to create nuclear fusion or build breeder reactors before our supply dries up, we will be unable to create energy with the nuclear power plants we’ve built for the future. Ultimately, nuclear power is only a temporary solution with a very high price tag.\nA Sustainable Future\nLearning about the pros and cons of nuclear energy will help you make your own decision about whether it’s a good choice for our future energy needs or whether it’s not a long-term strategy worth pursuing.

But while its history is checkered, nuclear energy mostly operates out of sight, generating about 10% of the world’s total electricity and 29% of the world’s low-carbon power.\nNuclear reactors generate energy day and night, and produce no greenhouse gasses. Still, the growth of nuclear is slowing in comparison to other low-carbon sources like wind and solar.\nThat’s because nuclear power plants are expensive to build, construction often takes longer than expected and public opposition is strong.\nFor nuclear power to be effective in the future, one key lies in upgrading technology, designing safer and more efficient fission reactors with the support of philanthropists like Bill Gates.\nGovernment labs, private investors, and intergovernmental organizations are also devoting vast resources to what many consider the holy grail of energy — nuclear fusion. Fusion is the process that powers our sun and every other star in the universe. And if we figure out how to harness that power here on earth, it would be a  game changer.\nThe Exchange WATCH LIVE\nUP NEXT |Power Lunch 02:00 pm ET", "Nuclear Energy: Fission, Fusion and the Future - Infiniti’s NewsletterCommentShareCommentShare\n☰\nMar 10, 2021 12 min read newsletter\nNuclear Energy: Fission, Fusion and the Future\nAbstract: Climate change sounds like an existential crisis over the course of this century. The planet is hurtling towards rising average temperatures and there is increasing demand to shift towards low-carbon energy sources. Nuclear, geothermal and other renewable sources of energy are the way forward.\nIntroduction\nEnergy drives economies and sustains civilizations. Energy powers cellular functions at the microscopic level to the sun that powers life on Earth at the macroscopic level. Early humans discovered fire, a source of energy that they used for warmth, light and cooking food. Cooking food enabled us to take larger calories in a shorter amount of time. More food enabled our brains, energy-intensive machines, to grow larger. This also fundamentally changed how humans spent time and energy. Before cooking, humans spent large portions of the day hunting, foraging and eating. But with fire and cooking, humans started to spend more time thinking, socializing and creating new tools.\n200 years ago, humans discovered fossil fuels that could be used as energy and thus began the industrial revolution. It led to more productive ways of living and enabled progress as we have never seen before. Access to cheap energy at a large scale came as both boon and bane.\nThe boon: A single steam engine powered by coal could do the work of a dozen horses or 5 dozen men in much less time. Rapid progress in low-cost automobiles and widespread use of electricity changed the way society consumes energy. Energy demand started to double every 10 years and then gradually rise at an exponential rate. Our World in data claims \"It(Energy) has allowed work to become more productive, and people in industrialized countries are much richer than their ancestors, work much less, and enjoy much better living conditions than ever before. Energy access is therefore one of the fundamental driving forces of development.\"\nThe bane: Energy from fossil fuels has led to an increase in air pollution, deaths during mining or excavation of resources and greenhouse gases. Energy (electricity, heat and transport) is responsible for 73.2% of GHG emissions.\nGiven that development and improved standards of living are in direct correlation with energy access, the demand for energy will only continue to increase further as we pull more and more people out of poverty. It is clear that there is a demand for a transition to an energy source that is clean and safe across the globe.\n(Even if one were a climate change denier, it is inevitable that there will come a time when non-renewable resources run out, and there will be a need to transition off of fossil fuels long before then, to have a smooth transition and not dampen the economic progress.)\nNuclear, geothermal and other renewable sources of energy are the way forward. While renewable sources are the most sought solution, there are places in the world owing to poor atmospheric or climate conditions that are not suitable for renewable sources of energy. Eg: South East Asia is prone to heavy and variable monsoon that affect prospects of renewable sources of energy. Let's save Geothermal and other renewable sources of energy for another day and dive into nuclear today.\nTechnical Landscape\nOur world in Data claims Nuclear Energy is the safest based on the number of deaths per TWh produced. However, there is more to it. Is the technology safe enough that even if the core explodes, can the knock-off effects be limited?\nBut we need to understand the two kinds of nuclear sources of energy:\nNuclear Fission: The splitting of a large atomic nucleus, such as Uranium or Thorium, into smaller nuclei and releasing energy in the process.\nNulcearFusion: Energy is produced by smashing together light atoms. In other words, the opposite of Fission.\nNuclear energy has been touted as an alternative to fossil fuels. Fission reactors can be expensive, generate large amounts of radioactive waste and come with safety risks. All the fiascos and failures in the past on the nuclear energy front have been caused by nuclear fission reactors. The impact of the Fukushima reactor which led to countries like Germany shutting down their nuclear plants is debatable. Although the reactor is directly accountable for 1 death, subsequent opposition to nuclear energy has caused more damage to the planet.\nNuclear Fusion has more advantages than Nuclear fission in that it is cleaner, cheaper and safer, there has been no technologically viable nuclear fusion reactor that has been built. However, there has been tremendous progress over the last decade in both nuclear fission and nuclear fusion technologies that are commercially as well as technologically viable while being extremely safe. Let’s explore them a little bit.\nNuclear Fission:\nNuclear Fission is taking the heavy elements and splitting them up into lighter elements while creating energy during the process.\nA general overview of a Fission reactor is as follows:\nFissionable isotopes like Uranium 235, 233 or Plutonium 239 absorb a neutron and then split up into fission products. In that process, they release heat as well as eject more neutrons to continue the chain reaction. A moderator is usually employed to slow down the neutrons. The heat released is passed to a working fluid, either gas or water, which then runs a steam turbine to generate electricity. In terms of fuel, there is at least 3 times more thorium than uranium on Earth. And it's waste largely decays in 100s of years rather than 10,000s. There are different designs for a fission reactor:\nMolten Salt Reactor (MSR):\nMSRs operate on the same basic principle as conventional nuclear power reactors — controlled fission to produce steam that powers electricity-generating turbines. The primary fuel is a molten salt mixture - a salt that is solid at standard temperature and pressure but enters the (ionic) liquid phase due to elevated temperature. The liquid salt can be both the fuel that produces heat and the coolant that transports the heat to the power plant.\nCredit: Ensuring Nuclear Performance\nThe salt is heated above the melting point so that it becomes fluid. One of the common designs for a Molten Salt Reactor is to dissolve fissile material in the molten salt. The fuel flows around graphite rods which moderate the energy of the neutrons. Other designs include liquid or solid fuels contained in rods but with molten salt as coolant. There is a broad range of fuel and salt compositions while some designs do not require a moderator at all.\nReplacing water as coolant and operating at atmospheric pressure removes the possibility of explosion risks. In the case of MSR, Nuclear reactions are easier to control because liquid salts expand. In the event of an unexpected rise in temperature, this expansion shuts down the reaction. In the event of failsafe such as power failure, a freeze plug is in place to dump the fuel into tanks and stop the reaction.\nMSRs do not produce dangerous and radioactive fission gases that are under pressure, as they are naturally absorbed into the molten salt. This removes the possibility of contaminating large areas of land and making the process safe.\nSince they operate at a higher temperature compared to conventional reactors, they can generate electricity more efficiently. The use of liquid fuel allows for real-time waste processing. Additionally, the technology allows for new fuel to be introduced during operation removing the need for shutting down the reactor for refuelling.\nThere are two major challenges with MSR\nUnderstanding and mitigating the corrosion of structural materials, and\nDevelopment of reliable and efficient chemical separations\nSeaborg is a Danish startup with 25 Million $ in funding that develops the Compact Molten Salt Reactor based on molten fluoride salt. Flibe Energy is a startup with 4.2 Million $ based in the US that designs liquid-fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR), a molten-salt reactor. Moltex is a UK-Canada stable salt reactor based nuclear fission company that became the first nuclear energy startup to raise funds through crowdfunding.\nTravelling Wave Reactor(TWR):\nTWR is another type of fission process that converts fertile material - material that is not fissile but can be converted to fuel by removing neutron i.e nuclear transmutation - in addition to fissile material such as uranium. TWR is considered efficient because it can use depleted fuel without reprocessing. The technology is claimed to be cheaper, safer and non-proliferating which enables it to be made available to all nations.\nBill Gates-funded Terrapower is developing TWR but seem to be far-fectched from realizing their goal anytime soon.\nSmall Modular Reactors(SMR):\nSMR reactors, as the name describes are smaller than conventional reactors(take up ~1% of the space) and modular in design. The design permits the reactor to generate 50x more power compared to a typical reactor. Each modular reactor is designed with passive safety features to avoid a meltdown while eliminating the use of pumps and pipes that may fail or cause an accident.\nCredit: sciencemag.org\nOklo is an SMR startup with 25 Million $ funding that became the first advanced fission company in the US to have a license application accepted by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. X-Energy is another US startup with 6 Million $ in funding that is designing the safest, most efficient and most advanced small modular reactors.\nFission reactors are expensive to build, although they already account for all the nuclear power supply across the globe. Globally, around 10% of electricity comes from nuclear fission and countries like France(70%) and Sweden(40%) depend already on it.\nFusion Energy:\nNuclear Fusion powers the solar system through the sun. It involves ‘fusing’ two hydrogen atoms that combine to form Helium while releasing energy in the process. It is the fusion of elements that create other elements that make up everything in this universe - from planets to humans. Hydrogen and its isotopes - deuterium and tritium - are virtually free, limitless, and equally distributed around the globe.\nCredits: Auclimate\nWhat startups and labs are trying to recreate is the core of the sun inside a lab. Heat a bunch of hydrogen atoms at 10s of millions of degrees inside an oven-like-setup that is well insulated so that these atoms fuse together to create huge amounts of energy. It is claimed that in such nuclear reactions, the power generated per fuel input is 200 Million times more compared to the same fuel required to burn hydrocarbons. Why is that so?\nThere are two fundamental forces that play a role here:\nStrong nuclear force holds protons and neutrons together inside the nucleus, and\nColoumb force which causes positively charged protons to repel each other\nAnd these forces are opposing in nature. The strong nuclear force is more powerful than Coulomb forces for atoms with small nuclei and the difference in force is released as energy in form of emission of subatomic particles or radiation, sometimes both. For elements bigger than Iron, the fusion of atoms do not produce energy since Coulomb force is stronger due to more number of protons.\nThe forces that dictate nuclear binding are far stronger than forces that hold electrons in orbit around a nucleus( quiet rightly called weak nuclear force). Therefore, chemical reactions that happen when fuels such as hydrocarbons are burnt produce much less energy. This is why fusion fuels offer vastly higher energy density than chemical methods—about a million times denser than fossil fuels.\nWhen confined at these high temperatures, the nuclei can collide with sufficient speed to overcome Coulomb repulsion and fuse together. Besides the temperature, the fusion process should also be maintained at certain pressure and confinement time to create a plasma - a state of matter in which an ionized gaseous substance becomes highly electrically conductive.\nTo attain plasma, an atom is heated to a point(called ionization energy level), at which its electrons get stripped away leaving behind a bare nucleus called an ion. With multiple atoms going through the same process, a hot cloud of ions and electrons are formed and the hot cloud is plasma. Since plasma, or the cloud of ions and electrons, is electrically conductive and magnetically susceptible it is easier to control these particles.\nThere are many methods that are under research to infuse plasma. Some of the most advanced concepts in the making are:\nMagnetic Confinement Fusion:\nRace hot plasma around in a magnetically confined environment with an internal current. Eg: Tokamak uses a torus (donut-shaped) magnetic bottle as the confined environment. Fusion fuel (dueterium and trituium) is heated to form a high-temperature plasma which is then made to fuse by squeezing the plasma.\nCredits: ITER\nCurrently, with an input power of 70 MegaWatts(MW), an output of 500 MW is achieved for a few hundred seconds but the aim is to sustain the fusion reaction for a long period of time. There are lithium blankets placed outside the plasma reaction chamber to absorb the high-energy neutrons released from the fusion reaction that can be used to make more tritium fuel.\nThe blankets also get heated by the neutrons and heat is transferred by a water-cooling loop to make steam that drives electrical turbines to produce electricity.\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems is a young startup, an MIT spin-off, with 200M $ in backing that is developing a revolutionary superconducting magnet technology to accelerate the path to commercial fusion energy. They hope to have a commercial plant ready by 2025.\nTokamak Energy, with a funding of 50 Million $, is a UK startup that aims to deliver clean and abundant fusion power by 2030. The company's chief Scientist Mikhail Gryaznevich is a leading authority in the field of Tokamak designs.\nWhile Tokamaks create magnetic fields using an internal current, Stellarators attempt to create a natural twisted plasma path, using external magnets. Renaissance Fusion, a French startup is the first company to focus on Stellarator technology.\nTAE technologies is the oldest, well established and most funded (600 Million $) in the fusion energy spectrum. Unlike a tokamak, their design generates a magnetic field through eddy currents - current induced within conductors by a changing magnetic field - in the plasma that reverses the axial field.\nInertial Confinement Fusion:\nInitiate nuclear fusion reactions by heating and compressing pellets(~10mg) or fuel targets that usually contains a mixture of deuterium and tritium. Usually, high energy beams of laser or beam of ions are delivered to the outer layer of the target to compress and heat the fuel.\nCredits: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\nAs the heated outer layer explodes, a reaction force accelerates the inner layer inwards compressing the target which creates shockwaves further compressing the target. This heats the fuel at the center creating a fusion reaction. During the final implosion, the fuel core reaches 100 times the density and ignites at 100 Million deg C. Currently, the technology can produce only the same output for a given input of electricity.\nA major challenge with this technology is successfully removing heat from the reaction chamber without interfering with the targets and driver beams.\nFirst Light Fusion and Marvel Fusion are two early-stage European companies that approach ICF with a copper disk at high velocity and laser-based approach, respectively to target pellets.\n3.  Magnetic Target Fusion:\nA hybrid between Magnetic Confinement Fusion and Inertial Confinement Fusion, the system has 3 main components:\na plasma injector, which supplies the fuel i.e converts the hydrogen fuel into a hot plasma and trap it in a magnetic field, ready for compression\nan array of pistons, to compress the fuel. To form a perfectly symmetrical shockwave, these pistons must strike within fractions of a second of each other.\nand a chamber of spinning liquid metal to hold the fuel and capture the energy.\nMaking a plasma that is stable is the biggest challenge with this technology. General Fusion is a Canadian company with 200M $ in funding that is most established in the nuclear energy space. As of 2017, the company claimed to have a prototype ready by 2022.\nThe current challenges with this technology are:\nsuccessful removal of heat from the reaction chamber without interfering with the targets and driver beams.\nthe huge number of neutrons released in the fusion reactions causing the plant to become intensely radioactive as well as mechanically weakening metals.\nConventional metals such as steel used to build fusion plants would have to be replaced frequently owing to their short lifetimes.\nIf these challenges could be overcome, Nuclear energy could become the holy grail of energy that is abundant, clean, safe while enabling progress both economically and technologically. It seems likely that nuclear energy becomes the norm before the end of the next decade and at least one of the above-mentioned startups could lead the charge.\nMarket Landscape\nResources:\nWhat is Nuclear is a great website run by a group of nuclear scientists that explain the concepts behind nuclear energy and share some interesting information.\nIsabelle is a badass social media influencer who shares educational and entertaining content about nuclear energy.\nPublished by:\nCCUS: Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage\nClimateTech: Capitalism, Malthusian Trap and Opportunities\nSpace Manufacturing: Microgravity and Industrializing Space\n10 min read", "Nuclear energy and climate change - World Nuclear Association\nHome / Nuclear and Climate Change Information / How can nuclear combat climate change?\nHow can nuclear combat climate change?\nTo limit the impacts of climate change, the world must rapidly reduce its dependency on fossil fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

{"query_id": "161", "generated_response": "# Understanding the Abortion Debate: Arguments, Influences, and Current Landscape\n\nThe abortion debate remains one of the most divisive issues in society, with deeply held positions on both sides. Here's a comprehensive overview based on current information:\n\n## Main Arguments in the Abortion Debate\n\n### Pro-Life Position\nThe pro-life movement centers on several key arguments [1][2]:\n- **Right to Life**: Supporters argue that a fetus is a human person from conception, making abortion equivalent to murder [1][2][3]\n- **Religious Foundation**: Many cite biblical verses and believe that \"all lives should be saved, no matter what circumstance\" [2]\n- **Value of Human Life**: They argue that human dignity is inherent and not determined by developmental stage or societal value [2]\n\n### Pro-Choice Position\nThe pro-choice movement emphasizes different priorities [1][3]:\n- **Bodily Autonomy**: Women should have the right to \"decide what happens to her own body\" [1][3]\n- **Privacy Rights**: Abortion decisions are considered private medical matters [3]\n- **Practical Circumstances**: Recognition that women may need abortions due to financial hardship, health risks, or other compelling reasons [1]\n\n## Why People Hold Different Views\n\nThe divide often stems from fundamental differences in [2][3]:\n- **When personhood begins**: Whether a fetus is considered a person at conception, viability, or birth\n- **Religious beliefs**: Different faiths have varying teachings about abortion [3]\n- **Philosophical approaches**: Whether morality comes from religious texts, personal conscience, or secular reasoning [2]\n\n## Factors Shaping Abortion Rights\n\n### Legal Evolution\nThe legal landscape has been significantly shaped by court decisions [3]:\n- **Roe v. Wade (1973)**: Established constitutional protection for abortion rights\n- **Ongoing legal challenges**: The Supreme Court continues to hear cases that could modify or overturn Roe [3]\n\n### Political Influence\nPolitical ideologies have deeply influenced abortion policy [3]:\n- Conservative politicians generally support restrictions\n- Liberal politicians typically favor abortion rights\n- State-level variations create a patchwork of different laws\n\n### Religious and Cultural Factors\nWhile the search results don't specifically mention the Rapture, they do show how religious beliefs broadly influence abortion views [2][3]:\n- Different denominations have varying positions on when life begins\n- Religious arguments are frequently cited by pro-life advocates\n- Cultural attitudes toward women's roles also play a part\n\n## Current Abortion Options\n\n### The Abortion Pill (Mifepristone/RU-486)\nThe medication abortion option has become increasingly important [4][5][6][7]:\n\n**How it works**: RU-486 \"blocks the action of the natural hormone progesterone, which is essential to maintain a pregnancy,\" typically followed by misoprostol to stimulate contractions [5]\n\n**Safety and effectiveness**: The medication is \"about 95% effective\" and \"medically safer than Tylenol and Viagra\" according to research [5][7]\n\n**Current access challenges**: \n- 19 states require in-person dispensing, blocking telemedicine options [4][7]\n- Texas has banned medication abortion after 7 weeks and prohibited mail delivery [7]\n- The FDA temporarily lifted restrictions during the pandemic but states can still impose their own limits [4][7]\n\n## Current Priorities of Women's Rights Groups\n\nBased on recent developments, reproductive rights organizations are focusing on [7]:\n\n### Expanding Access\n- **Telemedicine options**: Advocating for remote consultations and mail delivery of abortion pills\n- **Advanced provision**: Providing medication before it's immediately needed as a safeguard against restrictive laws [7]\n\n### Legal Strategy\n- Challenging state restrictions that contradict federal FDA approvals\n- Fighting \"trigger laws\" that automatically restrict abortion access [7]\n\n### Support Networks\nOrganizations like the Lilith Fund and National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice are prioritizing support for marginalized communities, as \"these laws always impact Black, Indigenous, and other people of color the most\" [7]\n\n### Education and Awareness\nGroups like Shout Your Abortion are \"rais[ing] awareness about the abortion pill and helping people acquire the medication who cannot access local abortion services\" [7]\n\n## The Ongoing Tension\n\nThe debate continues to evolve with new medical technologies and changing political landscapes. As one activist noted, \"It's never been more clear that anti-abortion laws are designed to stop access to abortion care and have never been about safety\" [7], while pro-life advocates maintain their focus on protecting what they view as human life from conception.\n\nThis multifaceted issue involves deeply personal beliefs about life, autonomy, religion, and government's role in private decisions, which explains why it remains such a persistent and passionate debate in American society.", "citations": ["https://enelson151.blogspot.com/", "https://www.biblequery.org/Practice/Abortion/Abortion.html", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_debate\n", "https://www.tpr.org/podcast/the-source/2021-07-11/abortion-pill", "https://www.healthcentral.com/condition/ru-486", "https://www.webmd.com/women/news/20000928/brief-history-of-abortion-pill-in-us", "https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/12/11/2068616/-Doctors-and-activists-call-for-advance-provision-of-the-abortion-pill?detail=emaildkre2"], "contexts": ["English 151 Blog\nEnglish 151 Blog\nMonday, November 7, 2011\nEmily Nelson\nProfessor Lutz\nEnglish 151\nNovember 3 2011\nAbortion: The Arguments in Today's Society\nAbortion is one of the most highly debated topics among the world to this day. There are many different views and opinions that surround this topic that make the situation all that more complicated. The sides of the argument include Pro-Choice and Pro-Life and it is one of the only disputes that effects people morally, socially and medically. Pro-Choice refers to those who support women’s rights to abort a fetus. Pro- Life activists believe abortion should be made illegal and believe it is murder. When a woman is given the option to abort, immediately there is a lot of emotion and pressure surrounding the decision to be made. Depending on the circumstance, a woman’s right to abort a fetus is crucial, always controversial, but ultimately it is a very strong decision from all angles. Pro-Life activists have valid arguments and support the right to life, but there are times where abortion is done in an understandable situation. Abortions are part of a woman’s right to choose and the law protects that right. Overall, I believe abortions can be done for the right reasons and they are going to be needed in various circumstances, I support a woman’s right to choose.\nWHO HAS ABORTIONS\nhttp://realweb.ifastnet.com/images/reas_stats.gif\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute , the number of abortions have been on the decline since the 1980s. 61.8% of abortions happen in 9 weeks or less into the pregnancy, it is healthiest for a woman to get an abortion done early and an easier procedure for doctors to complete. Of the women who are getting abortions, over half of them are under the age of 20. According to the picture to the right, majority of abortions happen because of financial issues, women aren’t ready for a child, there are problems with the father, and a few other reasons as well. Although there is the option of adoption after the child is born, would you really want an unstable mother to carry a fetus for nine months in her womb and expect her to raise it to be healthy? I understand why Pro-Life activists want to preserve the fetus and give it a good life if a mother is unable to, but Pro-Life activists ignore the other factors such as a woman’s feelings about the situations. Teen mom’s sometimes can’t emotionally handle the effects of having or carrying a child. Their bodies haven’t planned for it and it is physically demanding and changes their childhood forever. The mother’s life is equally important as the fetus' and both parties are accounted for in the abortion decision.\nThe Guttmacher Institute provides accurate and current statistics about abortion. People who get abortions come from many different ages, races, religions and locations. Their website, link previously listed, contains a video that summarizes who, what, where, when and why about terminating pregnancies. Along with the video and statistics, Guttmacher also provides abortion services and explains the laws surrounding the process.\nThe main argument made by pro-choice supporters is for choices to remain an open option for any individual, there should not be a law against deciding if having a child would be a good option for the carrier or for the unborn. By the Free Dictionary definition, pro choice is described as “favoring or supporting the legal right of women and girls to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy to term,” (Free Dictionary ). Free Dictionary also describes pro-choice as a woman’s right to control her own body.\nSupporters of Pro-Life beliefs use The Bible and government policy to support their anti-abortion opinions. They believe that all lives should be saved, no matter what circumstance, no matter how long the fetus has been in the womb. According to the pro-life side of the argument, once a woman has conception of the fetus, it is a living person and abortion is murder. About every anti-abortion support group will tell you that terminating a pregnancy is the same thing as voluntarily killing an innocent human being. In my research I came across a website that supported life starting the second of conception. Many people contribute to the question of why pro-life? At this website readers will find personal stories of how the pro-life movement has affected them.\nWhen a fetus isn’t recognized as entering person hood, abortion is not able to be judged by the government as murder. Recently the government has put many restrictions on abortion rights. According to the article The Case for Pro-Choice Participation in Drafting Fetal Homicide Laws, by Mary Beth Hickcox-Howard, fetal homicide laws are putting a lot of restrictions on women who want to abort. The article states, \"the only acceptable response to a proposed fetal homicide law is to attempt to block its passage entirely and substitute a bill that enhances punishments for assaulting a pregnant woman, but does not create a separate criminal offense for harming of killing the fetus,” (Hickcox-Howard 319). This is an example of fetal homicide laws in action. If the government can’t make a firm distinction between attacking a pregnant woman as one person or attacking a pregnant woman as two people (the fetus being the second person), we can tell that pro-life arguments aren’t strong enough to be put into action. A blog found about Religion and Pro-Life Issues explains why pro-life activists believe a woman is guilty of murder when she is choosing to have an abortion and how it questions that woman's morality. The blog uses God in the argument and explains how the bibles says you should not kill people. A blog by Frank Pavone, Priests for Life , uses different verses in the Bible to prove many reasons for anti-abortion. Each post uses a different excerpt from the Bible and brings it back to why they feel abortion is morally wrong. Pro-Choice activists do not like when new laws are passed, it creates more work for them to prove their stance. Not to say that pro-life supporters don’t have valid arguments but the fact of the matter is, the government has yet to distinguish a fetus as a human. The new laws put restrictions on abortions and make it more difficult for a woman in need to get the surgery. Each side of the abortion debate have very strong points to be made, but when looking at the facts, abortion has yet to be outlawed and women have yet to stop needing the medical procedure.\nWhile researching the topic of abortion, a lot of results came up as personal stories and experiences. Many pro-choice activists post about positive abortion experiences, Kimberly Blessing goes into detail about the reasons of why she is pro-choice. Many of her points can resonate with many people across the United States. Blessings makes the statement, “I’m pro-choice because I know the panic a woman can suffer when she thinks she’s pregnant,” (Blessings ). The topic of abortion is black and white for pro-life supporters. If a woman is pregnant, they should have the baby, but the feeling Blessings describes is common amongst countless women everywhere, we see it in everyday life, movies, TV shows and books. Maybe there was a misuse or no use of contraceptives or maybe there was an incident of rape, sometimes women feel like their life is over when they have an unplanned pregnancy. Women must know if they will be able to take care of this baby and possibly need to decide if they would be able to handle giving it up for adoption. On the pro-life side of the argument, they understand that some women are not ready to bring a child into the world, keeping that in mind, this group also provides support to help the mother raise the child or they help them with the adoption process. The article Re ligion and Politics: USA, by Lisa Sowle Cahill acknowledges the fact that women who want to abort should realize there is help for them and they don’t have abort their pregnancy, \"t he Pregnant Woman Support Act proposes to reduce abortions by promoting pregnancy assistance, adoption, and education and support for new mothers,” (Cahill 189). This shows how even with alternative options to abortion some women still need them.\nBlessing’s blog is very personal, her writing is very informal and appeals to many readers. After reading what she had to say it made me realize how pro-life supporters in the government are trying to get these laws passed that are ultimately stripping women’s right to choose away from them. Another point made in this blog that really opened my eyes was “I’m pro-choice because there are already too many unwanted and uncared-for children in this world, and I believe to bring another unwanted one in is cruel to that child,” (Blessings). The main belief of pro-life supporters is a mother should take care of the child until it is able to live outside of the womb, they do not necessarily have to raise the baby but having the baby is the purpose of anti-abortion activists. Forcing a woman to go through with an unwanted pregnancy that results in an unwanted baby is an act of disrespect to those women and their child-to-be. When a woman is choosing to terminate her pregnancy, she is doing it to take care of something that would not result in a good situation for anybody. More personal abortions stories can be found at Our Bodies Ourselves.\nhttp://liberatethemedia.com/images/Pro-Choice-Design-for-Web.jpg\nSETTLING THE ARGUMENT\nPro-Life supporters are accused of not giving enough support to pregnant women and pro-choice supporters are accused of being murderers. As of now, there is no settlement on the debate of abortion. Many states have lowered the amount of money they give to abortions and require much more legal processing before a woman can actually get an abortion. The numbers of abortions have been on the decline since the 1980s but they still occur fairly often. Approximately 3,700 abortions occur daily in the United States. Unintended pregnancies continue to be an issue in America and abortion will continue to be debated. I believe that a woman should never be constricted to her choices dealing with her body. There are plenty of options for women to consider when entering pregnancy, and abortion should remain to be one of them.\nCahill, Lisa Sowle. \"RELIGION AND POLITICS: U.S.A.\" Theological Studies 70.1 (2009): 186-91.\nPrint.\nHickcox-Howard, Mary Beth. \"THE CASE FOR PRO-CHOICE PARTICIPATION IN DRAFTING\nFETAL HOMICIDE LAWS.\" Texas Journal of Women & the Law 17.2 (2008): 317-41.

They must look at the facts and are faced with a very hard decision, women must ask themselves “will I be able to take care of this baby” and/or “will I be able to give this child up after birth”. If a woman has an unexpected pregnancy after rape, it is emotionally stressful deciding what to do with the fetus. This is a situation where pro-choice support groups gain a lot of respect on their stance. How can a woman be expected to care for a child that would be a constant reminder of being raped?\nPRO-LIFE\nSupporters of Pro-Life beliefs use The Bible and government policy to support their anti-abortion opinions.

I find this topic very interesting because there are so many different ways to look at ‘what is right’ and how people think this type of situation should be handled. I have found four different blogs that will help me further my understanding on the topic of abortion.\nMy first blog is called “Pro-Choice Blog Archive” by Kimberly Blessing. Blessing is firmly pro-choice and through out her blog she is very blunt about her reasoning. She bullet points all of her reasons for being pro-choice and then uses other articles to help support her opinions. This article appeals to me because regardless how anyone feels about the situation, you can relate to at least one of her opinions. Blessing uses strong logos because her persuasion is brought about very logically, “I’m pro-choice because there are already too many unwanted and uncared-for children in this world, and I believe to bring another unwanted one in is cruel to that child,” (Blessing). This article is different than others because it is solely one person’s opinion, but uses credible sources to back her up, unlike other blogs that are a mixture of many people combining into one opinion.\nThe second blog I chose was “Pro-Life Blog” by Bill Beckman. This blog is a collection of many different court issues on getting rid of abortion. It is a lot of news stories combined into one blog maintained by Beckman. I think overall this blog uses logos as well because logos appeals to reason and thinking logically. These articles aren’t opinion based, they are what is actually happening in our society. This blog is unique because it ties many different news sources into one collective blog all relating pro-life thought processes.\nFor my third blog, I chose to look at another pro-life blog by Frank Pavone. Pavone is an American Catholic priest who is a pro-life activist. His blog uses the catholic bible to prove abortion wrong. Depending on ones religious standpoint, this blog could easily be an example of pathos. Religion is typically a strong reason why people are pro-life and if you’re undecided on your opinion, using the bible to appeal to ones emotions could easily sway them pro-life. This is another unique blog mainly because it is 100 percent religion based.\nFor my final blog I found another pro-choice article, “Blog for Choice” is written by many contributors and is a community blog for pro-choice America. It someone reminded me of “Pro-Life Blog” that I previously used because the most recent update is a news article on how representatives voted on a recent abortion issue. This article is much like “Pro-Life Blog” in the sense that they both use news articles and court cases as sources to their pro-choice and pro-life arguments. I believe this a good example of logos for the same reasons previously stated. Both of these blogs use good reasoning to support their points and I think it is interesting to read all the different ways our country is handling this very controversial issue.\n1. http://www.kimberlyblessing.com/archive/category/prochoice\n2. http://www.illinoisrighttolife.org/blog.htm\n3. http://www.priestsforlife.org/blog/index.php/life-is-of-inestimable-value\n4. http://www.blogforchoice.com/archives/2011/10/how-did-your-re.html\nPosted by Emily at 7:15 AM\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\nSunday, October 16, 2011\nEmily Nelson blog 14\nMeg Hourihan’s excerpt on blogging in Everything’s a Text by Dan Melzer and Deborah Coxwell-Teague helped me make a lot of connections with our class blogs to the original purpose of blogging in the first place. Hourihan’s piece showed a lot about how blogs have evolved and what they are now, “Blog posts are short, informal, and sometimes controversial, and sometimes deeply personal, no matter what topic they approach,” (Melzer & Coxwell-Teague 295). I found this information eye catching just because I found it so true. My blogs are always pretty informal, they get to the point and I sometimes connect them with my own personal experiences. They aren’t always strictly structured which makes them a great interactive tool between classmates.\nHourihan made very interesting statements on the evolution and the continuation of the evolution of internet communication and blogging. “What’s important is that we’ve embraced a medium free of the physical limitations of pages, intrusions of editors, and delays of tedious publishing systems,” (Melzer, & Coxwell-Teague 297). It is very clear in this current day in age that everything around us changing at a mile a minute. Everyone is looking for the newest technology that make means of living easier on them. Here we can see how evolution of communication has allowed people to easily share and access their own knowledge and interact with others. Blogging has allowed people to escape the norms of formal publications and lets bloggers express themselves on an array of topics on their own blogs and give feedback on other blogs that appeal to them. There are no longer worries of publication rules when one only wishes to use blogging as their means of communication. Blogging can be used for many different internet interactions and I support Meg Hourihan’s ideas and thoughts on the changing of blogging communication.\nPosted by Emily at 9:42 PM\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\nWednesday, October 12, 2011\nEmily Nelson blog 13\nAs I was reading English Mercury Reader I read a lot of facts about exploratory essays that I forgot to include in my final essay. The first hot spot I noticed in chapter five was, “Along the way you can make your narrative more colorful and grounded by including your strategies for tracking down sources, your conversations with friends, your late-night trips to a coffee shop, and so forth,” (Ramage, Bean & Johnson 113). I agree with this statement, I wish I would have used more personal experiences and more background information at how I arrived at a point. It would have made the essay overall more interesting.\nThe next hot spot I found in chapter five was something I found very helpful wehn researching for my own essay, “By providing overview information about potential sources, they help new researchers determine whether a particular source might be useful for their own purposes,” (Ramage, Bean & Johnson 117). This quote is referring to annotated bibliographies and how they are helpful to new researchers. It’s easy to access informative articles by reading what they are about before reading the whole article.\nWhen I moved on to reading chapter nine, I found two more hot spots. The first one refers to something I didn’t do too well on in my essay, “Once you have cited an author and it is clear that the same author’s material is being used, you need cite only the page numbers in parentheses in subsequent citations,” (Ramage, Bean & Johnson 223). I don’t think I followed that rule for my whole essay and I definitely need to tighten up my citation rules in the next essay I write.\nMy second hot spot for chapter five I found interesting was if you are citing a magazine or newspaper without an author mentioned, Ramage, Bean and Johnson state, “If no author is identified, begin the entry with the title or headline,” (226). I didn’t know you could make a citation without and author accessible, good to know for future references.\nPosted by Emily at 7:28 AM\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\nTuesday, October 4, 2011\nEmily Nelson Blog 11\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzZyUaQvpdc\nWatch this, you'll understand why I think it is a good piece of rhetoric.

According to an article in Forbes Magazine, February 13, 2006, p.76, 24% of U.S. pregnancies end in abortion, and 70% of Russian pregnancies do. (Michael Freedman \"Family Planning : Fertile Ground\")\nFirst recognize that many people do not care what the Bible says about abortion. They do not care what is right or wrong. They only want what they want. But this is written for those who want to know God's will.\nThere are two abortion perspectives: private and public. What do you think about a politician's statement, \"I would never have an abortion... but I wouldn't stop anyone else.\"? What if it was murder?\nWhat about freedom?  My freedom to swing my arm ends where your nose begins. If 1) a fetus is a human life, and 2) mothers must care for unborn babies, then a child's right to live supersedes a mother's freedom to choose to kill. If 1) or 2) is false, then maybe it is OK to kill a fetus like some people kill dolphins.\nYou often can read into the Bible what you like (isogesis) or take seriously what God says and likes (exegesis). Study Exodus 21:22-25 carefully.\nPro-Life Positions\n1. Regular people (not some criminals) have the right to live.\n2. The fetus is a distinct human from the moment of conception.\n3a/3b. Unless the woman's life is endanger, a woman (in all cases / except for rape and incest) have the duty not to kill their unborn babies.\n4. Murder (by abortion or any other name) should be illegal in a moral society.\nPro-Choice Positions\n1. Regular people (not some criminals) have rights to their bodies, as long as they do not hurt others.\n2a/2b. The fetus is not a \"human\" until it (is / is almost) born.\n3. Women do not have the duty be pregnant against their will, and they can change their minds.\n4. Therefore women have the right to choose to end their pregnancy.\nPro-Life Views And Pro-Choice Rebuttals\nWhat value do you place on human life after a child is born?\nThere are three categories of pro-life arguments.\nThe italicized words are pro-choice rebuttals.\nAnti-Birth Control Arguments\nTwo anti-abortion arguments can also be used to \"prove\" we must have as many children as possible. If that is wrong then these are too.\nPsalm 127:3-5 shows the value God places, and we should also place, on kids. How can someone believe this verse and allow abortions?\nAbortion snuffs out the potential in a child. One never knows what a child could do for society.\nAnti-Mid and Late Term Arguments\nI have never met a 100% pro-choice person. Few would justify taking an infant out minutes before birth and killing it. Today doctors sometimes induce labor early, so you cannot draw the line at birth.\nIn Luke 1:41-44 John the Baptist leapt for joy in Elizabeth's womb. Thus he was a person who had emotions and a spirit. The Spirit's filling before birth of this unique person is not the norm.\nLike John the Baptist, unborn babies have emotions too. The film Silent Scream shows that mid-term aborted babies fight to the death the suction tube for the convenience of the mother.\nSee also Psalm 139:13-16 Isaiah 49:1, Jeremiah 1:5, and Judges 13:3-7. Job 3:3 and Gen 4:1 emphasize birth.\nAbortion stops a beating heart; abortion makes brain waves go dead. Abortion kills.\nValue Pro-Life Arguments\nThere are more fundamental reasons to be pro-life. The worth of a person is not determined by his value to society or parents' views. All humans have this dignity given by God, though men try to deny it.\nMaking a baby is a continuous process; we cannot draw a line. As we declare some of the human species \"non-people\", we do inhuman things. Today doctors even experiment with aborted babies. When aborted babies come out alive, doctors have killed them.\nIf abortion is permitted to continue, the evil is done not only to the babies but to ourselves. As we turn ourselves into monsters, the Canaanites of old live again.\nPro-choice Views and Pro-Life Rebuttals\nThere are two categories of pro-choice arguments. The italicized words are pro-life rebuttals.\nPro-Infanticide Arguments\nMost (but not all) arguments for abortion can be used equally well to justify killing babies one day before birth. We can call these \"Canaanite arguments.\"\nFetal experiments and tissue may help treat people. If infants also helped, would killing babies be OK?\nThe Bible never specifically prohibits abortion. The Bible never explicitly prohibits chainsaw massacres of babies either. If unborn babies are people, then the sixth commandment covers abortion too.\nWe should not make secular laws about things in a religious book.\nTheft, rape, and murder are in the Bible too, but that does not mean we cannot make laws about those. Even many atheists can agree the theft, rape, and murder are wrong.\nN.A.R.A.L. (National Abortion Rights Action League) estimated that prior to Roe vs. Wade there were 5,000 to 10,000 deaths per year. Legalization moved abortions from \"back-street butchers\" to licenses physicians.\nAccording to former abortion doctor Bernard Nathanson, he knew that these figures were a lie. In 1971 the U.S. Bureau of Vital Statistics reported only 39 women died from abortions, not thousands.\nSecond, 84-87% of illegal abortions were performed by licensed physicans according to Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey in the Americal Journal of Public Health.\nThird, the argument assumes that unborn babies are not people. Everyone should agree that economics and convenience would not justify killing babies.\nIf abortion were illegal, many women would do it anyway.\nSome people still kill infants though it is illegal. For this reason should we make infant killing legal too?\nIf abortion were illegal, rich women would still have it done in other countries, and it would be unfair to poor women.\nFirst many women would not have it if it were deemed illegal. More importantly, if killing a baby were legal by traveling to another country, or for a price, would this justify giving everyone the right to kill their babies in our country?\nHaving the baby can be an economic hardship.\nRaising a baby can be also, but that does not justify killing it. Furthermore, there is a shortage of healthy babies to adopt in the United States.\nAbortion should be justified if the baby would be known to be physically or mentally handicapped (or some would say the wrong sex).\nWould killing a child be justified if the child became physically or mentally handicapped? Suicide rates of handicapped people are lower than healthy people, and most of them are glad that they are alive.\nMany fetuses naturally die before birth.\nMany babies naturally die after birth too, but does that justify actively killing a baby?\nWhy should men decide what women can do with their bodies?\nKilling a baby both after and before a natural delivery is wrong (or right) regardless of the sex of a person talking about it. But if is not just an excuse but a real objection, it was nine men who legalized abortion. There are plenty of women who are pro-life. Finally, many abortionists argue assuming what they are trying to prove, that unborn babies are not humans. But if you assume the opposite, then over 1 million people in America today die from abortions every year, and almost 50% of them are males.\nIsa 43:1-7, Rev 3:5 and Lk 10:20 say that God calls believers by name. Before we have a name then (at birth) perhaps then we are not people. Some cultures do not name infants until well after they are born. Is it ok for them to kill unnamed infants?\nPro-life people think pregnant women should have less freedom than other people. Due to their chosen responsibilities, mothers and fathers have less freedom too.\nIn Gen 2:7 God breathed into Adam the breath of life. So we are people when we first breathe. This was only for the first man.\nMany verses (Isa 49:5, Ps 22:9-10 58:3 71:6) teach that God cares for us since birth. Ps 22:9-10 says from the womb (before birth).\nPro-Early Term Arguments\nThe strongest arguments only justify early term abortions.\nSince many are not sure when human personhood begins, it is questionable that killing an early term fetus is murder.\nIf one were paid to demolish a building, it is be morally justified to do so if there were a 50% chance a child might still be inside it? A 10% chance? A 5% chance?\nThe 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision said a state could not prohibit abortion in the first six months, or even after that if it would impair the mother's physical or mental health.\nHowever, physical and mental health were so broadly defined in the subsequent Doe vs. Bolton (1973) decision, that former Chief Justice Warren Burger (who voted for the majority in Roe vs. Wade) admitted that we have abortion available on demand (Thornburg vs. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (1986).\nAt one time the early Egyptians' penalty for adultery was death. If the woman got pregnant they first waited for the child to be born. In the Old Testament adulterous women were executed with their unborn babies, so this was all OK. Even this argument does nothing to justify late-term abortions. While this may appear to justify early term abortion or \"morning-after\" pills, executions in general are not murder in the Old Testament.\nSince a creature's life is in the blood (Gen 9:4 Lev 17:11,14 Deut 12:23), and blood cells form 20 days after conception, before then abortion may be OK.\n1 Cor 15:46 says, \"However, the spiritual is not first but the natural; then the spiritual.\" This refers to salvation, not gestation. Non-Christians are not non-humans!\nIn 1980 only 113,500 out of 1.5 million abortions (9%) were in the 4th through 9th months. Since neurological structures are not developed until 13 1/2 weeks (over 3 months) more than 91% were before the fetus could feel pain. First the nerves are partially developed starting at 2 months, brain waves at 2 1/2 months, and 480,000 abortions (33%) of all abortions in 1980 were between the 8th and 13th week. Second, even if personhood were defined by some as feeling pain, 9% to 42% is too many painful deaths. They have seen the baby's grimace as it is getting dismembered, and how the baby moves to try to avoid the deadly tube suctioning up it body parts piece by piece.\nWithdrawing the support a fetus requires is not murder. Abortion is often painful killing by salt poisoning, vacuum, or by knife. At only 13 1/2 weeks unborn babies show aversive response to needles, and grimace when deadly salt solution is injected.\nBefore abortion was legalized, desperate woman died after giving themselves abortions with coat-hangers. There are more deaths today from the many women seeking abortions than there were before abortion was legalized.\nValue Pro-Choice Arguments\nConsider the situation in old times where the doctor had to choose between saving the mother and saving the infant. For anyone who believes either that the mother should be saved first or that the mother should choose, they have to admit they place a relative value on human life at least some of the time. Otherwise they would just flip a coin. If a slightly lesser value can be placed on an infant, then certainly a much less value can be placed on cells with no blood, heart, or brain.\nGod left it up to us whether we want to hear what suits our desires (2 Tim 4:3) or to seek out what pleases the Lord (Eph 5:10).\nEcclesiastes 11:5 shows that we do not know how the body is formed in the mother's womb. So it is presumptuous to think life begins at conception. It is presumptuous to think life does not begin at conception. Some pro-abortionists even will not call a fetus a human. If it is not a human, what is it, a cat?\nPs 139:16 all the days written ...\nPs 139:13,16 if being weaved then not human yet\nPs 51:5 \"Behold I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me.\"\nPro-choice: before David was brought forth he was not.\nPro-life: in sin my mother conceived me.\nAbortion Statistics\nYear\nU.S. Abortions (per AGI)\nU.S. Abortions (per CDC)\n% White / Black / Other\n% Suction / Sharp\n1972\n-\n587 K\n77 / 23 / 0\n65 / 23\n1976\n1,179 K\n988 K\n67 / 33 / 0\n83 / 10\n1980\n1,553 K\n1,297 K\n70 / 30 / 0\n90 / 6\n1985\n1,589 K\n1,329 K\n67 / 30 / 4\n95 / 3\n1990\n1,608 K\n1,430 K\n65 / 32 / 3\n96 / 3\n1991\n1,557 K\n1,389 K\n64 / 33 / 4\n97 / 2\n1992\n1,529 K\n1,359 K\n62 / 34 / 5\n97 / 2\n1993\n1,495 K\n1,330 K\n61 / 35 / 4\n96 / 3\n1994\n1,423 K\n1,267 K\n61 / 35 / 5\n97 / 3\n1995\n1,359 K\n1,211 K\n60 / 35 / 6\n97 / 2\n1996\n1,360 K\n1,226 K\n1997\n1,335 K\n1,186 K\n1998\n1,319 K\n884 K*\n1999\n1,314 K\n862 K*\n2000\n1,312 K\n857 K*\n2001\n1,291 K\n853 K*\n2002\n1,269 K\n854 K*\n2003\n1,250 K\n848 K*\n2004\n1,222 K\n839 K*\n2005\n1,206 K\n2006\n1,206 K\n2007\n1,206 K\nSource for the first column and last part of the second: http://www.nrlc.org/ABORTION/facts/abortionstats.html: Alan Guttmacher Institute (a pro-choice organization)\nSource: for the last three columns: www.abortionfacts.com/statistics/us_stats_abortion.asp (last updated 2 Nov 2006)\nAbortions per gestation week\nWeek\n% in 1994\n% in 1995\n<= 6 weeks\n16 %\n16 %\n7 weeks\n17 %\n17 %\n8 weeks\n21 %\n21 %\n> 8 weeks\n46 %\n47 %\nSource: www.abortionfacts.com/statistics/us_stats_8_gestation.asp\nWorld wide in 1987 an estimated 22 million reported abortions, and 14 to 31 million estimated unreported ones for a total of 36-53 million total.

Maybe you have not done scholarly research on all the ins and outs of all the arguments, but using what is in this video, you can easily answer most of them anyway. Before we jump to how you can easily answer most arguments, let's first take a sidetrack and understand the types of pro-choice people.\nMorally, people can be classified into three broad categories.\n\"By the end of the second trimester the 'brain's neural circuits are as advance as a newborn's.' Begley, Do You Hear? p.14 (Why Pro-Life? P.50)\n\"Of course, an infant is not fully human.... I have little sympathy with the idea that infanticide is just another form of murder. Persons who are already functionally persons in the full sense have more important rights even than infants.\" Dr. Charles Hartshorne Univ. of Texas \"Concerning Abortion: An Attempt at a Rational View\" The Christian Century 21 January 1981, 42-45.\nSusan B. Anthony, champion of women's suffrage (voting rights) wrote, \"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder.... No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed.\" The Revolution, July 8, 1869 p.4\nIt was not until the 1970's that feminists embraced abortion.\nOutside of America, the vast majority of abortions are of girls. Who Pro-Life? p.59\nAmoral: Their personal happiness/goals are the primary good. They really do not care if something is moral or not. A few might even argue that it is \"species-ism\" to think that a roach should have fewer right than a person, (especially of certain ethnic groups). If they can make lots of money aborting babies, then fine. If they could make lots of money killing infants and adults that would be equally fine. Their conscience is dead, as though seared with a hot iron.\nYou might be thinking it fortunate that there are few people like this, but you would be wrong. Hitler did not personally kill 6 million Jews, 10's of thousands of Nazis did. Mao and his wife did not personally kill 10 million Chinese, a vast number of people were involved. The Khmer Rouge, Idi Amin's soldiers, etc. did not have sophisticated moral arguments trying to justify what they did; they probably viewed not just moral arguments, but morals in general as just a waste of time.\nMany, though not all, atheists can fit comfortably in this group. If morality is just an evolutionary mechanism, why would you do what is right, if it did not benefit you and nobody was looking. When people are looking, they might still support a moral cause, for the good of society, sort of like giving a couple of dollars to your high school team's booster club.\nBy the book: On the other end are people who ground their morality in one or more books. This includes Bible-believing Christians, such as ourselves, as well as conservative Jewish people, Confucianists, Theravada Buddhists, and conservative Muslims. All books are not the same though. A Jew or Christian could logically look at the Bible and conclude that rape is always wrong, but a Muslim looking at the Qur'an and hadiths could conclude that forced sex with captives and slave girls they were not married to was OK. See www.MuslimHope.com/WomenInIslam.html for ample documentation of that.\nIf it feels right: But don't be mistaken in thinking that these are the only two categories. There is a third category of people who have an operating conscience, genuinely want to do what is right (at least some of the time), but believe a relative \"rightness\" can be arrived at without moral absolutes. Some of these know they do not have a consistent moral basis, or perhaps have even given up hope of having a consistent moral basis. Others try to develop a consistent morality, but they have no ground on which to base their morality. A poll a few years ago found that 26% of Americans were strongly pro-choice, 29% were strongly pro-life, and the other 45% were not strongly either one. (Why Pro-Choice? p.16) This middle ground includes many people from all three groups.\nTotal pro-life or total pro-choice are not the only views though. Many people can be thought of as partially pro-life and partially pro-choice. They believe in pro-life after a certain point, except perhaps in the case of rape or incest.\nThere is overlap between the categories. Even people who are amoral on many things might draw the line at some things. For example, amoral people might think ripping the limbs off of adults or children they can see is repulsive, but ripping the limbs off of unborn babies to kill them, with no anesthetic is fine.\nEven people who go by a book will rely on inductive reasoning to generalize and deductive reasoning to apply the clearer things their book says to situations not explicitly mentioned in the book. Christians call this applying scripture, and Muslims have schools of ijtihad.\nWhen Christians discuss abortion with non-Christians, they are venturing off of the solid ground of moral absolutes to the swamp of morality based on feelings and conscience. While it is perfectly fine (and honest) to say you believe pro-life based on the precepts taught Exodus 21:22-23; Psalm 139:15-16; Luke 1:44, etc.) you have to recognize that this argument might not carry much weight for an atheist, Hindu, Buddhist, or someone of another faith.\nSo we can show why their arguments are generally inconsistent with their own morality, and why a pro-life position is the only consistent position, even without scriptural grounding. Ultimately though, we cannot help them find any good, absolute basis for write and wrong, except for God's word.\nAlmost all pro-abortion arguments can be put in four categories:\nIt's not a human arguments\nPro-infanticide arguments\n\"Drawing the line\" arguments\nResponsibility of the mother arguments\nWe discussed these in detail in the \"Answering Abortion Arguments\" video, but here is a brief recap.\nIt's not a human: This is the silliest argument. The DNA is not cat or dog, it is human. Its not just human like an arm or leg is human, but a human being, with only half the genetic code of its mother. It is not just a part of the mother, unless the mother can be said to have four arms, four legs, two sets of genitals, and two brains and two faces. Speaking of faces and brains, the fetus' face, not the mother, is contorted in agony when saline solution puts it in death agony, and the fetus' brain, not the mother's brain is crunched by forceps. If a 100% Swahili embryo is implanted in a Portuguese woman, the baby born is 0% Portuguese and 100% Swahili. Even a test tube baby is 0% \"testtube-ish\".\nPro-Infanticide: Probably most pro-abortion arguments (what if the child is not desired, the baby is not self-sufficient, etc.) applied to babies before they are born, could equally be applied to infants after they are born. If a mother does not have the right to kill her child 5 minutes after a natural birth, why should it not be equally wrong to kill the child 5 minutes before a natural birth. If not having an abortion and giving up the child for adoption causes some economic hardship, that is much less than raising a child after it is born. Etc.\nDrawing the line: Here are various lines:\nBreathing air: Labor can be induced prematurely and a healthy baby born\nViability: Used in the Roe v. Wade case, viability has been pushed back.\nFeeling pain: This is not known for sure, but somewhere between the 20th and 42nd day.\nThere are only four real differences between an infant and a fetus, which others have abbreviated as SLED. S ize, L evel of development, E nvironment, and D egree of Dependency.\nEven a 42-day old fetus has not only a brain and nervous system, capable of feeling pain, but everything else as well. Most people feel it is morally wrong to rip off the limbs of living puppies and kittens, with no anesthetic. Even if someone thought a fetus of X weeks was not human, should not the fetus at least have anesthetic, or the same dignity as a puppy or kitten?\nMother's Responsibility: Mother's have the responsibility to not destroy the human being naturally developing in her.

Morrison, PhD.", "Abortion debate - Wikipedia\nAbortion debate\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nThe abortion debate is the ongoing controversy surrounding the moral, legal, and religious status of induced abortion.[1] In English-speaking countries, the sides involved in the debate are the self-described \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life\" movements. Pro-choice emphasizes the woman's choice whether to terminate a pregnancy.  On the contrary, the pro-life position stresses the humanity of both the mother and fetus, arguing that a fetus is a human person deserving of legal protection. Both terms are considered loaded in mainstream media, where terms such as \"abortion rights\" or \"anti-abortion\" are generally preferred. [2] Each movement has, with varying results, sought to influence public opinion and to attain legal support for its position.\nMany people believe that abortion is essentially a moral issue, concerning the beginning of human personhood, rights of the fetus, and bodily integrity. The debate has become a political and legal issue in some countries with anti-abortion campaigners seeking to enact, maintain and expand anti-abortion laws, while abortion-rights campaigners seek to repeal or ease such laws while expanding access to abortion. Abortion laws vary considerably between jurisdictions, ranging from outright prohibition of the procedure to public funding of abortion. The availability of safe abortion also varies across the world.\nContents\n1 Overview\n2 Terminology\n3 Political debate\n3.1 Privacy\n3.2 U.S. judicial involvement\n3.3 Canadian judicial involvement\n3.4 Worldwide stances\n3.4.1 Countries that refuse abortions\n3.4.2 Countries with strict laws\n3.5 Effects of legalization/illegalization\n4 Personhood\n4.1 Fetal pain\n4.2 Fetal personhood\n4.3 Arguments for abortion rights which do not depend on fetal non-personhood\n4.3.1 Bodily rights\n4.3.2 Freedom and equality\n4.3.3 Impacts of criminalization\n4.3.4 Inefficacy of abortion bans on reducing abortion\n4.3.5 Abortion safety\n4.3.6 Population planning\n4.4 Arguments against abortion\n4.4.1 Discrimination\n4.4.2 Deprivation\n4.4.3 Argument from uncertainty\n4.4.4 Slippery slope\n4.4.5 Religious beliefs\n4.5 Other factors\n4.5.1 Mexico City policy\n4.5.2 Public opinion\n4.5.3 Effect upon crime rate\n4.5.4 Breast cancer hypothesis\n4.5.5 Minors\n5 See also\n6 Notes\n7 References\n8 External links\nOverview[edit]\nIn ancient times, issues such as abortion and infanticide were evaluated within the contexts of family planning, gender selection, population control, and the property rights of the patriarch. [3] Rarely were the rights of the prospective mother, much less the prospective child, taken into consideration. [4] Then, as now, these discussions often concerned the nature of humankind, the existence of a soul, when life begins, and the beginning of human personhood.[5]\nDiscussion of the putative personhood of the fetus may be complicated by the current legal status of children. Like children or minors in the U.S. a fetus or an embryo is not legally a \"person\", not having reached the age of majority and not deemed able to enter into contracts and sue or be sued. [6] Since the 1860s, they have been treated as persons for the limited purposes of offence against the person law in the UK including N. Ireland, although this treatment was amended by the Abortion Act of 1967 in England, Scotland and Wales. [7] Furthermore, there are logistic difficulties in treating a fetus as \"the object of direct action.\"  As one New Jersey Superior Court judge noted, \"If a fetus is a person, it is a person in very special circumstances – it exists entirely within the body of another much larger person and usually cannot be the object of direct action by another person.\" [8] Proposals in the current debate range from complete prohibition, even if the procedure is necessary to save the mother's life, [9] to complete legalization with public funding. [10]\nTerminology[edit]\nIt has been suggested that Abortion-rights movements#Terminology be merged into this section. (Discuss) Proposed since February 2021.\nMany of the terms used in the debate are seen as political framing: terms used to validate one's own stance while invalidating the opposition's. [11] For example, the labels \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life\" imply endorsement of widely held values such as liberty or the right to life, while suggesting that the opposition must be \"anti -choice\" or \"anti -life\". [12] Terms used by some in the debate to describe their opponents include \"pro-abortion\" or \"pro-abort \". However, these terms do not always reflect a political view or fall along a binary; in one Public Religion Research Institute poll, seven in ten Americans described themselves as \"pro-choice\" while almost two-thirds described themselves as \"pro-life\". [13] Another identifier in the debate is \"abolitionist\", which harks back to the 19th-century struggle against human slavery.[14] [15] Some Native women have critiqued these terms as not representing their views, as they do not see reproductive decisions as a choice but rather a responsibility, and while they feel that life is sacred, they also see abortion as, sometimes, a necessity. [16]\nAppeals are often made in the abortion debate to the rights of the fetus, pregnant woman, or other parties.  Such appeals can generate confusion if the type of rights is not specified (whether civil, natural, or otherwise) or if it is simply assumed that the right appealed to takes precedence over all other competing rights (an example of begging the question ).\nThe appropriate terms with which to designate the human organism prior to birth are also debated. The medical terms \"embryo\" and \"fetus\" are seen by some anti-abortion advocates as dehumanizing,[17] [18] while everyday terms such as \"baby\" or \"child\" are viewed as sentimental by some abortion rights advocates.[citation needed]\nThe use of the term \"baby\" to describe the unborn human organism is seen by some scholars as part of an effort to assign the organism agency. This assignation of agency functions to further the construction of fetal personhood.[19] [20]\nAnti-abortion activists occasionally use the term the \"Silent Holocaust\" in reference to the number of abortions that have been performed in the United States since 1973. [21]\nPolitical debate[edit]\nThere is abundant debate regarding the extent of abortion regulation.  Some abortion rights advocates argue that it should be illegal for governments to regulate abortion any more than other medical practices. [22] On both sides of the debate, some argue[who?] that governments should be permitted to prohibit elective abortions after the 20th week, [23] viability,[24] or the second trimester.[25] Some want to prohibit all abortions, starting from conception. [26]\nPrivacy[edit]\nThe examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this section, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new section, as appropriate.(March 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nEven though the right to privacy is not explicitly stated in many constitutions of sovereign nations, many people see it as foundational to a functioning democracy. In general the right to privacy can be found to rest on the provisions of habeas corpus, which first found official expression under Henry II in 11th century England, but has precedent in Anglo-Saxon law. This provision guarantees the right to freedom from arbitrary government interference, as well as due process of law. This conception of the right to privacy is operant in all countries which have adopted English common law through Acts of Reception. The Law of the United States rests on English common law by this means.\nTime has stated that the issue of bodily privacy is \"the core\" of the abortion debate. [27] Time defined privacy, in relation to abortion, as the ability of a woman to \"decide what happens to her own body\". [27] In political terms, privacy can be understood as a condition in which one is not observed or disturbed by government. [28]\nTraditionally, American courts have located the right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment, Ninth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the penumbra of the Bill of Rights. The landmark decision Roe v Wade relied on the 14th Amendment, which guarantees that federal rights shall be applied equally to all persons born in the United States. The 14th Amendment has given rise to the doctrine of Substantive due process, which is said to guarantee various privacy rights, including the right to bodily integrity .\nWhile governments are allowed to invade the privacy of their citizens in some cases, they are expected to protect privacy in all cases lacking a compelling state interest. In the US, the compelling state interest test has been developed in accordance with the standards of strict scrutiny.  In Roe v Wade, the Court decided that the state has an \"important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life\" from the point of viability on, but that prior to viability, the woman's fundamental rights are more compelling than that of the state.\nAlbert Wynn and Gloria Feldt at the U.S. Supreme Court to rally in support of Roe v. Wade.\nU.S. judicial involvement[edit]\nMain article: Abortion in the United States\nRoe v. Wade struck down state laws banning abortion in 1973. Over 20 cases have addressed abortion law in the United States, all of which upheld Roe v. Wade. Since Roe, abortion has been legal throughout the country, but states have placed varying regulations on it, from requiring parental involvement in a minor's abortion to restricting late-term abortions .\nLegal criticisms of the Roe decision address many points, among them are several suggesting that it is an overreach of judicial powers, [29] or that it was not properly based on the Constitution, [30] or that it is an example of judicial activism and that it should be overturned so that abortion law can be decided by legislatures. [31] Justice Potter Stewart, who joined with the majority, viewed the Roe opinion as  \"legislative\" and asked that more consideration be paid to state legislatures. [32]\nCandidates competing for the Democratic nomination for the 2008 Presidential election cited Gonzales v. Carhart as judicial activism. [33] In upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Carhart is the first judicial opinion upholding a legal barrier to a specific abortion procedure.\nWhere, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases, its [505 U.S. 833, 867] decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution [...W]hatever the premises of opposition may be, only the most convincing justification under accepted standards of precedent could suffice to demonstrate that a later decision overruling the first was anything but a surrender to political pressure and an unjustified repudiation of the principle on which the Court staked its authority in the first instance.\n—  Majority opinion of Planned Parenthood v. Casey.[34] [35]\nQuite to the contrary, by foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouses, by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and intensifies the anguish [over abortion].\n—  Justice Antonin Scalia, \"concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part\". [35]\n\"No to abortion\" at a 2007 meeting with Pope Benedict XVI in São Paulo, Brazil.\nCanadian judicial involvement[edit]\nMain article: Abortion in Canada\nWith R v. Morgentaler, a 5–2 majority of the Supreme Court of Canada held that the abortion provisions of the Criminal Code were unconstitutional. The majority of the Court held that the abortion provisions infringed the rights of pregnant women, contary to the security of the person clause of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and could not be justified. The only laws currently governing abortion in Canada are those which govern medical procedures in general, such as those regulating licensing of facilities, the training of medical personnel, and the like. Laws also exist which are intended to prevent anti-abortion activists from interfering with staff and patient access to hospitals and clinics, for instance by creating buffer zones around them.\nBecause the courts did not establish abortion as a constitutional right, Parliament continues to have jurisdiction to legislate with respect to abortion. The Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney twice attempted to do. The first bill, introduced in 1988, was defeated in the House of Commons.  The next year, in 1989, the Mulroney government introduced a bill that would allow abortion only if two doctors certified that the woman's health was in danger. This bill passed the House of Commons but was defeated by a tie vote in the Senate.  There have not been any further government attempts to enact legisation relating to abortion in Parliament since then.\nAlthough the courts have not ruled on the question of fetal personhood, the question has been raised in two cases, Tremblay v. Daigle and R. v. Sullivan. Both cases relied on the born alive rule, inherited from English common law, to determine that the fetus was not a person at law.\nTwo further cases are notable: Dobson (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dobson, and Winnipeg Child & Family Services (Northwest Area) v. G . (D.F.), [I9971 3 S.C.R. 925 M], which dismissed so-called fetal abuse charges.\nWorldwide stances[edit]\nMain article: Abortion law\nCountries that refuse abortions[edit]\nAs of 2016, there are five countries that completely outlaw abortion: El Salvador, Malta, Vatican City, the Dominican Republic, Philippines, and Nicaragua. This bans women from an abortion for any reason (underage, fetal impairment, rape/incest ), even if it might mean saving her life. [36] [37] Penalties include jail time.\nCountries with strict laws[edit]\nThe October 2020 Polish protests were caused by severe changes to abortion laws.\nArgentina allowed abortion only in case of rape or if the mother's health was at risk. In December 2020, the Argentine Senate passed a bill to legalize abortion. Also in 2020, the Constitutional Tribunal ended almost all legal abortion in Poland.[38] China has a free abortion policy but some studies show that its government also uses forced abortion to enforce strict limits on how many children each family can have. [36]\nEffects of legalization/illegalization[edit]\nAbortion rights advocates argue that illegalization of abortion increases the incidence of unsafe abortions, as the availability of professional abortion services decreases, and leads to increased maternal mortality. According to a global study collaboratively conducted by the World Health Organization and the Guttmacher Institute, most unsafe abortions occur where abortion is illegal.[39] Withholding access to safe abortions results in 30,000 abortion releated deaths per year. Women may also choose suicide when abortion is illegal. [40]\nThe effect on crime of legalized abortion is a subject of controversy, with proponents of the theory generally arguing that \"unwanted children\" are more likely to become criminals and that an inverse correlation is observed between the availability of abortion and subsequent crime. [41]\nEconomist George Akerlof has argued that the legalization of abortion in the United States contributed to a declining sense of paternal duty among biological fathers and to a decline in shotgun weddings, even when women chose childbirth over abortion, and thus to an increase rather than a decrease in the rate of children born to unwed mothers. [42] [43]\nPersonhood[edit]\nThere are differences of opinion as to whether a zygote/embryo/fetus acquires \"personhood\" or was always a \"person\".  If \"personhood\" is acquired, opinions differ about when this happens.\nTraditionally, the concept of personhood entailed the soul, a metaphysical concept referring to a non-corporeal or extra-corporeal dimension of human being. Today, the concepts of subjectivity and intersubjectivity, personhood, mind, and self have come to encompass a number of aspects of human being previously considered the domain of the \"soul\". [44] [45] Thus, while the historical question has been: when does the soul enter the body, in modern terms, the question could be put instead: at what point does the developing individual develop personhood or selfhood. [46]\nSince the zygote is genetically identical to the embryo, the fully formed fetus, and the baby, the notion of acquired personhood could lead to an instance of the Sorites paradox, also known as the paradox of the heap.[47]\nRelated issues attached to the question of the beginning of human personhood include the legal status, bodily integrity, and subjectivity of the pregnant woman [48] and the philosophical concept of \"natality\" (i.e. \"the distinctively human capacity to initiate a new beginning\", which a new human life embodies). [49]\nIn the 1973 US judgment Roe v Wade, the opinion of the justices included the following statement:\nWe need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer. [50]\nFetal pain[edit]\nSee also: Prenatal perception\nThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(December 2011)\nThe existence and implications of fetal pain are part of a larger debate about abortion. A 2005 multidisciplinary systematic review in JAMA in the area of fetal development found that a fetus is unlikely to feel pain until after the sixth month of pregnancy. [51] [52] Developmental neurobiologists suspect that the establishment of thalamocortical connections (at about 26 weeks) may be critical to fetal perception of pain. [53] However, legislation was proposed by anti-abortion advocates that would require abortion providers to tell a woman that the fetus may feel pain during an abortion procedure if the woman's proposed abortion was at least 20 weeks after fertilization. [54]\nThe 2005 JAMA review concluded that data from dozens of medical reports and studies indicate that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain until the third trimester of pregnancy. [51] However a number of medical critics have since disputed these conclusions. [52] [55] Other researchers such as Anand and Fisk have challenged the idea that pain cannot be felt before 26 weeks, positing instead that pain can be felt at around 20 weeks. [56] Anand's suggestion is disputed in a March 2010 report on fetal awareness published by a working party of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, citing a lack of evidence or rationale. [57] Page 20 of the report definitively states that the fetus cannot feel pain prior to week 24. Because pain can involve sensory, emotional and cognitive factors, leaving it \"impossible to know\" when painful experiences are perceived, even if it is known when thalamocortical connections are established. [58]\nWendy Savage—press officer, Doctors for a Woman's Choice on Abortion—considers the question to be irrelevant. In a 1997 letter to the British Medical Journal,[59] she noted that the majority of surgical abortions in Britain were performed under general anesthesia which affects the fetus, and considers the discussion \"to be unhelpful to women and to the scientific debate.\" Others caution against unnecessary use of fetal anesthetic during abortion, as it poses potential health risks to the pregnant woman. [51] David Mellor and colleagues have noted that the fetal brain is already awash in naturally occurring chemicals that keep it sedated and anesthetized until birth. [60] At least one anesthesia researcher has suggested the fetal pain legislation may make abortions harder to obtain because abortion clinics lack the equipment and expertise to supply fetal anesthesia. Anesthesia is administered directly to fetuses only while they are undergoing surgery. [56]\nFetal personhood[edit]\nMain article: Beginning of human personhood\nAlthough the two main sides of the abortion debate tend to agree that a human fetus is biologically and genetically human (that is, of the human species), they often differ in their view on whether or not a human fetus is, in any of various ways, a person. Anti-abortion supporters argue that abortion is morally wrong on the basis that a fetus is an innocent human person [61] or because a fetus is a potential life that will, in most cases, develop into a fully functional human being. [62] They believe that a fetus is a person upon conception. Others reject this position by drawing a distinction between human being and human person, arguing that while the fetus is innocent and biologically human, it is not a person with a right to life.[63] In support of this distinction, some propose a list of criteria as markers of personhood.  For example, Mary Ann Warren suggests consciousness (at least the capacity to feel pain), reasoning, self-motivation, the ability to communicate, and self-awareness.[64] According to Warren, a being need not exhibit all of these criteria to qualify as a person with a right to life, but if a being exhibits none of them (or perhaps only one), then it is certainly not a person.  Warren concludes that as the fetus satisfies only one criterion, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain ), [65] the fetus is not a person and abortion is therefore morally permissible.  Other philosophers apply similar criteria, concluding that a fetus lacks a right to life because it lacks brain waves or higher brain function, [66] self-consciousness, [67] rationality, [68] and autonomy. [69] These lists diverge over precisely which features confer a right to life, [70] but tend to propose various developed psychological or physiological features not found in fetuses.\nCritics of this typically argue that some of the proposed criteria for personhood would disqualify two classes of born human beings – reversibly comatose patients, and human infants – from having a right to life, since they, like fetuses, are not self-conscious, do not communicate, and so on. [71] Defenders of the proposed criteria may respond that the reversibly comatose do satisfy the relevant criteria because they \"retain all their unconscious mental states\". [72] or at least some higher brain function (brain waves). Warren concedes that infants are not \"persons\" by her proposed criteria, [73] and on that basis she and others, including the moral philosopher Peter Singer, conclude that infanticide could be morally acceptable under some circumstances (for example if the infant is severely disabled [74] or in order to save the lives of several other infants. [75] )\nAn alternative approach is to base personhood or the right to life on a being's natural or inherent capacities.  On this approach, a being essentially has a right to life if it has a natural capacity to develop the relevant psychological features; and, since human beings do have this natural capacity, they essentially have a right to life beginning at conception (or whenever they come into existence). [76] Critics of this position argue that mere genetic potential is not a plausible basis for respect (or for the right to life), and that basing a right to life on natural capacities would lead to the counterintuitive position that anencephalic infants, irreversibly comatose patients, and brain-dead patients kept alive on a medical ventilator, are all persons with a right to life. [77] Respondents to this criticism argue that the noted human cases in fact would not be classified as persons as they do not have a natural capacity to develop any psychological features. [78] [79] [80] Also, in a view that favors benefiting even unconceived but potential future persons, it has been argued as justified to abort an unintended pregnancy in favor for conceiving a new child later in better conditions. [81]\nMembers of Bound4LIFE in Washington, D.C. symbolically cover their mouths with red tape.\nPhilosophers such as Aquinas use the concept of individuation. They argue that abortion is not permissible from the point at which individual human identity is realized. Anthony Kenny argues that this can be derived from everyday beliefs and language and one can legitimately say \"if my mother had had an abortion six months into her pregnancy, she would have killed me\" then one can reasonably infer that at six months the \"me\" in question would have been an existing person with a valid claim to life. Since division of the zygote into twins through the process of monozygotic twinning can occur until the fourteenth day of pregnancy, Kenny argues that individual identity is obtained at this point and thus abortion is not permissible after two weeks. [82]\nArguments for abortion rights which do not depend on fetal non-personhood[edit]\nBodily rights[edit]\nAn argument first presented by Judith Jarvis Thomson states that even if the fetus is a person and has a right to life, abortion is morally permissible because a woman has a right to control her own body and its life-support functions (i.e. the right to life does not include the right to be kept alive by another person's body). Thomson's variant of this argument draws an analogy between forcing a woman to continue an unwanted pregnancy and forcing a person to allow his body to be used to maintain blood homeostasis (as a dialysis machine is used) for another person suffering from kidney failure.  It is argued that just as it would be permissible to \"unplug\" and thereby cause the death of the person who is using one's kidneys, so it is permissible to abort the fetus (who similarly, it is said, has no right to use one's body's life-support functions against one's will). [83]\nCritics of this argument generally argue that there are morally relevant disanalogies between abortion and the kidney failure scenario.  For example, it is argued that the fetus is the woman's child as opposed to a mere stranger; [84] that abortion kills the fetus rather than merely letting it die; [85] and that in the case of pregnancy arising from voluntary intercourse, the woman has either tacitly consented to the fetus using her body, [86] or has a duty to allow it to use her body since she herself is responsible for its need to use her body. [87] Some writers defend the analogy against these objections, arguing that the disanalogies are morally irrelevant or do not apply to abortion in the way critics have claimed. [88]\nAlternative scenarios have been put forth as more accurate and realistic representations of the moral issues present in abortion. John Noonan proposes the scenario of a family who was found to be liable for frostbite finger loss suffered by a dinner guest whom they refused to allow to stay overnight, although it was very cold outside and the guest showed signs of being sick. It is argued that just as it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation for the guest to protect him from physical harm, it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation of a fetus. [89]\nOther critics claim that there is a difference between artificial and extraordinary means of preservation, such as medical treatment, kidney dialysis, and blood transfusions, and normal and natural means of preservation, such as gestation, childbirth, and breastfeeding. They argue that if a baby was born into an environment in which there was no replacement available for her mother's breast milk, and the baby would either breastfeed or starve, the mother would have to allow the baby to breastfeed.  But the mother would never have to give the baby a blood transfusion, no matter what the circumstances were.  The difference between breastfeeding in that scenario and blood transfusions is the difference between using one's body as a kidney dialysis machine, and gestation and childbirth. [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95]\nFreedom and equality[edit]\nMargaret Sanger wrote: \"No woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother.\" From this perspective the right to abortion can be construed to be necessary in order for women to achieve equality with men whose freedom is not nearly so restricted by having children. [96]\nImpacts of criminalization[edit]\nSome activists and academics, such as Andrea Smith, argue that the criminalization of abortion furthers the marginalization of oppressed groups such as poor women and women of color. Sending these women into the prison system would do nothing to address the social/political/economic problems that marginalize these women or, sometimes, cause them to require abortions. [97]\nInefficacy of abortion bans on reducing abortion[edit]\nResearch has been conducted exploring whether banning abortion actually reduces abortion rates. Researchers from the Guttmacher Institute, the World Health Organization, and the University of Massachusetts concluded that, in countries where abortions were restricted, the number of unintended pregnancies increased and the proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion also increased. [98] The following table taken from their research shows these findings in greater detail:\nTable: Rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion, and proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion, by legal status of abortion for years 2015–19\nUnintended pregnancy rate per 1000 women aged between 15 and 49 years\nAbortion rate per 1000 women aged between 15 and 49 years\nUnintended pregnancies ending in abortion (%)\n1990–94 (80% UI)\n2015–19 (80% UI)\nChange from 1990–94 to 2015–19 (80% UI)\nProbability of change (%)\n1990–94 (80% UI)\n2015–19 (80% UI)\nChange from 1990–94 to 2015–19 (80% UI)\nProbability of change (%)\n1990–94 (80% UI)\n2015–19 (80% UI)\nChange from 1990–94 to 2015–19 (80% UI)\nProbability of change (%)\nAbortion broadly legal\n72 (66 to 80)\n58 (53 to 66)\n−19% (−28 to −9)\n99%\n44 (39 to 49)\n40 (36 to 47)\n−8% (−20 to 9)\n73%\n61 (56 to 65)\n70 (65 to 73)\n15% (8 to 23)\n100%\nAbortion broadly legal (excluding India and China)\n76 (72 to 80)\n50 (46 to 54)\n−34% (−39 to −29)\n100%\n46 (43 to 50)\n26 (24 to 30)\n−43% (−49 to −36)\n100%\n61 (59 to 63)\n53 (50 to 56)\n−13% (−18 to −8)\n100%\nAbortion restricted\n91 (86 to 97)\n73 (68 to 79)\n−20% (−25 to −14)\n100%\n33 (28 to 38)\n36 (32 to 42)\n12% (−4 to 30)\n82%\n36 (32 to 39)\n50 (46 to 53)\n39% (27 to 53)\n100%\nAbortion prohibited altogether\n110 (100 to 123)\n80 (70 to 91)\n−27% (−35 to −19)\n100%\n35 (27 to 48)\n40 (31 to 51)\n11% (−14 to 40)\n70%\n32 (27 to 39)\n50 (44 to 55)\n52% (30 to 78)\n100%\nAbortion permitted to save the woman's life\n86 (80 to 93)\n70 (63 to 77)\n−19% (−26 to −12)\n100%\n31 (27 to 38)\n36 (30 to 43)\n15% (−3 to 35)\n85%\n36 (33 to 41)\n52 (48 to 56)\n41% (28 to 57)\n100%\nAbortion permitted to preserve health\n92 (86 to 99)\n75 (70 to 81)\n−18% (−24 to −12)\n100%\n33 (28 to 38)\n36 (31 to 41)\n8% (−8 to 27)\n73%\n36 (32 to 39)\n47 (44 to 51)\n32% (20 to 47)\n100%\nUI=uncertainty interval.\nAbortion safety[edit]\nEven where abortions are illegal, they continue to take place, however, they are generally done unsafely, both because the need for secrecy tends to be more important than the woman's safety, and due to the lack of training and experience the person performing the abortion. When done correctly by properly trained doctors, abortion is generally safe. Where laws restrict rights to abortion, abortions are less safe and result in the deaths of 30,000 women each year. [99]\nPopulation planning[edit]\nIt has been suggested that access to abortion can help reduce human overpopulation,[100] which is shown to be harmful to the natural environment.[101]\nArguments against abortion[edit]\nAbortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion.\nDiscrimination[edit]\nThe book Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation presents the argument that abortion involves unjust discrimination against the unborn. According to this argument, those who deny that fetuses have a right to life do not value all human life, but instead, select arbitrary characteristics (such as particular levels of physical or psychological development) as giving some human beings more value or rights than others. [102]\nIn contrast, philosophers who define the right to life by reference to particular levels of physical or psychological development typically maintain that such characteristics are morally relevant, [103] and reject the assumption that all human life necessarily has value (or that membership in the species Homo sapiens is in itself morally relevant). [104]\nSome abortion opponents have argued for, and promoted legislation for, a ban on the abortion of fetuses that have been diagnosed with Down Syndrome on the basis that such abortions unfairly discriminate against the disabled.[105][better source needed] Critics of these measures charge that they are hypocritical since many of their proponents appear to be unconcerned with addressing the needs of living disabled persons. [106] In response to one such proposed measure in North Carolina, a spokesperson for Disability Rights North Carolina commented, \"We would never think of using limits on someone’s bodily autonomy to protect our rights.\" [105][better source needed]\nDeprivation[edit]\nFurther information: Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate § The deprivation argument\nThe argument of deprivation states that abortion is morally wrong because it deprives the fetus of a valuable future. [107] On this account, killing an adult human being is wrong because it deprives the victim of a future like ours —a future containing highly valuable or desirable experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments. [108] If a being has such a future, then (according to the argument) killing that being would seriously harm the fetus and hence would be seriously wrong. [109] But since a fetus does have such a future, the \"overwhelming majority\" of deliberate abortions are placed in the \"same moral category\" as killing an innocent adult human being. [110] Not all abortions are unjustified according to this argument: abortion would be justified if the same justification could be applied to killing an adult human. [111]\nCriticism of this line of reasoning follows several threads. Some reject the argument on grounds relating to personal identity, holding that the fetus is not the same entity as the adult into which it will develop, and thus that the fetus does not have a \"future like ours\" in the required sense. [112] Others grant that the fetus has a future like ours, but argue that being deprived of this future is not a significant harm or a significant wrong to the fetus, because there are relatively few psychological connections (continuations of memory, belief, desire and the like) between the fetus as it is now and the adult into which it will develop. [113] Another criticism is that the argument creates inequalities in the wrongness of killing: [114] as the futures of some people appear to be far more valuable or desirable than the futures of other people, the argument appears to entail that some killings are far more wrong than others, or that some people have a far stronger right to life than others—a conclusion that is taken to be counterintuitive or unacceptable.[citation needed]\nThe 2004 March for Women's Lives near the Washington Monument.\nArgument from uncertainty[edit]\nSome anti-abortion supporters argue that if there is uncertainty as to whether the fetus has a right to life, then having an abortion is equivalent to consciously taking the risk of killing another. According to this argument, if it is not known for certain whether something (such as the fetus) has a right to life, then it is reckless and morally wrong to treat that thing as if it lacks a right to life (for example by killing it). [115] This would place abortion in the same moral category as manslaughter (if it turns out that the fetus has a right to life) or certain forms of criminal negligence (if it turns out that the fetus does not have a right to life). [116]\nDavid Boonin replies that if this kind of argument were correct, then the killing of nonhuman animals and plants would also be morally wrong because Boonin contends it is not known for certain that such beings lack a right to life. [117] Boonin also argues that arguments from uncertainty fail because the mere fact that one might be mistaken in finding certain arguments persuasive (for example, arguments for the claim that the fetus lacks a right to life) does not mean that one should act contrary to those arguments or assume them to be mistaken. [118]\nSlippery slope[edit]\nOne argument used by anti-abortion activists is the slippery slope argument, that normalizing abortion may lead to the normalization of other practices such as euthanasia.[119]\nReligious beliefs[edit]\nMain article: Religion and abortion\nEach religion has many varying views on the moral implications of abortion. These views can often be in direct opposition to each other. [120] Muslims typically cite the Quranic verse 17:31 which states that a fetus shouldn't be aborted out of fear of poverty. [121] [122] Christians who oppose abortion may support their views with Scripture references such as that of Luke 1:15; Jeremiah 1:4–5; Genesis 25:21–23; Matthew 1:18; and Psalm 139:13–16. The Catholic Church believes that human life begins at conception, as does the right to life; thus, abortion is considered immoral. [123] The Church of England also considers abortion to be morally wrong, though their position admits abortion when \"the continuance of a pregnancy threatens the life of the mother\". [124]\nOther factors[edit]\nMexico City policy[edit]\nMain article: Mexico City policy\nThe Mexico City policy is a policy of the US federal government concerning US funding for abortions outside of the US.[clarification needed] Known by critics as the \"global gag rule\"[citation needed], the policy required any non-governmental organization receiving U.S. government funding to refrain from performing or promoting abortion services in other countries. This had a significant effect on the health policies of many nations across the globe. The Mexico City policy was instituted under President Reagan, suspended under President Clinton, reinstated by President George W. Bush,[125] and suspended again by President Barack Obama on 24 January 2009 [126] and re-instated once again by President Donald J. Trump on 23 January 2017. [127] [128] [129] In 2021 President Biden rescinded the Mexico City policy. [130]\nPublic opinion[edit]\nMain article: Societal attitudes towards abortion\nA number of opinion polls around the world have explored public opinion regarding the issue of abortion. Results have varied from poll to poll, country to country, and region to region, while varying with regard to different aspects of the issue.\nA May 2005 survey examined attitudes toward abortion in 10 European countries, asking respondents whether they agreed with the statement, \"If a woman doesn't want children, she should be allowed to have an abortion\". The highest level of approval was 81% (in the Czech Republic); the lowest was 47% (in Poland). [131] In 2019, already 58% of Poles supported abortion on request up to the 12th week of pregnancy. [132]\nIn North America, a December 2001 poll surveyed Canadian opinion on abortion, asking in what circumstances they believe abortion should be permitted; 32% responded that they believe abortion should be legal in all circumstances, 52% that it should be legal in certain circumstances, and 14% that it should be legal in no circumstances. A similar poll in April 2009 surveyed people in the United States about U.S. opinion on abortion; 18% said that abortion should be \"legal in all cases\", 28% said that abortion should be \"legal in most cases\", 28% said abortion should be \"illegal in most cases\" and 16% said abortion should be \"illegal in all cases\". [133] A November 2005 poll in Mexico found that 73.4% think abortion should not be legalized while 11.2% think it should be. [134]\nOf attitudes in South America, a December 2003 survey found that 30% of Argentines thought that abortion in Argentina should be allowed \"regardless of situation\", 47% that it should be allowed \"under some circumstances\", and 23% that it should not be allowed \"regardless of situation\". [135] A more recent poll now suggest that 45% of Argentineans are in favor of abortion for any reason in the first twelve weeks. This same poll conducted in September 2011 also suggests that most Argentineans favor abortion being legal when a woman's health or life is at risk (81%), when the pregnancy is a result of rape (80%) or the fetus has severe abnormalities (68%). [136] A March 2007 poll regarding the abortion law in Brazil found that 65% of Brazilians believe that it \"should not be modified\", 16% that it should be expanded \"to allow abortion in other cases\", 10% that abortion should be \"decriminalized\", and 5% were \"not sure\". [137] A July 2005 poll in Colombia found that 65.6% said they thought that abortion should remain illegal, 26.9% that it should be made legal, and 7.5% that they were unsure. [138]\nEffect upon crime rate[edit]\nMain article: Legalized abortion and crime effect\nA theory attempts to draw a correlation between the United States' unprecedented nationwide decline of the overall crime rate during the 1990s and the decriminalization of abortion 20 years prior.\nThe suggestion was brought to widespread attention by a 1999 academic paper, The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime, authored by the economists Steven D. Levitt and John Donohue. They attributed the drop in crime to a reduction in individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes: unwanted children, especially those born to mothers who are African American, impoverished, adolescent, uneducated, and single. The change coincided with what would have been the adolescence, or peak years of potential criminality, of those who had not been born as a result of Roe v. Wade and similar cases. Donohue and Levitt's study also noted that states which legalized abortion before the rest of the nation experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier, and those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions. [139]\nFellow economists Christopher Foote and Christopher Goetz criticized the methodology in the Donohue-Levitt study, noting a lack of accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as cocaine use, and recalculating based on incidence of crime per capita; they found no statistically significant results. [140] Levitt and Donohue responded to this by presenting an adjusted data set which took into account these concerns and reported that the data maintained the statistical significance of their initial paper. [141]\nSuch research has been criticized by some as being utilitarian, discriminatory as to race and socioeconomic class, and as promoting eugenics as a solution to crime. [142] [143] Levitt states in his book Freakonomics that they are neither promoting nor negating any course of action—merely reporting data as economists.\nBreast cancer hypothesis[edit]\nMain article: Abortion–breast cancer hypothesis\nThe abortion–breast cancer hypothesis posits that induced abortion increases the risk of developing breast cancer. [144] This position contrasts with some scientific data that abortion does not cause breast cancer. [145] [146] [147]\nIn early pregnancy, levels of estrogen increase, leading to breast growth in preparation for lactation. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion – before full maturity in the third trimester – then more relatively vulnerable immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. The hypothesis mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s. [148] [149] [150]\nMinors[edit]\nMain article: Minors and abortion\nMany states require some form of parental consent before an abortion is set to happen. In the United States, 37 states require the parent to have knowledge while only 21 of those states need one parent to consent. [151] Certain states have an alternative answer to the involvement of the parent by getting the judicial system involved with a judicial bypass. In those states, minors can get permission from the judge if parents are not willing to do so or if they are absent from their lives. [151]\nThese laws are known as parental involvement laws.\nThere are different guidelines for minors and abortions in every country. In most of Europe, all persons that are capable of judgment enjoy medical privacy and can decide medical matters on their own. The capability of judgment does not come at a defined age, however, and is dependent on how well the person is able to understand the decision and its consequences. For most medical procedures, the capability of judgment usually sets in at ages 12 to 14.\nSee also[edit]\nBubble zone laws\nConscience clause (medical)\nConsistent life ethic\nEmbryonic stem cell research\nEqual Protection Clause\nPaper Abortion\nFeticide\nOpposition to the legalization of abortion\nReproductive rights\nRoe effect\nSupport for the legalization of abortion\nPhilosophical aspects of the abortion debate\nNotes[edit]\n^Groome, Thomas. “To Win Again, Democrats Must Stop Being the Abortion Party.” The New York Times. 27 March 2017.

A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, \"Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you—we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.\" Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation?\n^Schwarz 1990; McMahan 2002\n^Schwarz 1990; McMahan 2002; Lee 1996\n^Warren 1973\n^McMahan 2002\n^Boonin 2003: ch 4\n^The Morality of abortion: legal and historical perspectives John T.

Hecht, MD, Head of The Cleveland Clinic's Youngstown (OH) Fertility Practice. Editorial review provided by VeriMed Healthcare Network on May 19, 2005.\nRU-486, or mifepristone (sold as Mifeprex in the US), is a synthetic hormone currently used in over 20 countries to induce abortion in the first several weeks of pregnancy. It was approved for use in the U.S. in 2000.\nDefinition of Abortion\n“Abortion” is the term used by doctors to describe any pregnancy that ends before 20 weeks. There are two types of abortions, spontaneous and induced.\nSpontaneous abortion is defined as a pregnancy that terminates (naturally, not artificially) before the 20th completed week of gestation.\nInduced abortion is the deliberate termination of pregnancy. Induced abortions can be performed surgically or can be drug-induced, which is known as “medical abortion.” Both surgical and medical methods of abortion are very effective and serious complications are rare, but the earlier in pregnancy the abortion is performed, the safer it is for the mother. RU-486 has now been used safely by millions of women around the world.\nDescription\nRU-486 blocks the action of the natural hormone progesterone, which is essential to maintain a pregnancy. RU-486 is given orally, usually followed by a second medication, misoprostol (Cytotec), which is given one to three days later to stimulate uterine contractions. This drug combination is the most predictable and widely used medical abortion regimen currently in use. Medical abortion is usually used before the first seven to nine weeks of pregnancy (counting from the last menstrual period). Although dosage regimens vary, this type of medical abortion is about 95% effective. In rare cases, the method fails to cause abortion, and a follow-up surgical abortion procedure is required.\nThere are no apparent long-term adverse health effects from RU-486 and it is not known to have an adverse effect on a woman’s future fertility. In addition to the bleeding and uterine cramping that normally accompany the abortion, other side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or chills. Ibuprofen or a mild oral narcotic may be prescribed for the cramping. Patients should contact their physician immediately if using RU-486 and wind up experiencing the following problems: very heavy vaginal bleeding, a sustained fever, or NO bleeding within 24 hours of taking the misoprostol. Patients should see the physician again within one to two weeks of taking RU-486 to ensure that a complete abortion has occurred.\nApproximately 2% of all pregnancies are ectopic, meaning that the pregnancy is lodged in one of the fallopian tubes instead of in the uterus. The mifepristone/misoprostol regimen will not reliably terminate an ectopic pregnancy. If such a patient receives RU-486, the ectopic pregnancy can continue to grow until it ruptures the tube, potentially causing dangerous internal bleeding. This is why it is important for the patient to notify the physician if vaginal bleeding does NOT occur after administration of the medications.\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to medical versus surgical abortion. The primary advantages of medical abortion include avoiding an invasive surgical procedure and anesthesia, more privacy, and a greater sense of personal control over the experience. Patients should consider and discuss their feelings and opinions about medical versus surgical abortion with their physician.", "Brief History of the Abortion Pill in the U.S.\nMenu\nWomen's Health\nNews\nBrief History of the Abortion Pill in the U.S.\nFrom the WebMD Archives\nSept. 28, 2000 -- The road toward FDA approval for the abortion pill RU-486, or mifepristone, has spanned two decades and been cluttered with at-times bitter, contentious battles between those against abortion rights and pro-choice advocates. But as of Thursday, medical abortion with RU-486 is now an option for American women.\nTo date, more than half a million women in Europe have undergone medical abortions with RU-486, as have thousands of women in the U.S. as part of clinical trials.\n\"A combination of complex business and political issues contributed to the long time it has taken to bring this product to the market,\" says Sandra Waldman, spokesperson for the Population Council, a nonprofit group marketing the drug in the U.S.\n\"I think RU-486 offers more options to women, but it won't solve all of our abortion access problems,\" says Tina Hoff, director of Public Health Information and Communication at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park, Calif. \"There are still issues to overcome including whether or not insurance will cover the cost of abortion with RU-486, whether RU-486 can be administered by non-physician providers, and how doctors will accommodate the [time] that it takes to expel the fetus,\" she tells WebMD.\nTo illustrate the long, embattled road toward approval, WebMD has put together a time line of the milestones and roadblocks in the fight to approve RU-486, both here and abroad:\n1980 -- Researchers at Roussel-Uclaf, a French pharmaceutical company, develop mifepristone (RU-486).\n1983 -- The FDA issues a testing permit to the Population Council, a nonprofit group, to conduct trials of mifepristone as an early abortion method.\n1988 -- RU-486 is approved in France, but distribution is halted in response to protests. The French Minister of Health intervenes and orders the company to return the drug to the market. Anti-abortion rights groups then threaten to boycott Hoechst A.G. (Rousell-Uclaf's parent company).\n1989 -- In response to pressure from the Bush Administration and others, the FDA bans the importation of RU-486 for personal use. Hoechst says it won't market or distribute the drug outside of France to appease groups against abortion rights.\n1990 -- Leading scientists testify before Congress that the FDA import ban has hindered research on the broad medical benefits of RU-486, including treatment for some cancers, HIV, and uterine tumors, and for inducing labor.\nJuly 1992 -- An American woman named Leona Benten issues the first direct challenge to the FDA import ban when U.S. Customs seizes the drug from her as she returns from Europe. However the U.S. Supreme Court refuses to hear her case or order the FDA to overturn the ban.\nJan. 1993 -- President Clinton asks the FDA to re-examine its import ban.\nSept. 1993 -- The Institute of Medicine suggests that an expedited new drug application be submitted to the FDA for the use of RU-486 as a method of early abortion.\n1994-1995 -- Roussel-Uclaf gives the Population Council the U.S. patent rights for RU-486. Clinical trials involving 2,100 women begin.\nMarch 1996 -- The Population Council submits a drug application to the FDA for RU-486 as an early abortion method.\nJuly 1996 -- An advisory arm of the FDA recommends approval of RU-486 as a safe and effective early nonsurgical method of abortion.\nSept. 1996 -- The FDA issues an \"approvable letter\" for RU-486 for early abortion, when used with misoprostol, a drug that causes uterine contractions to expel the embryo. The letter states that the two-drug combination is safe and effective when used under close medical supervision but notes that additional information is needed on the manufacturing process and labeling before a final decision is made.\nFeb. 1997 -- A major roadblock: The European manufacturer responsible for producing RU-486 in the U.S. cancels its contract with the Population Council -- delaying the drug's introduction in the U.S. indefinitely.\nApril 1997 -- A study in The New England Journal of Medicine shows that RU-486, when used in combination with a type of drug called a prostaglandin (misoprostol), medically terminates 92% of pregnancies when taken within 49 days of conception.\nJune 1998 -- An amendment to a bill is passed that bans the FDA from using funds to test, develop, or approve any abortion drug.\nSept. 1998 -- The Clinton administration opposes the amendment.\nOct. 1998 -- The ban is deleted from the bill.\nFeb. 2000 -- The FDA postpones approval of RU-486 until certain questions about the manufacturing and distribution of the drug are answered.\nSept. 28, 2000 -- RU-486 is approved by FDA as a method of early medical abortion.", "Doctors and activists call for advance provision of the abortion pill\n#media\n#invasion\nDoctors and activists call for advance provision of the abortion pill\nAlexandra Martinez for Prism Reports\nPrism\nSaturday December 11, 2021 9:15 AM PST\n144\n70 Comments 70 new\nRSS\nPUBLISHED TO\nAlexandra Martinez\nPrism Reports\nDaily Kos\nPro Choice\nAbortion\ngenderjustice\nPRISM\nRecommended\nSCOTUS\nSupremeCourt\nThe fate of Roe v. Wade hangs in the balance after last week’s Supreme Court hearing and the Supreme Court’s latest decision to allow Texas’ repressive Senate Bill 8 to remain in effect despite allowing abortion providers to sue state officials to block the ban. As a result, reproductive rights activists advocate for advanced provisions and abortion-by-mail options to sidestep repressive state laws on surgical abortions. While the FDA has approved the use of the abortion pill for up to 10 weeks and has lifted in-person dispensing requirements for the duration of the pandemic with a pending long-term reevaluation that could be announced as soon as next week, states like Texas are still imposing contradictory laws. Last week, on the heels of the Supreme Court’s oral arguments, Texas’ Senate Bill 4 went into effect, which criminalizes medication abortions after seven weeks and requires in-person dispensing, prohibiting pills to be mailed to patients. Activists are saying this development could cause trigger bills across other red states, placing limitations on medication abortions, adding more constraints on abortion care, and putting pregnant people at risk.\n“It’s never been more clear that anti-abortion laws are designed to stop access to abortion care and have never been about safety,” says Ana Rodriguez, campaigns director for Lilith Fund, a reproductive equity organization based in Austin, Texas. “These laws always impact Black, Indigenous, and other people of color the most. It’s a really scary time for people who need access to abortion care, as well as the network of support that wants to help people access abortion care.”\nMedication abortion, which is a protocol that involves taking two different drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, has been a safe alternative to surgical abortions in the U.S. since 2000, and in 2017 it accounted for 39% of all abortions in the country. According to a 2016 Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) study, mifepristone, otherwise known as “the abortion pill,” is medically safer than Tylenol and Viagra. But 32 states have imposed limitations that contradict World Health Organization recommendations ensuring that midlevel providers can safely provide medication abortion, two states have entirely banned the use of it at a specific starting point, and 19 states require the prescribing physician to be physically present when the medication is administered, ruling out telehealth and mail options. Under S.B. 4, medical providers who prescribe mifepristone after seven weeks, via telehealth, or dispense them through the mail will face state jail time and a fine up to $10,000.\n“We’ve had 21 years of experience with this medication, and it’s been shown to be very safe and effective,” says Dr. Daniel Grossman, director of ANSIRH. “There is no medical reason for mifepristone to have to be administered in person.”\nFor pregnant people who find themselves in states with strict abortion laws, or rural towns with few, if any, abortion care providers, and cannot afford to travel to another state for care, receiving the abortion pill by mail has been a vital resource. Despite state restrictions, initiatives like Shout Your Abortion and Aid Access raise awareness about the abortion pill and helping people acquire the medication who cannot access local abortion services.\n“Abortion pills by mail is the best way that we have to mitigate the impacts of whatever anti-choice legislation we see past in coming years,” says Amelia Bonow, founding director of Shout Your Abortion. “Even if abortion is banned in their state, we hope that people know they can still have a safe, effective abortion early in pregnancy, and they can also have a lot of support in that process.”\nMany activists are still unsure how S.B. 4 will enforce “abortion-by-mail” bans since it would imply a breach of privacy to inspect people’s mail, which is a federal offense. “[S.B. 4] is really just meant to instill fear in people who are trying to do this work,” says Nancy Cárdenas Peña, Texas director of policy and advocacy for the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice.\nGrossman is a firm advocate for advanced provision, when medication is provided before it is immediately needed, in a “wrap-around service” that would allow a clinician to provide educational information about the pills and how to recognize potential complications or recognize if they are not working. He also suggests that clinicians make themselves available to patients through the phone in case they have any questions about taking the medication. Medical and legal hotlines are available at the Repro Legal Helpline and the Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline, which is a hotline staffed by pro-choice medical professionals who will anonymously answer any questions and provide medical advice and support to self-manage an abortion.\nAlexandra Martinez is the senior news reporter at Prism.

{"query_id": "300", "generated_response": "Based on the search results, here are the main strategies for preventing and reducing global warming, with specific focus on regions like Antarctica:\n\n## Global Emission Reduction - The Primary Strategy\n\nThe most fundamental approach is **rapid global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions** [1]. Research shows that \"global action to limit greenhouse gas emissions will be essential to reduce further climate change impacts within Antarctica\" [1]. This remains the most reliable and effective long-term solution.\n\n## Geoengineering Approaches - Limited Effectiveness\n\n### Stratospheric Aerosol Injection\nScientists have studied **stratospheric sulfate aerosol injections** as a potential climate intervention, but research reveals significant limitations [2]. While this approach could reduce global surface temperatures, it **cannot effectively preserve Antarctic ice sheets** because it fails to address crucial oceanic circulation changes that drive ice shelf melting [2].\n\nThe study found that even with aerosol injection, \"continued upwelling of warm water in proximity of ice shelves\" occurs, particularly threatening the unstable Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica [2]. This demonstrates that geoengineering cannot substitute for emissions reduction.\n\n### Artificial Snow Creation\nA more radical proposal involves **creating massive amounts of artificial snow** on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet [3]. This would require:\n- 7,400 gigatons of artificial snow over 10 years\n- Enough water to \"submerge the entirety of Great Britain to a depth of 30 meters\" [3]\n- An \"unprecedented engineering effort\" with substantial environmental risks [3]\n\nWhile theoretically possible, scientists emphasize this would involve major tradeoffs and \"reducing greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible is clearly still the most reliable way to reduce the many harmful effects of climate change\" [3].\n\n## Regional Antarctic Conservation Strategies\n\nFor Antarctica specifically, **protected area management** and conservation tools can help build ecosystem resilience, though with limited scope [1]. The research shows that:\n\n- Protected areas can \"minimize additional pressures produced by human activities in the region\" [1]\n- They help manage impacts by \"increasing connectivity between populations, protecting ecosystem services, conserving biodiversity and providing locations for climate change research\" [1]\n- However, \"the application of such tools within Antarctica can only ever support a limited degree of resilience, with the requirement for rapid global decreases in greenhouse gas emissions being the only realistic means of safeguarding Antarctica\" [1]\n\n## Key Findings on Strategy Effectiveness\n\nThe research reveals a clear hierarchy of effectiveness:\n\n1. **Most Effective**: Complete greenhouse gas removal - studies show that \"removal of GHGs restores the circulation, yielding relatively cooler subsurface ocean temperatures to better preserve West Antarctica\" [2]\n\n2. **Limited Effectiveness**: Geoengineering approaches like aerosol injection cannot fully address circulation changes that drive ice melting [2]\n\n3. **Supporting Role**: Conservation and protected area management can help but cannot substitute for emissions reduction [1]\n\n## Economic Considerations\n\nWhile the search results don't provide detailed economic comparisons, they highlight the massive scale of intervention required. The artificial snow proposal alone would require engineering efforts of unprecedented scale [3], suggesting that prevention through emissions reduction would likely be more cost-effective than dealing with consequences through massive geoengineering projects.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe research strongly supports **rapid greenhouse gas emissions reduction as the primary strategy**, with other approaches playing only supplementary roles. As one study concludes, geoengineering approaches have fundamental limitations, and \"reducing greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible is clearly still the most reliable way to reduce the many harmful effects of climate change\" [3].", "citations": ["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901121001490", "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL064314", "https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1154770/Antarctica-shock-latest-news-New-York-scientists-ice-melting-climate-change-sheet"], "contexts": ["Developing resilience to climate change impacts in Antarctica: An evaluation of Antarctic Treaty System protected area policy - ScienceDirect\nEnvironmental Science & Policy\nVolume 124, October 2021, Pages 12-22\nDeveloping resilience to climate change impacts in Antarctica: An evaluation of Antarctic Treaty System protected area policy\nKevin A.

Introduction\nHuman activities continue to cause unprecedented impacts upon the global climate, largely through fossil fuel combustion and deforestation (see: https://www.ipcc.ch ). Rates of climate change vary regionally but are at their most rapid in the polar regions, with some associated impacts, such as ice melt and the resulting sea level rise, of global significance (IPCC, 2019 ). Ultimately, global action to limit greenhouse gas emissions will be essential to reduce further climate change impacts within Antarctica. However, use of available conservation tools may serve to minimise additional pressures produced by human activities in the region. Globally, protected areas have been identified as important tools to help manage the impacts of climate change on biodiversity by increasing connectivity between populations, protecting ecosystem services, conserving biodiversity and providing locations for climate change research (Hannah, 2008; Dudley et al., 2010 ). However, there has been no evaluation of the progress of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) in developing ecosystem resilience to climate change impacts through the Antarctic protected area system. While many definitions of ‘resilience’ have been developed, in this context, we use the term to mean the capacity of an ecosystem to persist or maintain function in the face of exogenous disturbance (Brand and Jax, 2007; Côté and Darling, 2010; Bastiaansen et al., 2020 ).\n1.1. Antarctic climate change\nSince widespread Antarctic meteorological records began in the 1950s, surface temperature trends within the area of Antarctic Treaty governance (south of latitude 60 °S) have been characterized by a marked warming of the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc archipelagos. Previously, little significant temperature change was observed across the rest of the continent, but recent research has detected a significant warming trend at the South Pole (Turner et al., 2019; Clem et al., 2020 ). Across Antarctica, the largest warming has been at Vernadsky station, where the annual mean temperature increased between 1951 and 2018 at a rate of 0.46 ± 0.15 °C decade −1 (equivalent to > 3 °C across the period). Along the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc archipelagos, the higher temperatures have resulted in the retreat of glaciers (Cook et al., 2005 ), the complete or partial collapse of a number of ice shelves (Mulvaney et al., 2012) and a greater frequency of precipitation occurring as rain rather than snow (Turner et al., 1997; Royles et al., 2012; Cannone et al., 2016 ). Since the late 1990s there has been a pause in warming, and even cooling, across at least parts of this region, but temperatures are still higher than in the 1950s (Turner et al., 2016) and models predict a resumption of the warming trends in the twenty-first century (Bracegirdle et al., 2019 ). However, it should be noted that the surface warming rate, as indicated by monthly mean air temperature, does not necessarily translate to other biologically relevant consequences of temperature change (Robinson et al., 2020 ).\nThat Antarctica has not experienced a broad-scale surface warming across the entire continent may be attributed, at least in part, to the anthropogenically-caused springtime loss of stratospheric ozone that has occurred each year since the early 1980s. The ‘ozone hole’ has increased the strength of the westerly winds around the Southern Ocean and reduced the poleward transport of heat towards the Antarctic, thereby to a degree ‘shielding’ the continent from much of the impact of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. However, it appears likely that the concentrations of greenhouse gases will continue to rise, with their warming influence increasing as the expected ‘healing’ of the ozone hole takes place (Bracegirdle et al., 2019 ). Therefore, under a business-as-usual scenario of continued greenhouse gas emission increases, Antarctic surface temperatures are expected to increase by ∼4 °C by 2100 compared with temperatures at end of the twentieth century (see Fig. 1 ). At a continent-wide scale, the higher temperatures are predicted to increase precipitation by about 30% and result in a 30% reduction in sea ice extent. Predicted warming could result in up to a three-fold increase in the area of ice-free ground in the central and northern Antarctic Peninsula, and ice retreat across coastal areas of continental Antarctica, with substantial impacts upon biological communities (Lee et al., 2017; Convey and Peck, 2019 ). Nevertheless, it is predicted that the surface temperature increase across the surrounding Southern Ocean will be amongst the smallest on Earth, as heat is drawn down into the ocean (see chapter 3.2 in IPCC, 2019 ).\nDownload : Download high-res image (882KB)\nDownload : Download full-size image\nFig. 1. The projected 2 m annual mean air temperature changes between the means of 1970-1999 and 2070-2099 as determined from the mean of one ensemble member from each of the currently available models used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 exercise. Data are shown for Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 245 (a) and 585 (b). The hatched areas indicate where <50% of the models project significant change or where <90% agree on the sign of the change. SSPs 245 and 585 represent respectively a stabilization of radiative forcing at 4.5 and 8.5 W per square metre by 2100, which can be regarded as essentially moderate or high greenhouse gas emission scenarios (see IPCC, 2013 for details).\n1.2. Human impact in Antarctica\nWhile climate change has resulted in profound and widespread changes in the Antarctic environment (Convey, 2011 ), scientific research and logistical activity have also led to significant local environmental impacts including non-native species introductions (Frenot et al., 2005; Hughes et al., 2015a ), major one-off (e.g., ship wreck) and chronic pollution events (Bargagli, 2005) and destruction of terrestrial and marine habitats (Tin et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, some areas of Antarctica, and the northern Antarctic Peninsula region, in particular, have seen a rapid expansion of tourism industry activities (Bender et al., 2016 ), with for example, 74,401 tourists visiting during the 2019/20 summer season (IAATO, 2019 ), albeit that the COVID-19 pandemic reduced both national operator and tourism industry activity in the short-term (Hughes and Convey, 2020 ). Tourism and national operator activities in Antarctica are also currently highly reliant on the combustion of fossil fuels, with an associated contribution to global carbon emissions.\nDirect human impacts have been largely concentrated within small areas of ice-free ground located near the coast, which are more accessible and favoured by national operators for station construction and the tourism industry for recreational visitation, yet are also home to the majority of the continent’s vegetation and terrestrial diversity, charismatic marine vertebrate colonies (penguins and seals) and marine bird breeding sites (many of which have been designated as Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) by BirdLife (see: https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/programme-additional-info/important-bird-and-biodiversity-areas-ibas )) (Hull and Bergstrom, 2006 ). Consequently, Antarctic biological communities and species have been damaged and displaced by human impacts (Tin et al., 2014; Coetzee and Chown, 2015 ), despite the requirement under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty for environmental impact assessments for all activities in Antarctica, in order to identify, avoid, minimise and mitigate impacts.\n1.3. Synergistic impacts of climate change and human activity\nAntarctic environments now face the dual and, in some cases, synergistic threats of climate change coupled with direct regional human impacts. For example, climate change has resulted in increasing surface temperatures and soil wetness as well as an expansion of ice-free areas, thereby increasing the likelihood of the establishment of non-native species introduced through increasing human activity in the region, as well as natural colonisation events (Chown et al., 2012; Duffy and Lee, 2019 ). Permafrost, snow and soil surface melting may cause mobilisation of soil pollutants from, for instance, waste dumps and other polluted sites associated with previous stations and activities, resulting in potentially adverse impacts upon local biological communities (Bockheim et al., 2013 ). Climate change has resulted in changes in sea ice distribution, and predictability and duration of the sea ice season, which has impacted upon penguin species’ food availability and access to breeding habitat (e.g., Trathan et al., 2019 ), thereby making it important to minimize any further adverse impacts caused by human disturbance. Climate warming-induced changes in the permafrost layer, soil hydrology and environmental conditions may have negative impacts upon the foundations and fabric (e.g., cladding, insulation, finishes, etc.) of Antarctic stations and infrastructure, as already seen widely in the Arctic, with historic sites and monuments, in particular, potentially vulnerable (Barr, 2008; Blanchette et al., 2010 ).\n1.4. The Antarctic protected area system\nThe Antarctic Treaty entered into force in 1961 and the Treaty area (the area south of latitude 60 °S) is now governed through consensus by the 29 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. Building upon earlier conservation agreements (Bonner and Smith, 1985; Hughes et al., 2013 ), the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was agreed at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) in 1991 and entered into force in 1998. Through the Protocol, Parties prohibit mineral resource extraction within the Treaty area and commit themselves to the comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment, designating Antarctica as a ‘ natural reserve, devoted to peace and science ’. The designation of protected areas within Antarctica has been possible since 1964 through the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (Recommendation VIII, 1964). However, the protected areas system was revised when Annex V to the Protocol (Area Protection and Management) entered into force in 2002 and established tools to facilitate protection of Antarctic locations from human impacts, including three protected area classifications: Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs), Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs) and Historic Sites and Monuments (HSMs). ASPAs represent the highest level of spatial environmental protection and can be designated to protect ‘ outstanding environmental, scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness values, any combination of those values, or on-going or planned scientific research ’ (Annex V, Article 3(1)). The drafting and approval of a management plan is a requirement as part of the process for an area to be designated as an ASPA, and entry is only allowed in accordance with a permit issued by a national governmental authority. ASMAs are designated to ‘ assist in the planning and co-ordination of activities, avoid possible conflicts, improve co-ordination between Parties or minimise environmental impacts ’ (Annex V, Article 4(1)). ASMAs are also required to have a management plan, but permits are not required for entry, and their regulations are hortatory rather than mandatory. From the Antarctic Treaty’s inception, the Treaty Parties have recognised the need to protect sites or monuments of historic interest and, in 1972, established an official list of Historic Sites and Monuments (HSMs) which now includes 89 sites (five further sites have been de-listed or subsumed into other HSMs). HSMs of the most outstanding historic value can also be designated as ASPAs, such as ASPA 155 Cape Evans, Ross Island, which contains Scott’s hut.\nThe Protocol also established the Committee on Environmental Protection (CEP), to provide advice and formulate recommendations to the Parties in connection with its implementation (Sánchez and McIvor, 2007 ). Management of protected area designation, including the required five-yearly review of management plans for ASPAs and ASMAs, has been coordinated by the CEP’s Subsidiary Group on Management Plans (SGMP).\n1.5. Status of the Antarctic protected area system\nAt present 72 ASPAs are designated. They cover an area of 3860 km 2, including 760 km 2 of ice-free ground and 1970 km 2 of near-shore marine environment (SCAR, 2019 ). Six ASPAs are wholly marine (1631 km 2) with a further five partly marine ASPAs having been referred to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) for further approval (see Decision 9 (2005); available at: https://www.ats.aq/devAS/Meetings/Measure/344) (Douglass et al., 2014 ). ASPAs are located mainly within the Antarctic Peninsula and its offshore islands and archipelagos, the Ross Sea region and on various coastal ice-free areas of East Antarctica (see Fig. 2 ). Fifteen of the 29 Consultative Parties to the ATCM are ASPA proponents and engage in the management of areas, including the revision of management plans. Independent of the national Consultative Parties, the CEP, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and CCAMLR may also propose areas for protection, but have yet to do so. ASPAs have tended to be designated close to research stations (Hughes and Grant, 2017) with 28% of ASPAs located within 3 km of a station (Shaw et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, ASPAs are generally small, with c. 55% having an area of less than 5 km 2 (Hughes and Convey, 2010 ).\nDownload : Download high-res image (947KB)\nDownload : Download full-size image\nFig. 2. Map of Antarctic showing the distribution of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs). The ASPAs are represented according to the primary reason for their designation, using categories described in Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: A – areas kept inviolate from human interference so that future comparisons may be possible with localities that have been affected by human activities; B – representative examples of major terrestrial, including glacial and aquatic, ecosystems and marine ecosystems; C – areas with important or unusual assemblages of species, including major colonies of breeding native birds or mammals; D – the type locality or only known habitat of any species; E – areas of particular interest to on-going or planned scientific research; F – examples of outstanding geological, glaciological or geomorphological features; G – areas of outstanding aesthetic and wilderness value; H – sites or monuments of recognised historic value; I – such other areas as may be appropriate to protect the values set out in Article 3 Paragraph 1 (i.e. ‘to protect outstanding environmental, scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness values, any combination of those values or on-going or planned scientific research’).\nEstimates vary concerning the amount of Antarctic ice-free ground (Burton-Johnson et al., 2016: 21,745 km 2 c.f. Terauds and Lee, 2016: 45,886 km 2) but, using these values, only between 1.7 and 3.5% is included within ASPAs. Studies suggest that the ASPA system is some way short of maturity, with many of the values identified for protection within the Protocol currently under-represented (Shaw et al., 2014; Hughes et al., 2015b, 2016a; Coetzee et al., 2017 ). Protection of biodiversity is far from comprehensive, with almost one third of the 16 currently recognised Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (ACBRs; equivalent of eco-regions) having no ASPAs for the protection of biodiversity (Terauds et al., 2012; Hughes et al., 2016a, b; Terauds and Lee, 2016 ), while many species are not represented within the region’s protected areas (Wauchope et al., 2019 ).\nAntarctica currently contains six ASMAs, with up to six nations involved in the management of each area, sometimes with input from the tourism industry and non-governmental conservation organisations. ASMA size varies from c. 100 km 2 for ASMA 4 Deception Island, South Shetland Islands to 26,344 km 2 for ASMA 5 Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Some ASMAs also contain ASPAs and HSMs, and defined zones to restrict access for scientific or conservation reasons.\nAt the same time that there has been an increasing awareness of and evidence available for climate change impacts, ASPA designation has declined by 84% since the 1980s (1980−89 c.f. 2010–2019), (Supplementary Fig. 1; Hughes and Grant, 2018) and no new ASMAs have been designated since 2008. A recent assessment of the level of protection of Antarctic biodiversity, using the Aichi Biodiversity Targets that are applied within nations across the globe as a benchmark, showed that, despite the region often being assumed to be remote and apparently pristine, its biodiversity outlook is similar to that for the rest of the planet (Chown et al., 2017 ). Nevertheless, three new ASPAs are currently under consideration within the CEP, indicating a potential reversal of recent trends.\nHere we evaluate the effectiveness of policy and environmental management practices for addressing climate change within the Antarctic protected area system, as coordinated by the CEP. We identify how climate change is considered within existing Antarctic environmental agreements and addressed in current protected area management plans. Finally, we describe recent developments in climate change policy relevant to Antarctic area protection and highlight practical steps that may enhance Antarctic ecosystem resilience to climate change.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Assessment of climate change recognition within Antarctic Treaty System agreements and policy documents\nConsiderable effort has been put into analysing Antarctic climate and trends across a range of past, present and future timescales, culminating in the 2009 SCAR Antarctic Climate Change and Environment (ACCE) report, its 2014 update, and annual update papers requested by and provided to the ATCM (Turner et al., 2009, 2014 ). Consequently, there is a strong basis of climate-related knowledge available to inform governance processes and decision-making (see Discussion). Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) documents relating to ASPAs, ASMAs and HSMs were obtained from the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat webpages at https://ats.aq/devAS/EP/ToolsForDelegates?lang=e and https://www.ats.aq/devAS/EP/GuidelinesAndProcedures?lang=e. Each document was read and references to climate change were recorded. Protection of historic sites is of little relevance to maintaining ecosystem resilience to climate change, but it is a component of the Antarctic protected area system, as overseen by the Committee for Environmental Protection and, therefore, documents on this issue were included in the study for completeness.\n2.2. Consideration of climate change within protected area management plans\nThe extent to which climate change is considered in protected area management plans was assessed for the 72 ASPAs and six ASMAs (available at https://www.ats.aq/devph/en/apa-database) by reading the documents fully and taking note of terms and topics relevant to climate change (e.g. use of terms such as ‘climate change’, ‘warming’, ‘greenhouse’, ‘global’ and discussion of topic including changes in sea-ice extent and ice retreat). Note was taken of the context in which climate change was discussed, i.e., in reference to climate change science, impacts or management action. We acknowledge the inherent biases present in our study, including those relating to limitations in the knowledge of the individuals undertaking the analyses. We also acknowledge that the issue of climate change is broad in nature and it may not always be a simple task to identify the extent to which an issue is directly related to climate change, as opposed to natural climate variability. We included in our analysis issues described in CEP guidance documents as relevant to climate change, e.g., changes in ice extent and sea ice-dependent penguin species (see Results). However, as a counter example, we excluded from our study consideration of the trampling impact on terrestrial habitats caused by the recently expanded fur seal population in the Antarctic Peninsula, South Shetland Island and South Orkney Islands, as climate change is likely to have been a more minor factor in this change, compared to others such the cessation of commercial sealing.\n2.3. Protected area management plan compliance with CEP guidance concerning climate change\nThe ‘(Revised) Guide to the preparation of management plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas’ recommends that the management plan section entitled ‘Description of values to be protected’ would be suitable for inclusion of any potential impacts likely to affect the ASPA in the context of climate change. Similarly, the ‘Guidelines for the preparation of ASMA management plans’ suggest that the ‘Aims and objectives’ sections of ASMA management plans should highlight any intention to consider climate change implications in the coordination and management of activities. Compliance with these recommendations within each of the ASPA and ASMA management plans was assessed, i.e., in terms of the degree to which climate change issues were discussed in the section ‘Description of the values to be protected’ in ASPA Management Plans, or the ‘Aims and objectives’ section of ASMA management plans.\n2.4. Climate change affecting the boundaries of protected areas\nThe section ‘Geographical co-ordinates, boundary markers and natural features’ of ASPA and ASMA management plans was examined to see if consideration had been given to potential climate change impacts when establishing, revising or considering the boundaries of the area, in accordance with CEP guidance.\n2.5. ASPAs designated for different primary reasons\nIn accordance with CEP guidelines, an ASPA management plan should state which of the nine primary reasons, set out in Annex V to the Protocol, the area was designated to protect primarily (see: Australia et al., 2019 ). Management plans were examined to determine the extent to which climate change was taken into consideration within ASPAs designated to protect different values.\n2.6. Non-native species introductions\nThe CEP’s ‘(Revised) Guide to the preparation of management plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas’ identified that the likelihood/risk of establishment of non-native species was an important climate change-related issue that should be considered within ASPA management plans. The 72 ASPA management plans were examined to determine the extent and means by which the issue of non-native species establishment was addressed.\n3. Results\n3.1. Assessment of climate change recognition within Antarctic Treaty System agreements and policy documents\nClimate change is not discussed in the Protocol or in guidance documents concerning HSMs, inspection of ASPAs, or consideration of new and revised draft ASPA and ASMA management plans (see Table 1 ). However, the ‘(Revised) Guide to the preparation of management plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas’ notes that the management plan section ‘Description of values to be protected’ could describe the ‘ potential environmental changes faced by the protected area in light of rapid warming ’, and gives examples including: (i) potential thinning of glaciers, rapid retreat of ice-shelves and exposure of new ice-free terrain; (ii) impacts on sea ice-dependent penguin species by ocean warming and declining sea ice extent; (iii) increasing risk of establishment of natural colonists originating from more northerly (and therefore less climatically severe) latitudes (in principle, these could also originate elsewhere in Antarctica) and (iv) increased establishment of anthropogenically-assisted non-native species (both from beyond or already established elsewhere within Antarctica).\nTable 1.

This guidance is provided to help ensure boundary features are static and constant, thereby avoiding confusion over boundary positioning.\n3.2. Consideration of climate change within protected area management plans\nClimate change was considered in 25 of the 72 ASPA management plans (35%) (see Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1). In almost all cases, climate change was considered primarily in the context of scientific research activities. Climate change impacts within a protected area (e.g., receding of glaciers) were described in 12 of the 72 ASPA management plans (17%). These comprised 10 of the 30 ASPAs in the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc (33%), but only two of the 42 continental ASPAs (5%). Overall, only 6% of management plans noted that climate change had already caused changes to the management of the protected area (e.g., revision to boundaries, as occurred in ASPA 126 Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands), all of which were located in the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc.\nTable 2.

Only the three ASMAs located on the Antarctic Peninsula reported climate change impacts. However, using the definitions of climate change impacts in CEP guidance documents, only the management plan for ASMA 1 Admiralty Bay, King George Island, reported management activities relating to climate change (i.e., non-native species management), albeit this would be important even in the absence of climate change.\n3.3. Protected area management plan compliance with CEP guidance concerning climate change\nOnly 15 of the 72 ASPA management plans (21%) included some direct consideration of climate change/regional warming in the section entitled ‘Description of values to be protected’ as recommended in CEP guidance documentation (5 of 30 plans in the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc (17%) and 10 of 42 plans in the continental region (24%)). In contrast, climate change-related impacts featured in the ‘Description of values to be protected’ section for Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc ASPAs more often than in those located within continental Antarctica (which may be attributed to the recorded warming in the Peninsula and Scotia Arc), with the only exception being the issue of non-native species (see Fig. 3 ). None of the ASPAs located in the continental region identified declines in sea ice extent and impacts on associated penguin populations in the ‘Description of values to be protected’ section, despite the presence of many emperor and Adélie penguin colonies.\nDownload : Download high-res image (145KB)\nDownload : Download full-size image\nFig. 3. Percentage of ASPAs with climate change-related impacts detailed in their management plan section ‘Description of values to be protected’ (as recommended in the ‘ (Revised) Guide to the preparation of management plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas ’). Of the 72 ASPAs currently designated, 30 are located in the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc, while 42 are located in continental Antarctica.\nContrary to CEP guidance documentation, text relating to climate change was not included in the ‘Aims and objectives’ section of any of the six ASMA management plans, albeit that this guidance was only agreed in 2017 (Resolution 1, 2017).\n3.4. Climate change affecting the boundaries of protected areas\nRecommendations within CEP guidance documents on the preparation of protected area management plans suggested that Parties consider potential climate change impacts when establishing or revising the boundaries of protected areas. Consideration of climate change impacts on boundaries within the management plan section ‘Geographical co-ordinates, boundary markers and natural features’ was evident in 10% of management plans for ASPAs in the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc region, compared with 5% for ASPAs located within continental Antarctica. Climate change influence on the area boundary was not considered in the management plan of any ASMA.\n3.5. ASPAs designated for different primary reasons\nThe number of areas designated as ASPAs under each of the nine stated primary reasons for protection varied greatly (see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2). For example, no ASPAs have been designated primarily to protect the type locality or only known habitat of a species (Category D) while 37 ASPAs (51%) have been designated to protect areas with major colonies of breeding birds or mammals (Category C).\nNone of the ASPAs primarily protecting aesthetic and wilderness values (Category G) or historic values (Category H) discussed climate change (in any context) within their management plans (Supplementary Table 2). Climate change impacts were reported in 22% of ASPAs protecting representative examples of major terrestrial and marine ecosystems (Category B), areas with major colonies of breeding birds or mammals (Category C) and areas of on-going or planned scientific research (Category E). However, climate change impacts were not discussed in management plans of any of the remaining categories (Categories A, F, G, H or I).\n3.6. Non-native species introductions\nNon-native species were considered in over 93% of ASPA and all six ASMA management plans, but rarely in the context of climate change or within the recommended section ‘Description of values to be protected’ (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Importantly, in most cases the management plans did not consider non-native species ‘establishment’, which may increase under climate change, but rather focused on non-native species ‘introduction’, which is itself largely unrelated to climate change and caused by direct human action. Nevertheless, two management plans did refer to planned eradication/control of non-native species within or adjacent to the area boundary.\n3.7. Reported climate change impacts within protected areas\nSeveral ASPAs show climate change impacts on the biotic and abiotic values identified within their boundaries. The reliance of most emperor penguin colonies on seasonal fast ice (Fretwell and Trathan, 2009 ), and their general dependence on this as a breeding habitat makes them vulnerable to climate change. ASPA 107 Emperor Island, Dion Islands, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, was designated in 1966 to protect the resident emperor penguin colony. However, an increase in local air temperature and a coincident decline in seasonal sea ice duration have been suggested to be associated with a decline in colony numbers and by 2009, and subsequently, no breeding population has been observed within the ASPA (Trathan et al., 2011 ). Recent modelling projections predict population declines of ≥ 50% over the twenty-first century, including colonies within the eight ASPAs designated primarily for their protection (Trathan et al., 2019 ), indicating the need for further protection of colonies located in areas predicted to be more resilient to climate change impacts.\nOn the Antarctic Peninsula, Adélie and chinstrap penguin populations have declined due to a reduction in extent and duration of sea ice, a decrease in krill abundance (which may have limited food availability), and an increase in the frequency and intensity of spring snowstorms that may have increased the mortality of chicks and eggs (Patterson et al., 2003; McClintock et al., 2008; Lynch et al., 2012 ). Within ASPA 113 Litchfield Island, Arthur Harbour, Anvers Island, Palmer Archipelago, the Adélie penguin colony disappeared over a 36-year period (1971/2–2007/8) (see Table 1 of ASPA 113 management plan) and Adélie and chinstrap penguin populations declined in ASPA 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands and ASPA 139 Biscoe Point, Anvers Island, Palmer Archipelago. In contrast, due to their greater adaptability to changing environmental conditions, gentoo penguin populations have been increasing within the Antarctic Peninsula region (Lynch et al., 2012 ). In ASPA 128, gentoo penguin numbers increased by 216% between the four-year periods of 1978−81 and 2014−18 (Korczak-Abshire, pers. comm., 2019, and Table 1 in ASPA 128 management plan; Ciaputa and Sierakowski, 1999) while a new colony that established within ASPA 139 in around 1992 had almost 3200 pairs by 2012/13 (Patterson-Fraser, pers. comm. 2010, 2014, detailed in ASPA 139 management plan).\nSubstantial ice retreat has been documented in some ASPAs. Within ASPA 128 the ice-free area increased from 20% in 1979 to more than 50% in 1999 (Battke et al., 2001 ). Some ASPA boundaries have been revised due to ice retreat, including ASPA 139. Others, including several in continental Antarctica, are subject to studies examining the impacts of climate change on ice extent or permafrost (e.g., ASPA 163, Dakshin Gangotri Glacier, Dronning Maud Land, ASPA 165 Edmonson Point, Wood Bay, Ross Sea and ASPA 174 Stornes, Larsmann Hills, East Antarctica). Ice shelf collapse has had little direct impact upon existing protected areas.\nClimate change impacts on vegetation cover, diversity and community composition have been observed, particularly within the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc, with some of the most comprehensive studies occurring outside ASPAs (Fowbert and Smith, 1994; Parnikoza et al., 2009; Favero-Longo et al., 2012; Cannone et al., 2016, 2017; Amesbury et al., 2017 ). Consequently, reports of vegetation change within ASPAs may reflect the changes seen much more generally in the region (e.g., see Grobe et al., 1997 in relation to ASPA 113) and are not always evidenced by peer-reviewed references (e.g., changes in Deschampsia antarctica occurrence in ASPA 150 Ardley Island, Maxwell Bay, King George Island). Nevertheless, the increased distribution of lichen species within ASPA 151 Lions Rump, King George Island, South Shetland Islands, has been linked to glacial retreat and local water deficit (Angiel and Dąbski, 2012 ). Furthermore, climate-related changes in moss community composition and vegetation health have also been noted within ASPA 135 North-East Bailey Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, in this case linked to regional cooling and drying due to an intensification in the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode and higher wind speeds (Robinson et al., 2018 ).\nThe risk to Antarctic biodiversity of invasion by non-native species may be exacerbated by climate change, as warmer and wetter environmental conditions may increase the likelihood of introduced non-native species establishing (Frenot et al., 2005; Chown et al., 2012; Pertierra et al., 2017a) and may provide a competitive advantage over some, but not necessarily all, native species (Galera et al., 2017, 2019; Molina-Montenegro et al., 2019 ). As has already occurred in protected areas around the world (Lui et al., 2020 ), some ASPAs and ASMAs already contain non-native species (Hughes et al., 2015a ). The non-native grass Poa annua has spread from an original introduction site within Arctowski Station to colonise parts of the deglaciated moraine in and around the area of ASPA 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay (Galera et al., 2017 ). In 2015, a slowly expanding patch of the non-native grass Poa pratensis was eradicated from near the boundary of ASPA 134 Cierva Point and offshore islands, Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula (Pertierra et al., 2017b ). Nevertheless, the eradication of small mobile cryptic invertebrate species may be practically impossible with, for instance, one such previously reported from Cierva Point (Convey and Quintana, 1997 ). It is also a challenge that virtually no monitoring programmes are in operation that might target and allow status assessment of such species (although see Hughes et al., 2019 ), and extremely limited expertise is available to identify any encountered. ASMA 4 Deception Island is the most invaded area of Antarctica, having been colonised by non-native plants and micro-invertebrates (Smith and Richardson, 2010; Greenslade et al., 2012; Enríquez et al., 2019 ). However, here, geothermal heating of soils may mask the impacts of climate change on rates of non-native species establishment and exacerbate the challenge of separating natural colonisation events from human-assisted introductions (Hughes and Convey, 2012 ).\n4. Discussion\nHere we evaluate the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting’s progress in consideration of climate change within the Antarctic protected area system. Clearly, the success of Antarctic Treaty Party efforts to provide resilience to existing and predicted climate change impacts will be limited without global action to control greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, while available local/regional conservation tools cannot reverse climate change impacts on Antarctic ecosystems, they can reduce potential additional pressures generated by human activities, such as scientific activity, tourism and fishing. Several environmental management tools, detailed in the Annexes to the Protocol, are available to reduce the impacts of human activities. These include the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process and the designation of protected areas and specially protected species (although currently only the Ross seal has this status). The capacity of these tools to afford resilience to climate change impacts will be limited by the nature, scale and extent of existing and anticipated climate change impacts but also by the efficiency and effectiveness with which they are utilised by the Treaty Parties. Creation of further protected areas encompassing a wider range of the marine and terrestrial environmental gradients would support greater climate change resilience, including by protecting species that have shifted their distribution in response to climate change (Loarie et al., 2009 ).\nThe Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, including its Annexes, makes no reference to climate change, even though it was agreed after the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (1988) and the publication of the First IPCC Assessment Report (1990). Our research shows that guidance documents provided some limited consideration of the more ‘administrative’ elements of climate change management within protected areas (e.g., effects of climate change on area boundaries), but very little consideration of how protected areas could be used in an integrated manner to provide resilience to climate change on a regional scale.\nImplementation of CEP guidance on climate change, at the scale of individual protected areas, has been patchy (at best), inconsistent and predominantly catalysed in response to ongoing changes in the Peninsula region (Table 1 ). Specifically, climate change issues were considered in 39% of the 72 ASPA and 6 ASMA management plans, most often with regard to scientific research efforts, rarely in terms of potential impacts, and even less concerning the implementation of management action to address the impacts (Table 2 ). The management action described was largely limited to the revision of the protected area boundary or the eradication or control of non-native species within or adjacent to the area. CEP guidance documents could be made more explicit and encourage Parties to move from a ‘reactive’ to a more ‘pre-emptive’ protected area management style, including forward planning for climate change impacts under anticipated scenarios (see Table 3 ).\nTable 3.

(2019).\nCurrently, the management of each individual protected area largely falls to one or a small number of proponent Parties (Hughes and Grant, 2017 ). Despite stated intentions to develop a systematic and integrated protected areas system, including to build climate change resilience (see Table 1 ), the level of international coordination has not yet been sufficient to advance beyond this rudimentary level. Rather, broader international efforts have focussed on climate change research, with slower progress on the use of existing environmental management tools to enhance ecosystem resilience to climate change impacts.\nSeveral initiatives (showing variable levels of success) over the past decade or more have attempted to integrate climate change into policymakers’ decision-making on protected areas more fully. In 2009, SCAR published the Antarctic Climate Change and Environment (ACCE) report, that presented the state of knowledge on climate change in Antarctica (Turner et al., 2009, 2014 ). Responding to this report, in April 2010, the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts (ATME) on Climate Change met in Svolvær, Norway, and adopted 30 wide-ranging Recommendations (see Supplementary Table 3). Recommendations concerning the Antarctic environment, including area protection, were passed to the CEP, which subsequently produced a Climate Change Response Work Programme (CCRWP) to facilitate their advancement (Resolution 4 (2015)). In 2017, the ATCM established the CEP Subsidiary Group on Climate Change Response (SGCCR) to facilitate the efficient implementation of the CCRWP (Decision 1 (2017)). Climate change was also added to the ATCM Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan and the CEP Five-Year Work Plan (Supplementary Table 3).\nSince the 2010 ATME on Climate Change, 21 working papers on climate change have been submitted to the ATCM and/or CEP (ATCM - 3, CEP - 13, both bodies - 5). For example, the ATCM has discussed how to respond to climate change impacts that are already evident within the region, and those that are inevitable, given recent warming (ATCM, 2019 ). However, progress on the use of new protected areas to respond to climate change has been limited. A proposed methodology to classify ASPAs according to their vulnerability to climate change was not developed further as Parties expressed concerns regarding the scope of the parameters under assessment (United Kingdom and Norway, 2011; CEP XIV Final Report). The CEP considered the potential utility of WWF’s Rapid Assessment of Circum-Arctic Ecosystem Resilience (RACER) methodology for identifying sites with biological communities likely to be resilient to climate change (e.g., United Kingdom and Norway, 2012 ). A subsequent international trial identified locations on James Ross Island and concluded that ASPA designation was appropriate, but no protected areas have been designated linked to this proposal (United Kingdom and Czech Republic, 2015 ). Despite these stalled initiatives, momentum to develop an integrated and systematic protected area system is building, largely under the auspices of SCAR together with the CEP. At ATCM XLII (2019), a report was submitted to the CEP concerning the ‘Joint SCAR/CEP workshop on further developing the Antarctic protected area system’ held in Prague, Czech Republic, in June 2019 (Australia et al., 2019 ). Points raised at the workshop included the need to consider potential future environmental threats such as climate change in identifying sites for protection, and the value of efforts to address the synergistic pressures of climate change and other pressures associated with human activity in Antarctic. Subsequently, the CEP agreed to develop guidelines to progress the systematic development of the protected area system. In parallel, SCAR is working with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) to use systematic conservation planning tools to identify how best to concurrently manage biodiversity, science and tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula region, and contribute to the sustainable management of IAATO activities into the future, which will likely need to consider climate change impacts and existing and potential new protected areas (Margules and Pressey, 2000 ​; SCAR and IAATO, 2019 ). Nevertheless, a comprehensive and systematic approach to Antarctic area protection at a regional scale has yet to be established and implemented.\n5. Conclusions and recommendations\nWhile the CEP recognises the value of an integrated protected area system to provide resilience to climate change (see Table 1 ), existing guidance on climate change impacts within protected areas has largely taken a limited view, focussing on protected areas as individual units. The provision of an integrated strategy that sets out the blueprint for the use of the wider Antarctic protected area system to provide climate change resilience has yet to be developed. The challenge for the Antarctic scientific community, potentially led by SCAR, will be to (i) help policy makers understand the scope of existing and future climate change impacts on Antarctic environments and ecosystems, and (ii) demonstrate, in a practical and implementable way, how existing conservation and management tools within the Antarctic Treaty System might be used to addressing these impacts at a regional level. Designation of a number of new protected areas (including a potential move toward designation of a smaller number of larger areas) and integration of existing areas are likely to be components of a practical solution. Facilitating this, researchers could provide information on the distribution of recognised biotic and abiotic values, the predicted spatial extent of climate change under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios and likely impacts upon biological groups, ecosystems and environments. Researchers could also consider the characteristics of locations that may act as climate change refugia, including candidate sites. Consultation with existing stakeholders (including the tourism industry, Antarctic national governmental operators and NGOs) will be essential for the effective designation of protected areas to provide resilience to climate change.\nRecent dramatic declines in rates of ASPA and ASMA designation are a cause for concern due to the pressing need for use of these tools both to build a properly representative protected area system of appropriate scale (Coetzee et al., 2017) and to develop climate change resilience. The developing momentum within SCAR and the CEP to use available tools to enhance climate change resilience could improve the protection of Antarctica, and the values and features that make it unique. Nevertheless, the application of such tools within Antarctica can only ever support a limited degree of resilience, with the requirement for rapid global decreases in greenhouse gas emissions being the only realistic means of safeguarding Antarctica as we know it for future generations.\nAuthor statement\nKevin Hughes: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Writing initial draft, Writing - review & editing, Visualization, Project administration Peter Convey: Validation, Writing initial draft, Writing - review & editing John Turner: Writing initial draft, Writing - review & editing, Visualization\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors report no declarations of interest.\nAcknowledgements\nThis paper contributes to the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Polar Science for Planet Earth ‘Biodiversity, Evolution and Adaptation’ Team, the BAS Environment Office Long Term Monitoring and Survey project (EO-LTMS) and the ‘State of the Antarctic Ecosystem’ (AntEco) and ‘Integrated Science to Inform Antarctic and Southern Ocean Conservation’ (Ant-ICON) research programmes of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR).

However, changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation that can significantly influence the rate of basal melting of Antarctic marine ice shelves and the associated SLR have not previously been considered. Here we use a fully coupled global climate model to investigate whether rapidly increasing stratospheric sulfate aerosol concentrations after a period of global warming could preserve Antarctic ice sheets by cooling subsurface ocean temperatures. We contrast this climate engineering method with an alternative strategy in which all greenhouse gases (GHG) are returned to preindustrial levels. We find that the rapid addition of a stratospheric aerosol layer does not effectively counteract surface and upper level atmospheric circulation changes caused by increasing GHGs, resulting in continued upwelling of warm water in proximity of ice shelves, especially in the vicinity of the already unstable Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. By contrast, removal of GHGs restores the circulation, yielding relatively cooler subsurface ocean temperatures to better preserve West Antarctica.\n1 Introduction\nThe retreat of the Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers has accelerated, with a rapid collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) possible within as little as a few centuries [Joughin et al., 2014; Rignot et al., 2014; Favier et al., 2014 ]. Estimates of the current WAIS mass contribution to sea level are relatively small (about 4 mm for the period 1992–2011) [Shepherd et al., 2012 ]; however, a full collapse could yield sea level rise (SLR) as great as 4.3 m [Church et al., 2013 ], exceeding projected steric SLR for the next five centuries [Church et al., 2013 ]. Given that the retreat of Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers may be slowed or reversed if basal melt rates are decreased [Favier et al., 2014 ], an important question is whether solar radiation management (SRM) may be able to delay or even prevent a WAIS collapse, as has been suggested [Blackstock et al., 2009 ].\nA large amount of mass loss from ice sheets occurs due to basal melt of the ice shelves [Joughin and Alley, 2011 ], the floating extensions of land ice sheets. In West Antarctica, the faces of these ice shelves extend from the surface to several hundred meters depth, near the level of the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), a subsurface water mass that is slightly warmer (−1°C to 1°C) [Yin et al., 2011] than waters above and below it. An increase in the temperature of CDW or in the rate that CDW is brought onto the continental shelf due to regional wind variability can greatly increase basal melting of ice shelves [Thoma et al., 2008; Joughin and Alley, 2011 ], causing ice shelf thinning. While the thinning of floating ice shelves does not in itself affect the sea level, the subsequent reduction in buttressing stress leads to an increase in ice stream velocity and ice mass loss, indirectly leading to global average SLR [Oppenheimer, 1998; Pritchard et al., 2012 ]. Thus, ice shelf disintegration and the subsequent SLR can happen even in the absence of large atmospheric warming [Oppenheimer, 1998 ].\nSRM has been shown to reduce the rate of global mean sea level rise. By examining observed relationships between sea level and volcanic eruptions, which temporarily lower sea level by briefly reducing ocean heat content [Church et al., 2005; Gleckler et al., 2006 ], Moore et al. [2010] argued that sulfate aerosol injections as SRM would reduce the rate of global mean sea level rise. Irvine et al. [2012] show that steric height changes in an intermediate complexity climate model are reduced by insolation reductions as SRM, and additionally include the contribution to sea level from the mass input of glaciers, icecaps, and Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets with a scaling to the global mean surface temperature anomaly. However, changes in oceanic circulation that can have significant impacts on basal melting of ice shelves [Steig et al., 2013; Joughin and Alley, 2011; Thoma et al., 2008] have not previously been considered.\nThe subsurface Southern Ocean temperature structure is strongly influenced by the surface wind stress [Fyfe et al., 2007; Spence et al., 2014 ], which in turn is set by the circumpolar westerly jet. McCusker et al. [2012] showed in a set of idealized simulations that when the global average temperature is stabilized using a stratospheric sulfate layer that counteracts growing CO 2 concentrations, an anomalous poleward intensified zonal wind stress on the Southern Ocean remains that causes upwelling of warmer subsurface waters to the level of ice sheet outlets. Warmed subsurface ocean waters that destabilize marine ice sheets may introduce threshold behavior in ice sheet mass loss [Notz, 2009] such that ice sheet loss, and hence SLR, becomes nonlinear with increased warming [Joughin et al., 2014 ].\nTo promptly avoid SLR in the face of rising greenhouse gases (GHGs), a large, rapid input of stratospheric aerosols would need to be deployed to reverse heat uptake by the ocean. Any delays in implementation would allow additional ocean heat storage that may linger at intermediate depths for centuries [Gillett et al., 2011 ]. SRM is most likely to be deployed only after a period of global warming that is deemed to be unacceptably large. Could a subsequent implementation of sulfate SRM preserve Antarctic ice sheets? Here we investigate with the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4) the impact of a rapidly increased stratospheric sulfate aerosol burden on atmospheric and oceanic circulation in the proximity of Antarctica. We contrast these results with an alternative management scenario in which GHGs are abruptly returned to preindustrial levels—the ultimate, if not impractical, climate engineering.\n2 Methods\nIn order to capture the relevant range of climate system time scales and dynamical feedbacks, we use the CCSM4 [Gent et al., 2011 ], a general circulation model (GCM) with a finite volume 0.9°×1.25° resolution atmosphere coupled to sea ice, land, and 1° full-depth ocean models. The ocean model is a constant volume model with reference salinity used to compute salinity changes from freshwater input. Glaciers and ice sheets are allowed up to 1 m of snow water equivalent to accumulate, and the rest is routed directly to the ocean. Given that there is very little melt on Antarctica presently, precipitation minus evaporation is approximately equal to runoff. In a warming scenario, however, the snowpack is allowed to melt if it becomes warm enough.\nSteric sea level change is computed as follows: ηn = H (( ρ 0/ρn) − 1), where ηn is the change in surface elevation at time step n, H is the global mean ocean depth, ρ 0 is the ‘baseline’ global mean ocean density from a twentieth century simulation (20thC) obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) averaged over 1970–1999, and ρn is global mean density at time step n. Ocean density, ρ, is primarily modified by changes in ocean temperature but is also affected by changes in salinity. This calculation assumes no volume change due to freshwater input (e.g., precipitation, evaporation, river runoff, melting, and freezing of sea ice).\nTwo simulations from NCAR are used as controls: the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 “business-as-usual” scenario, called the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 simulation (RCP8.5), reaching a radiative forcing from greenhouse gas emissions of 8.5 W/m 2 above preindustrial levels by 2100, and the twentieth century simulation (20thC) forced with historical greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions plus volcanic eruptions. The climate engineering simulations are branched from RCP8.5 at year 2035 when the global mean surface air temperature (SAT) is approximately 1°C greater than that of the end of 20thC average (computed for years 1970–1999). In year 2035, a prescribed stratospheric sulfate aerosol burden is commenced that is ramped up from zero at a rapid rate of increase. The scenario has 3 years of rapid ramping of total annual average sulfate (SO 4) burden at 8 teragrams of SO 4 per year (Tg/yr), followed by ramping of the burden at 0.67 Tg/yr for the remainder of the simulation (calculated to provide a roughly equal and opposite radiative forcing to RCP8.5).\nThe prescribed SO 4 burden, as in McCusker et al. [2012] and McCusker et al. [2014 ], is generated from output from simulations described in Rasch et al. [2008] wherein volcanically sized (0.05, 2.03, and 0.17 mm for dry mode radius, standard deviation, and effective radius, respectively) SO 2 was injected into the stratosphere over the tropics and allowed to circulate and oxidize to SO 4. In the present study, we prescribe an SO 4 burden rather than an SO 2 injection rate, so the particle size distribution is fixed. Given evidence that increasing injection rates may cause increased particle size and faster sedimentation rates [e.g., English et al., 2012 ], the radiative forcing achieved for a given burden may be overestimated in our simulations.\nWe conducted an ensemble of four sulfate engineering simulations, initialized from four RCP8.5 ensemble members. Throughout the paper, we refer to the ensemble average as “Sulf.” We contrast the sulfate engineering scenario with an idealized representation of complete mitigation and carbon sequestration by conducting one simulation, called GHGrem, in which anthropogenic greenhouse gases (CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O, and CFCs 11 and 12) are abruptly set to year 1850 levels in the year 2035. Unless otherwise noted, anomalies are presented as the departures of the average response (Sulf, GHGrem, and RCP8.5) in years 2045–2054 from the 1970–1999 average from 20thC.\n3 Sea Level Rise and Atmospheric Circulation\nDensity changes in our scenarios constitute the “steric” contribution to sea level rise (section 2 ). As CCSM4 (and most models of its class) lacks dynamical ice sheet behavior, and ice shelves and ice shelf cavities are absent, the contribution of mass input from the WAIS and other Antarctic ice sheets cannot be explicitly calculated. We, instead, focus on the large-scale oceanic temperature anomalies that determine melt rates near the ice shelves.\nThe time evolution of global mean surface air temperature (SAT) for RCP8.5 and climate engineering scenarios is shown in Figure  1 a. Sulf represents a scenario in which drastic climate engineering is required to stop sea levels from further rising, and hence entails a quick and large decrease in net radiative forcing via a rapid increase in stratospheric aerosol burden. This decrease in radiative forcing avoids a large amount of warming compared to business as usual (Figure  1 a; RCP8.5). The global and annual mean SAT linear trend for the first decade following the start of SRM (years 2035–2044) is −1.2°C/decade for the ensemble mean, and the land-only trend is even greater at −1.5°C/decade. One decade later (2045–2054), Sulf returns global mean SAT to roughly the end of 20thC (1970–1999), with a SAT anomaly of −0.03°C in Sulf compared to 1.83°C for RCP8.5. A second climate engineering scenario consisting of an instantaneous removal of GHGs to preindustrial conditions (GHGrem) gives a change in SAT that is broadly equivalent to that of Sulf for the same time period (−0.36°C).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer PowerPoint\nTime series of SAT and SLR. Global- mean annual-mean (a) surface air temperature (SAT; °C), and (b) steric sea level rise (SLR; cm) due to changes in ocean density, shown as anomalies from 20thC (1970–1999 average). The Sulf curve is an ensemble average. Light blue shading in Figure  1 a indicates the spread of the Sulf ensemble of simulations.\nGlobal average sea level due to changes in ocean density, in isolation of possible mass change from dynamical ice loss or exceptional melt (i.e., melt beyond 1 m of snow water equivalent; see section 2 ), reverses course and starts declining upon initiation of climate engineering (Figure  1 b). Nearly 30 cm of steric sea level rise is avoided by century's end when a sulfate layer is implemented, consistent with previous findings [Irvine et al., 2012 ]. The relatively long timescale of ocean heat uptake means that by 2095, the sea level in Sulf is still not fully equilibrated to the negative radiative forcing imposed by the increasing aerosols and thus, further sea level decline is in the pipeline. Nevertheless, a high rate of sulfate injection could promptly reduce or avoid a substantial amount of steric sea level rise, at the expense of potentially hazardous, large SAT trends. Removal of GHGs is equally effective at decreasing sea level. Next we consider whether changes in the distribution of ocean temperature might be poised to cause greater basal melt to marine ice shelves.\nNumerical simulations of SRM with stratospheric aerosols have shown residual SH poleward intensified winds induced by differences in the vertical temperature structure of a stratospheric sulfate layer versus well-mixed tropospheric carbon dioxide [Ammann et al., 2010; McCusker et al., 2012 ]. These temperature anomalies and corresponding upper atmosphere and surface wind changes share features with those induced by ozone depletion [Gillett and Thompson, 2003; Gillett et al., 2013; Sigmond et al., 2011; Thompson et al., 2011] and increasing greenhouse gases [Gillett et al., 2013; Sigmond et al., 2011; Polvani et al., 2011 ]. Although mechanisms and structural details differ somewhat depending on the type of upper atmospheric forcing, the fundamental cause is the same: the zonal wind shear in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere is increased due to an increase in the stratospheric pole-to-equator temperature gradient. Strengthened zonal winds then shift the jet poleward; however, what processes maintain the poleward-shifted jet is an open research question [Lorenz, 2014 ]. One study found that strengthened SH lower stratospheric/upper tropospheric winds increased eastward eddy propagation in the troposphere, which in turn shifts the critical latitude for Rossby wave breaking poleward, leading to poleward shifted surface westerlies [Chen and Held, 2007 ]. More recent studies using idealized models indicate that the poleward shift of strengthened zonal winds is maintained by the increased equatorward reflection of poleward propagating waves at a turning latitude, causing greater poleward momentum flux across the jet, shifting it poleward [Kidston and Vallis, 2012; Lorenz, 2014 ].\nWhen aerosol concentrations are quickly increased in the stratosphere, large temperature anomalies are generated in the upper troposphere and stratosphere (Figure  2 a). The zonal mean temperature structure with height is a combination of strong tropical lower stratospheric heating due to absorption of tropospheric long-wave radiation by aerosols [Ferraro et al., 2011] and high-latitude stratospheric long-wave cooling due to GHGs, with little change in the lower tropospheric temperature. The resultant zonal winds show a strengthened SH polar vortex and slight weakening of the subtropical jet (Figure  2 b).\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewer PowerPoint\nZonal average anomalies with height. Annual average, zonal average (a) temperature (°C), and (b) zonal wind (m/s) averaged from 2045–2054 in the Sulf ensemble minus the 1970–1999 average from 20thC. Hatching indicates statistical significance at the 90% level using the Student's t test for difference of two means.\nThe upper atmospheric deviations result in surface wind and wind stress anomalies in the SH that are comparable to those in RCP8.5: they are poleward shifted and intensified and have similar magnitudes (Figures  3 d, 3 e, and 4 a). In contrast, the surface wind stress is very nearly returned to 20thC values in GHGrem (Figures  3 f and 4 a). Additionally, while both climate engineering strategies cause the sea ice edge to recover to the 20thC position (20thC and climate engineering simulations show colocated 15% concentration contours in Figures  3 e– 3 f), annual average sea ice concentration near sea ice margins remains lower by up to 15% in Sulf, but are increased beyond 20thC concentrations by almost 10% in GHGrem (Figure S1 in the supporting information ). The residual sea ice concentration anomalies in Sulf and GHGrem are echoed in the residual temperature anomalies shown in Figure  3: Figure  3 b shows a weak local warming accompanying the reduced sea ice concentration in Sulf, while Figure  3 c shows weak local cooling where there are small increases in sea ice concentration in GHGrem.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewer PowerPoint\nSH SAT and zonal wind stress anomaly maps.

Contours indicate sea ice extent (15% concentration contour) for the 20thC (black) and perturbed simulation (gray); note that for Figures  3 e and 3 f the contours are nearly colocated. Hatching indicates statistical significance at the 90% level using the Student's t test for difference of two means.\n4 Implications for Antarctic Ice Sheets\nBoth climate engineering scenarios presented here in Sulf and GHGrem greatly reduce the surface warming over Antarctica that is seen in RCP8.5—greater than 100% in the case of GHGrem (compare Figures  3 b and 3 c with Figure  3 a)—but the ocean heat uptake that occurred over the first third of the 21st century before climate engineering was initiated also poses a threat to Antarctic ice sheets, particularly the WAIS, whose grounding line is below sea level [Joughin and Alley, 2011] and retreating [Rignot et al., 2014 ].\nSmall ocean temperature perturbations can have a significant impact on basal melting of ice shelves; a warming of just 0.1°C can thin 1 m of ice shelf in a year [Rignot and Jacobs, 2002 ]. Zonally averaged Southern Ocean temperature anomalies in Sulf indicate that temperatures encroaching on the ice shelves average 0.15–0.20°C warmer than 20thC (Figure  4 c). GHGrem, however, has zonal mean temperature near the level of ice shelves up to 0.25°C cooler than in Sulf (Figure  4 d). The ice sheet region in Antarctica most at-risk from basal melt is the Amundsen Sea Embayment sector including Pine Island Glacier (PIG). Critically, this region reveals an even greater potential for melting under sulfate climate engineering than in the zonal average: Sulf features an anomalous residual warming of 0.5°C in the 200–500 m layer (Figure  5 a). The enhanced residual warming in the PIG region compared to the zonal average is due to a steeper vertical temperature gradient in the 100–400 m layer. This, combined with slightly larger vertical velocity anomalies, which will be discussed next, is the primary reason for the larger temperature anomaly in the PIG region than in the zonal average. Extrapolating from Rignot and Jacobs [2002 ], this temperature anomaly represents a basal melt rate of 5 m/yr above 20thC. In contrast, GHGrem has a cooling of the subsurface ocean up to 0.5°C. As a point for comparison, a recent estimate of thickness rate of change from Pine Island over the period 1994–2012 is −23 ± 3.8 m/decade, which corresponds to a volume loss of −14 ± 2 km 3 /yr [Paolo et al., 2015 ]. Hence, our estimate of 5 m/yr (50 m/decade) from Sulf suggests that volume loss from PIG over the decade 2045–2054 would be approximately twice that seen over the past two decades (however, this assumes that volume loss has a linear relation to subsurface ocean temperature, which is unlikely [Joughin et al., 2014 ]).\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewer PowerPoint\nSouthern Ocean wind stress, wind stress curl, and potential temperature.

Gray shading in Figures  5 c and 5 e indicates anomalies that are greater than 1 standard deviation of the values in the 1970–1999 time series of the 20thC simulation.\nWe have not taken into account the basal meltwater changes from ice shelves, because they are not resolved in our model and the ocean response to such meltwater is uncertain. Underneath an ice shelf, rising meltwater may drive a sub-ice shelf circulation that increases the rate CDW reaches the ice shelf base [Jacobs et al., 2011 ]. Once meltwater exits the base of the ice shelf, it would likely rise and drive mixing near the shelf front. When the meltwater reaches the surface, it may also act to strengthen the halocline and inhibit the upwelling of heat at some distance away from the ice shelf. This would lead to the warming of waters at the depth that may circulate to the ice shelf base, potentially further enhancing basal melt.\nGHG removal is a more effective means for cooling subsurface ocean temperatures than stratospheric aerosol injection fundamentally because of changes in ocean circulation that are brought about by changes in atmospheric circulation. The anomalous middepth zonal average warmth evident south of about 65°S and between 200 and 400 m depth in Sulf (Figure  4 c) can be understood as anomalous upwelling of relatively warm CDW. This upwelling is caused by increased Ekman pumping that originates from the previously discussed poleward intensified zonal winds (Figures  3 e) caused by stratospheric aerosols, greenhouse gases [Fyfe et al., 2007 ], and their combination here (Figure  4 a). Engineering by sulfate aerosols features anomalous upwelling poleward of 60°S and downwelling equatorward of 60°S—just as in the RCP8.5 scenario (albeit with slightly smaller upwelling than in RCP8.5). In contrast, the removal of GHGs causes a reversal of sign in the zonal wind stress and wind stress curl anomalies compared to the anomalies associated with RCP8.5, resulting in weak anomalous downwelling south of 60°S (Figure  4 b), which results in the cooling of the 200–400 m layer past the twentieth century mean (Figure  4 d).\nIn the PIG region, the primary driver of the contrasting behavior between climate engineering methods is again due to differences in circulation. Vertical velocity responses of opposing signs (Figure  5 c) act on a climatological temperature gradient that features an increase in temperature with increasing depth in these layers (Figure  5 d). The result is that anomalous vertical advection warms the water column under sulfate engineering, although it is smaller than the business-as-usual scenario, whereas removal of GHGs causes a cooling, which is primarily due to the Eulerian component of vertical advection (Figure  5 e). The middepth residual warming resembles the “slow timescale” response to an increase in ozone forcing wherein the Southern Ocean circulation adjusts to changes in atmospheric winds and causes ocean warming from below that overcomes initial SST cooling and sea ice growth on the time scale of decades [Ferreira et al., 2014 ].\nFinally, although not germane to the stability of Antarctic ice sheets, it is interesting to note the disparate ocean temperature profiles in the full zonal average equatorward of 60°S between Sulf and GHGrem as well (Figures  4 c and 4 d). The warming evident equatorward of 60°S at all depths in Sulf is a combination of residual warmth from before climate engineering began, a poleward shift (fundamentally due to the atmospheric jet shift) of the nearly vertical climatological isotherms there, and increased downwelling of warmer surface waters. This feature is noticeably absent when GHGs are instead removed from the atmosphere because the jet rapidly returns to the 20thC position, resulting in weak upwelling anomalies equatorward of 60°S. Thus, the warming equatorward of 60°S is also due to the changes in the atmospheric winds due to the net forcing of increased GHGs and sulfate aerosols.\n5 Persistent and Problematic Circulation\nCirculation anomalies presented here result in a large-scale oceanic environment that would be favorable for further thinning of Antarctic ice shelves through basal melt, particularly in the region encompassing Antarctica's largest contributor to sea level rise [Shepherd et al., 2012 ], the already unstable Pine Island Glacier outlet [Rignot et al., 2014 ]. Fundamentally, these ocean circulation changes are due to the modified meridional temperature gradient in the stratosphere and upper troposphere induced by GHGs and sulfate aerosols. As a result, the ocean circulation changes responsible for warming of the water adjacent to the ice shelves persist for as long as GHGs and sulfates are in the atmosphere (Figures S2 and S3 ). Arguments that SRM with stratospheric aerosols is a “backstop” measure that could be rapidly deployed to avoid so-called climate emergencies, such as destabilization of marine ice sheets [Blackstock et al., 2009 ], are therefore not supported in this study. Given that the PIG grounding line is currently retreating along a retrograde bed, its reversibility may only be achievable with substantial reductions in basal melt rate beyond present-day rates [Favier et al., 2014 ]—a task only removal of GHGs can accomplish based on our results.\nWe emphasize that surface and subsurface ocean temperatures are undoubtedly cooler when stratospheric aerosols are in use than under business-as-usual warming. However, while general circulation models such as the one we employ do not resolve ice shelves and subscale processes that influence their thickness (e.g., small-scale mixing, tidal currents [Joughin and Alley, 2011 ]), we have determined that the subsurface Southern Ocean warmth, in proximity to ice shelves that remain after sulfate aerosol deployment, is fundamentally due to residual large-scale circulation changes. We suggest that quantitative calculations of changes in basal melt rates, changes in ice sheet dynamics, and associated sea level rise under various climate engineering techniques become a high priority once coupled GCM-ice-sheet models become available. The inability to stabilize the West Antarctic ice sheet must be added to the list of weaknesses of stratospheric sulfate aerosol injections [Robock, 2008, 2014 ], which already includes ozone depletion [Tilmes et al., 2008; Heckendorn et al., 2009 ], risk of extreme regional temperature trends upon cessation [Jones et al., 2013; McCusker et al., 2014 ], continued ocean acidification [Feely et al., 2004 ], and reduced precipitation [Bala et al., 2008 ].\nAcknowledgments\nThe global climate model can be obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (ncar.ucar.edu ).

Under the radical plan huge quantities of ocean water would be poured over the ice sheet and then converted into snow. This would stop the ice sheet melting creating a dramatic rise in sea levels across the world.\nTo reach this conclusion researchers increased snowfall on a 3D Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) computer programme, and believe they can mimic this with ocean water.\nDue to the amount of water required this could trigger a two to five-centimetre drop in sea levels.\nHowever researchers warn it would require an “unprecedented” engineering effort and could create a “substantial environmental hazard”.\nProfessor Anders Levermann, who co-authored the study, admitted there would be major tradeoffs associated with the plan.\nREAD MORE: Antarctica SHOCK - Melting glacier at TIPPING POINT threatens sea rise\nAntarctica shock: The plan would use 7,400 gigatons of artificial snow (Image: GETTY )\nSpeaking to The Daily Mail he said: “The fundamental tradeoff is whether we as humanity want to sacrifice Antarctica to save the currently inhabited coastal regions.\n“It is about global metropolises, from New York to Shanghai, which in the long term will be below sea level if nothing is done.\n“The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the tipping elements in our climate system.\n“Ice loss is accelerating and might not stop until the West Antarctic ice sheet is practically gone.”\nREAD MORE: Antarctica scientists make ‘astonishing’ find after drilling below ice\nAntarctica shock: The shock plan could cause sea levels to drop by two to five centimetres (Image: GETTY )\nThe melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet currently represents the biggest ice loss on the continent.\nTo complete the project 7,400 gigatons of artificial snow would be required over a ten year period.\nThis represents enough water to submerge the entirety of Great Britain to a depth of 30 meters.\nConsequently the University of Reading’s Dr Robin Smith warned the project would prove extremely challenging.\nHe told The Daily Mail that “although a large-scale geoengineering scheme is not utterly impossible, reducing greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible is clearly still the most reliable way to reduce the many harmful effects of climate change”.\nAntarctica SHOCK: Scientists have found a monstrous LAVA lake\nArctic nuclear submarine: Declassified Navy documents revealed\nAntarctica SHOCK: Melting glacier at TIPPING POINT threatens sea rise\nClimate change Antarctica"]}
{"query_id": "66", "generated_response": "Based on the search results, I can explain how ethical theories and professional codes influence organizational decision-making and why even ethical people sometimes make unethical choices.\n\n## Ethical Theories in Professional Decision-Making\n\n### Utilitarianism vs. Kantian Ethics\n\n**Utilitarianism** focuses on consequences - determining the right action by evaluating what produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number of people\" [2]. In organizational contexts, this might involve cost-benefit analysis of ethical decisions, considering long-term impacts on all stakeholders [8].\n\n**Kantian (Deontological) Ethics** emphasizes duty and moral principles that should be applied universally, regardless of consequences [2][7]. Kant's categorical imperative has two key rules:\n- Act only in ways you would want universalized for everyone\n- Treat people as ends in themselves, never merely as means [7][12]\n\n### Application in Leadership\n\nResearch shows that \"when faced with making a decision addressing an ethical dilemma, leaders prefer a particular ethical leadership style\" [5]. Leaders using different ethical frameworks approach problems differently - some focus on outcomes (utilitarian), while others emphasize adherence to principles regardless of results (Kantian) [6].\n\n## Professional Codes in Social Work and Teaching\n\n### Social Work Ethics\nThe NASW Code of Ethics requires social workers to:\n- Challenge social injustice and pursue social change\n- Promote general welfare from local to global levels\n- Facilitate informed public participation in shaping social policies\n- Engage in political action to ensure equal access to resources [10][14]\n\n### Teaching Ethics\nProfessional codes for educators emphasize:\n- Maintaining appropriate boundaries with students\n- Fair and accurate assessment practices\n- Professional conduct both inside and outside school\n- Avoiding conflicts of interest and maintaining integrity [4][15]\n\n## Why Ethical People Make Unethical Choices\n\nResearch identifies five key organizational factors that can lead ethical people to make unethical decisions [1][3]:\n\n### 1. Psychologically Unsafe Environment\nWhen employees fear speaking up, they may remain silent about ethical concerns. \"If a leader reacts with even the slightest bit of annoyance, they are signaling they don't really want to hear concerns\" [3].\n\n### 2. Unrealistic Performance Pressure\n\"Unfettered goal setting can encourage people to make compromising choices in order to reach targets, especially if those targets seem unrealistic\" [3]. This can lead to cutting corners or falsifying results.\n\n### 3. Conflicting Goals\nWhen organizations create competing objectives, employees may feel forced to compromise ethics. \"Once a sense of injustice is provoked, the stage is set for compromise\" [3].\n\n### 4. Inadequate Ethics Training\nMany organizations treat ethics as an annual compliance exercise rather than integrating ethical considerations into daily decision-making [3].\n\n### 5. Poor Leadership Examples\nLeaders who model inconsistent behavior or fail to demonstrate ethical standards can inadvertently signal that \"hypocrisy is ok\" [3].\n\n## Impact on Organizational Practices\n\n### Leadership Styles\nDifferent leadership approaches affect ethical climate:\n- **Coaching Leadership**: Promotes fairness and employee trust in raising ethical concerns [13]\n- **Autocratic Leadership**: Can quickly address serious ethical violations but may discourage reporting of subtle issues [13]\n- **Democratic Leadership**: Encourages collaborative approaches but may lead to indecision [13]\n\n### Hiring and Professional Development\nOrganizations increasingly recognize that \"ethical leaders are not born, they're made\" [13]. This has led to:\n- Integration of ethics training in professional development programs\n- Assessment tools to measure ethical leadership styles [5]\n- Recognition that ethical competence requires multiple pathways including legal, personal, interpersonal, organizational, and societal dimensions [8]\n\n### Personal vs. Professional Boundaries\nA significant challenge involves managing the boundary between personal and professional behavior. Research shows that teachers and other professionals sometimes struggle with social media use and maintaining appropriate relationships with students/clients [15]. Professional codes increasingly address these digital age challenges.\n\n## Organizational Culture Impact\n\nEthical leadership creates cascading effects throughout organizations. \"Ethics must begin at the top of an organization. It is a leadership issue and the chief executive must set the example\" [8]. This influences:\n\n- **Trust and Communication**: Ethical climates encourage open reporting of concerns\n- **Decision-Making Processes**: Integration of ethical considerations into routine decisions\n- **Professional Identity**: How individuals see themselves within their professional roles\n\nThe key insight is that ethical behavior in organizations isn't just about individual character - it's significantly influenced by systemic factors, organizational culture, and leadership practices that either support or undermine ethical decision-making.", "citations": ["https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/business-and-economy/2016-12-20-five-reasons-why-ethical-people-make-unethical-choices/", "https://kevinhub.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/an-overview-of-traditional-ethical-theories/\n", "https://hbr.org/2016/12/why-ethical-people-make-unethical-choices\n", "https://edufixers.com/personal-and-professional-ethics/", "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jls.21523", "https://myassignmenthelp.com/free-samples/leadership-ethics-and-decision-making", "https://josephsononbusinessethics.com/2010/10/decision-making-models-kants-categorical-imperative/\n", "https://www.workplaceethicsadvice.com/2021/08/the-role-of-ethical-leadership-in-organizational-culture.html", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320481335_Ethical_Leadership_Style_and_Its_Impact_on_Decision-Making", "https://www.socialworkers.org/About/Ethics/Ethics-Education-and-Resources/Social-Justice-Ethics-Resources\n", "https://www.solutionessays.com/social-work-ethics-and-nasw-codes/", "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kantian-ethics-leadership-johan-oostlander", "https://study.com/academy/lesson/leadership-style-its-impact-on-ethics-in-organization.html\n", "https://fieldinstructortraining.iu.edu/policy-training-for-field-instructors/professional-expectations-for-social-worker-engagement-in-policy-practice/the-nasw-code-of-ethics.php", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257246028_How_do_teachers_make_judgments_about_ethical_and_unethical_behaviors_Toward_the_development_of_a_code_of_conduct_for_teachers", "https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-74078-2_47-1"], "contexts": ["Five reasons why ethical people make unethical choices\nBusiness\nFive reasons why ethical people make unethical choices\nB L Premium\n20 December 2016 - 10:15 Harvard Business Review\nDespite good intentions, organisations set themselves up for ethical catastrophes by creating environments in which people feel forced to make choices they could never have imagined.\nHere are five ways organisations needlessly provoke good people to make unethical choices.\n1.

The most recent National Business Ethics Survey indicates progress as leaders make concerted efforts to pay holistic attention to their organization’s systems. But despite progress, 41% of workers reported seeing ethical misconduct in the previous 12 months, and 10% felt organizational pressure to compromise ethical standards. Wells Fargo’s recent debacle cost them $185 million in fines because 5300 employees opened up more than a million fraudulent accounts.  When all is said and done, we’ll likely learn that the choices of those employees resulted from deeply systemic issues.\nCreating an Ethical Workplace\nWhy It’s So Hard to Train Someone to Make an Ethical Decision\nEugene Soltes\nKeep a List of Unethical Things You’ll Never Do\nMark Chussil\nDon’t Try to Be the “Fun Boss” — and Other Lessons in Ethical Leadership\nKimberly Nei and Darin Nei\nDespite good intentions, organizations set themselves up for ethical catastrophes by creating environments in which people feel forced to make choices they could never have imagined.  Former Federal Prosecutor Serina Vash says, “When I first began prosecuting corruption, I expected to walk into rooms and find the vilest people.  I was shocked to find ordinarily good people I could well have had coffee with that morning. And they were still good people who’d made terrible choices.”\nHere are five ways organizations needlessly provoke good people to make unethical choices.\nIt is psychologically unsafe to speak up. Despite saying things like, “I have an open door policy,” some leadership actions may inhibit the courage needed to raise ethical concerns.  Creating a culture in which people freely speak up is vital to ensuring people don’t collude with, or incite, misconduct.  Elizabeth Morrison of New York University, in Encouraging a Speak Up Culture, says “You have to confront the two fundamental challenges preventing employees from speaking up.  The first is the natural feeling of futility — feeling like speaking up isn’t worth the effort or that on one wants to hear it.  The second is the natural fear that speaking up will lead to retribution or harsh reactions.” A manager’s reactions to an employee’s concerns sets the tone for whether or not people will raise future issues.  If a leader reacts with even the slightest bit of annoyance, they are signaling they don’t really want to hear concerns.\nThere is excessive pressure to reach unrealistic performance targets. Significant research from Harvard Business School suggests unfettered goal setting can encourage people to make compromising choices in order to reach targets, especially if those targets seem unrealistic. Leaders may be inviting people to cheat in two ways.  They will cut corners on the way they reach a goal, or they will lie when reporting how much of the goal they actually achieved.  Says Lisa Ordonez, Vice Dean and professor at the University of Arizona, “Goals have a strong effect of causing tunnel vision, narrowly focusing people at the expense of seeing much else around them, including the potential consequences of compromised choices made to reach goals.”  Once people sense the risk of failure, they go into “loss prevention” mode, fearing the loss of job, status, or at-risk incentives. The Veterans Administration learned this lesson the hard way when trying to address the 115-day wait time in their Phoenix hospital. They set a new goal of reducing the wait to 14 days, which resulted in an alleged 24-day wait. But employees said they felt compelled to manipulate performance records to give the appearance of meeting these goals. As many as 40 veterans died waiting for care at the Phoenix center, some more than a year. Organizations must ensure people have the resources, timelines, skill and support they need to achieve targets they are given, especially ambitious stretch goals.\nConflicting goals provoke a sense of unfairness. And once a sense of injustice is provoked, the stage is set for compromise.  Maureen Ambrose, Mark Seabright, and Marshall Schminke’s research on organizational injustice clearly shows a direct correlation between employees’ sense of fairness and their conscious choice to sabotage the organization.  Consider one organization I worked with whose pursuit of growth created conflicting goals. The head of Supply Chain was given a $3.5 million capital investment to overhaul a plant to triple its production. Some of that funding came from the 25% budget cut in marketing in the same division.  At the same time, Sales divided its quota territories to raise topline performance. The intensity of resentment in the salesforce at having to drive revenues with smaller territories was compounded by having fewer marketing dollars to sell more product. The conflicting goals created excess product capacity that was bottlenecked getting to market.  Two years later, the organization was indicted for channel stuffing.\nToo many leaders assume that talking about ethics is something you do when there’s been a scandal, or as part of an organization’s compliance program.  Everyone gets their annual “ethics flu shot” in the mandatory review of the compliance policy, and all is well for another year. Nick Eply, professor at the University of Chicago, in Four Myths about Morality and Business, says, “It’s a myth to think ‘Everyone is different and everything is relative.’ You actually have to teach people the relative value of principles relative to choices.”  Leaders have to infuse everyday activities with ethical considerations and design policies and norms that keep ethics top of mind.  Jonathan Haidt, Professor of Business Ethics at NYU and founder of says, “It’s important to talk about the positive examples of ethical behavior, not just the bad ones.  Focusing on the positive reasons you are in business, and reinforcing the good things people do strengthens ethical choices as ‘the norm’ of the organization.”\nA positive example isn’t being set. Leaders must accept they are held to higher standards than others.  They must be extra vigilant about not just their intentions, but how it is others might interpret their behavior. While they can’t control every possible misinterpretation, leaders who know their people well make careful choices in how they react to stressful situations, confront poor performance, how politic they are in the face of controversy, and how receptive they are to bad news.  Above all, even in what might be considered the smallest “white lie,” ethical leaders are careful not to signal that hypocrisy is ok.  As an example, a leader may casually review an employee’s presentation and provide feedback like, “I think we need to take these two slides out — that data is inflammatory and we don’t want to derail the ultimate outcome which is to convince the budget committee to give us the resources we want.”  While the leader might presume he has acted in the best interest of the group — going to bat for resources they need- the person building the presentation has just been told, “We can’t tell the entire truth because it could prevent us from getting what we want.”  Leaders must put themselves in the shoes of those they lead to see what unintended messages they may be sending.\nOrganizations who don’t want to find themselves on a front-page scandal must scrutinize their actions to far greater degrees than they may have realized.  In an age of corporate mistrust, creating ethical workplaces takes more than compliance programs.  It requires ongoing intensified effort to make the highest ethical standards the norm, and ruthless intolerance of anything less.\nRon Carucci is co-founder and managing partner at Navalent, working with CEOs and executives pursuing transformational change.

The paper must be methodologically pragmatic, have a clear articulation, and must have an organized structure that contains the major points based on the topic of an investigation. Moreover, scientific research articles must have sufficient background about a topic, must show how it relates appropriately to its audience, and must have a logical flow that illustrates the main arguments. The intention of this essay is to examine a research journal article to examine whether it meets the methodological standards needed in a research article.\nSummary: Main Points Discussed in the Article\nResearch Background or Introduction\nThe paper discusses the professional ethics of practice and the manner in which workers in social work perceive these ethics (Osmo & Landau, 2006). The research specifically intended to examine how social workers perceive different ethical principles articulated in different ethics theories in their daily social work practices. The researchers, Osmo and Landau (2006), sought to examine the relationship between the prevailing ethical theories, the existing ethical dilemmas, and the increase in ethical issues, the idea of ethical decision-making, and the existing problems in the perceived ethical principles.\nIn the introduction, the article concentrates on elaborating about the manner in which the professional values of the social workers are associated with societal values. The authors, Osmo and Landau (2006), further emphasizes unraveling the prevailing confusion between the professional values of the social workers and most importantly how the social workers perceive their personal philosophies with the hierarchies of personal and professional ethics. The background also provides rich information about the influence of the deontological theories and the technological theories on the decision-making behaviors of social workers.\nTo expound on the existing ethical dilemmas, the researchers, Osmo and Landau (2006), argue that social workers still lack knowledge on how to choose their ethical decisions, or even justify their prioritized decisions about ethical dilemmas and what actions make-up a sufficient ethical framework. In the background, Osmo and Landau (2006) argued that social workers have varied perceptions concerning the utilitarian theory, the deontological theory, the rights theory, the virtue theory, and the ethics of care theory. The researchers noted that different social workers have different preferences concerning the five ethical principles.\nThe Research Methodology\nIn this section, the researchers presented a methodological section that comprised an explanation of the research procedure, the data collection instruments, sample selection, and the analysis approach used in the study. The researchers explained the research procedure by revealing its sample population that comprised 62 Israeli social workers as the research respondents. The researchers, Osmo and Landau (2006) presented information on how they a rich-content questionnaire made up of 12 ethical principles following the NASW Code of Ethics of 1996 and the IASW Code of Ethics of 1994.\nThe above code of ethics formed a pillar for the social worker’s codes of ethics. In the methodology section, Osmo and Landau (2006) discussed how they used a structured questionnaire of 12 ethical principles as their main data instrument. In the questionnaire, some social case scenarios appeared as constructs to analyze the arguments of the social workers pertaining to ethical principles and the manner they should apply in practice from both an individual and a professional perspective. With a response rate of 50% that represented 62 respondents, Osmo and Landau (2006) described how they used content analysis to analyze data.\nResearch Results, Discussion, and Implications\nIn their results, Osmo and Landau (2006) noted that when the social workers ranked the use of ethical theories in four different contexts of social construct, their opinions and perceptions varied significantly between the five aforementioned ethical theories. In their discussion, Osmo and Landau (2006) discovered that social workers use deontological theories such as the theory of universalism, the right intention theory, and the duty theory of ethics to justify their preferences towards certain ethical principles. Concerning the implications, whereas the study suggested that ethical theories help in understanding ethical dilemmas, a small sample of 62 could not prove this ideology.\nWhy the article cannot be a Reliable or a Valid Source\nThe research may not be a reliable or valid source of information. The first problem with the research is that the background provides different forms of literature arguments that later do not match with the desired result discussions. The second issue is that the methodology is straightforward, but the constructs and components of the questionnaire seem to confuse the readers and divert them from the research aim. The results provided by the research are not in line with the supposed aim established at the beginning of the research. This approach means that the research was manipulative and full of careless triangulation of data.\nConclusion\nA published research article, whether from a valid publisher or just from an unknown source, can be very unreliable and invalid for referencing. An article is only valid and reliable when; apart from following the legitimate publication protocols, it ensures that the written content is methodologically correct, and with relevant information that is sufficient to authenticate from the research background to the end.\nIn their article, Osmo and Landau (2006) presented an article with a mixed-up concept, an illogic flow of content, and with an unclear aim that misdirected the research.\nReference\nOsmo, J., & Landau, R.

These instruments have primarily focused on followers’ evaluation of ethical leadership attributes of their leaders. Often leaders find themselves faced with making challenging ethical decisions. In the current article, we present a validated leadership self-assessment tool that measures leader’s preferred ethical leadership style. The current article concludes that, when faced with making a decision addressing an ethical dilemma, leaders prefer a particular ethical leadership style. Knowledge of ethical leadership style is beneficial for leaders to understand the process they utilize when faced with difficult choices. This tool may be useful in developing and educating leaders, teams, and organizations to make better decisions, thereby reducing incidents of poor ethical choices.\nCiting Literature", "Leadership - Ethics And Decision Making And ethical Management\nFree Samples Leadership, Ethics And Decision Making\nLeadership, Ethics And Decision Making\n155 Downloads 11 Pages / 2,541 Words\nQuestion:\nEffective leadership, decision-making and ethical management are linked both in theory and in practice. How may leaders ensure organizational decisions are made ethically?\nAnswer:\nIntroduction\nEffective Leadership is the primary force that leads to the development of an ethical culture and reinforcement of ethical decision making (Ferrell, Fraedrich, & Ferrell, 2014). Leadership refers to the inherent ability to direct and guide others towards a goal. Leadership is the process of developing ideas and vision, living by values that support those visions, using the inherent charisma to influence others to live by those values and possess the capabilities of making tough decision as and when required. Effective leadership helps organisations in creating a vision which acts as foundation for organisational values. Ethical decision making is a key aspect of effective leadership along with their ability to motivate others to achieve goals.\nEthics is also called as moral philosophy that involves systematizing, defending and recommending concepts of right and wrong behaviour (Fisher & Lovell, 2006). It is important to ensure that all professionals abide by the coded of ethics. Ethical leadership leads to the creation of an ethical culture that is serves as a base for ethical decision-making.\nThis assignment conducts and in-depth analysis of two case studies related to two great leaders Steve Jobs and Allen Mullaly. It analyses the leadership style, ethical management and decision making skills of the two great leaders who were the reason behind the remarkable success witnessed by their respective organisations. Both of them display a very different personality however their inherit charisma and a passion for innovation and success got them worldwide recognition.\nCase Study 1: Steve Jobs at Apple\nSteve Jobs has always been listed as one of the world’s most successful leaders who have had a considerable impact on the society and have redefined the business terms in a way that supported their actions (Adair, 2009). Steve Jobs was the Chairman and CEO of Apple Computers Inc. which he founded in year 1976 in his parent’s garage (Hellriegel & John W. Slocum, 2011). He was forced to leave his position as a CEO in 1985 owing to his personality clashes with others however soon he was called back to assume his position and today is remembered as one of the world’s most successful CEO’s. Steve Jobs without doubt is the key force behind the extraordinary success witnessed by his company. He is recognised worldwide for his leadership style, ethical management and tough decision making.\nSteve Jobs presents a perfect example of transformational leadership wherein the leader is expected to anticipate future trends, create a new vision of possibilities, inspire followers in a way that they understand and embrace the created vision, provides ample opportunities so that followers can acquire leadership qualities and become better leaders and developing a organisation into a community of rewarded and challenged learners (Bertocci, 2009). Innovation is the main force behind the success of transformational leaders like Steve Jobs. They are ready to take risks in order to drive change. Steve Jobs is an example of born leaders who possess the inherit charisma to influence others and make things work according to their ways.\nSteve Jobs displayed the use of autocratic leadership style wherein the leaders makes his own rules and others are expected to follow his directions without questions (Armstrong & Stephens, 2005). Autocratic leaders are task oriented and consider employees as machines who are used to get work done (Avery & Bergsteiner, 2011). Steve Jobs never looked for inputs from his subordinates; they may be geniuses of bozos but were all indispensible or not relevant in his presence. Use of this leadership style is very helpful in running the businesses in a much organised manner and employees tend to perform better in presence of their leader (Bass & Bass, 2009). However the main disadvantage behind this style is that employees lose their creativity and become completely dependent on leaders ideas. Productivity of such organisation falls considerably when the leader is not present (Bertocci, 2009). Steve Jobs is a controversial leader and would publicly call his competitors evil, mediocre and lacking taste. Steve Jobs was a very persistent leader who believed that innovation is the key to effective leadership.\nEthical leaders possess seven core habits that make them different from others namely; they possess strong personal character, have a passion to do what is right, they are very proactive, they consider interests of all stakeholders, they serve as a model for the organisation’s values, they believe in transparency and are actively involved in decision making and they develop a holistic view of organisation’s ethical culture (Keen, 2012). Deontology theory of ethics describes Steve Jobs ways of ethical management. According to the deontology theory individuals must adhere to obligations and duties when they analyse an ethical dilemma (Weiss, 2008). Steve Jobs was a persistent leader and this is clear from the fact that he even left his position to stick to his values. Steve Jobs is compared to the Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky because he had such a pure vision that he was unable to accommodate the imperfections existing in the world (Hellriegel & John W. Slocum, 2011). A number of incidents have been reported wherein Steve Jobs had terminated employees irrespective of their position when they failed to adhere to their duties and company policies. Culture at Apple Computers is described as power culture where ever issue was viewed from a deontological perspective. Steve Jobs displayed strong personal character, was proactive and had a passion to do what is right and he supported transparency as all information was well communicated to employee however their views was given no preference.\nSteve Jobs is one of the best examples of an effective leader with strong ethical management and decision making skills. He has made a number of tough decisions when he was CEO and Chairman of Apple Computers Inc. Some of his decisions were really impressive and has enabled Apple Computers achieve their desired goals; however like every other humans some of his decision were not that impressive and effective. For example his decision to hire John Sculley to succeed himself as CEO of the company was his biggest mistake and resulted in period of slow growth and many product missteps. Steve Jobs decision processes and style matched to that of a micro-manager especially in case of product design decisions (Daft, 2007). With his autocratic leadership style Steve Jobs was called a corporate dictator who took all decisions by himself. There have been cases when during his angry tantrums he fired his subordinates without even giving a second thought over it. Even on personal front Steve Jobs was seen as a stubborn decision maker who wants things to work according his ways. In year 2003 when he was detected with abdominal cancer he choose to go for treatment with a special diet and explored a number of alternatives before actually surrendering for a surgery when things were going out of control. He lived his whole life as a risk takers, innovator and attitude for a born leader.\nCase Study: Alan Mullaly, CEO, Ford Motor Company\nAlan Mullaly was the CEO of Ford Motor Company and was the key driving force behind the remarkable turnaround of Ford without seeking U.S government financial aid. When Alan Mullaly joined as the CEO of Ford the company was on the verge of financial crisis and was almost about to lose its independence (Hellriegel & John W. Slocum, Organizational Behaviour, 2011). Under the effective leadership of Alan Mullaly Ford Motor not only managed to come over the financial crisis but also capture a huge market share of automobile industry. Alan Mullaly created an organisation culture that served as a competitive advantage against the rivals.\nAlan Mullaly presents a perfect example of transactional leadership wherein the leader motivates and directs his followers primarily by appealing to their own self-interest (Bass & Bass, 2009). Transactional leadership emphasizes on the carrot approach wherein performance objectives and goals are effectively communicated to employees and regular feedbacks are provided to them. Alan Mullaly displayed the use of participative leadership style wherein employees were encouraged to actively participate in decision making process and openly share their views             (Borins, 2002). He emphasized on openness and effective communication. He ensured that everyone in the organization is aware of the plan, its status and areas that needed more attention. He possessed the inherit charisma and high positive energy that enabled him to influence his followers. He was greatly appreciated by his followers for his openness that won him large support within the organisation. He had effective team building skills that helped him integrate the company into single global entity (Hellriegel & John W. Slocum, Organisational Behaviour, 2011). Alan Mullaly created a clear vision and values for the company that were effectively communicated to employees and they very influence by his positive energy to live by the values that support his vision. He motivated his employees to strive for functional and technical excellence, work as a team in close coordination with each other, live by ford values and deliver results that met customer expectations. As an effective leader Alan Mullaly believed in communicating inspiring vision, informing others about the values that support the vision, be a role model who lived by those values, think win-win, bring everyone on the same page, always carry a can-do attitude and be result oriented.\nAlan Mullaly displayed all the characteristics of an ethical leader, he possessed strong personal character, he was confident, discipline and a fierce desire to win, he had a desire to do what is right, was proactive and considered interest of all stakeholders (Ferrell, Fraedrich, & Ferrell, 2014). His ethical management can be best explained by utilitarian ethical theory according to which an action is viewed as right or wrong based on its consequence (Fisher & Lovell, 2006). The choice that offers greatest benefit for most of the people is considered the most ethical choice. The development of One Ford model holds true for the fact that Alan Mullaly was a people-oriented leader who respected the rights of his people. He ensured that all the policies and code of conducts of the company are followed rigorously. He provided ample opportunity to his subordinates and employee to realise their full potential and actively participate in decision making. He viewed all employees as members of one team, who had to follow one plan in order to achieve one common goal.\nAlan Mullaly is recognised worldwide for his strong decision making and problem solving skills. It was his decisions that helped Ford Motor Company in overcoming a financial crisis and slowly win over their competitors. It was his decision to borrow $23 billion against Ford assets in order to ensure that Ford’s independence is secured. He was the one who suggested Bill Ford to sell Land Rover and Jaguar so that they can focus their resources on Ford brand. It was owing to his strong decision making skills that Taurus is back to showrooms and is one of the best selling products of Ford today. Alan Mullaly believed in effective communication being the key to successful change management and through his openness he was able to win huge support throughout the organization. Owing to his participative leadership style he concerned inputs provided by employees before making any decisions. He was concerned for all stakeholders thus ensured that high decision support interest of all. He decided the Ford will work as a single integrated team thus developed the One Ford Model which is recognised worldwide for its effective results. One Ford Model is studied as a best practice around the world and is used by many other companies to streamline operation and build effective teams so that they can achieve desired organisational goals, develop and retain their competitive advantage (Hellriegel & John W. Slocum, Organisational Behaviour, 2011). Effective decision making is an essential skill that helps differentiating ethical leaders from other leaders and managers. Effective leadership, ethical management and tough decision making as and when required has helped Alan Mullaly develop an organisational culture where employees enjoy coming every day. His inspiring spirit and positive attitude motivated employees to take the ownership of task assigned to them and work in coordination to achieve common goals.\nConclusion\nEthical decision making and effective leadership goes hand in hand because leaders have the needed skills and expertise to motivate others and enforce policies, norms and view points within the organisation. It is the prime responsibility of ethical leaders like Steve Jobs and Alan Mullaly to ensure that organisational goals and performance objectives are met in an ethical manner. It is seen that ethical leaders as those discussed in the assignment are found to have employees that look at them as role model rather than deviants that create problems within the organisation.\nSteve Jobs is an excellent example of transformational leader whose creativity and innovative ideas for the base for exceptionally high growth of Apple Inc. However at times he is seen as an autocratic leader who wants people to work according his ways. He preferred making important decision by himself without consider inputs given by employees. Whatever may be the consequences of his decisions he never repented. Allan Mullaly on the other hand through his participative leadership style and a people-oriented approach has enabled Ford Motor Corporation achieve their desired goals and become one of the world’s largest automobile companies. His inherit charisma and a strong sense of ethics has helped him keep his followers motivated during tough times.\nDevelopment of ethical leadership skills need years of experience, training and learning through various best practices of leadership. Steve Jobs and Allan Mullaly have acquired ethical leadership skills through years of hard work, dedication and a passion to create a difference.\nReferences\nAdair, J. (2009).

Kant’s rigid theory gives us no way to choose between ethical values.\nBusiness Ethics Decision Making ethics training ethics training resourcesleadership training Making Ethical Decisions professional developmentresources Risk Management team building training", "The Role of Ethical Leadership in Organizational Culture - Workplace Ethics Advice\nThe Role of Ethical Leadership in Organizational Culture\n08/25/2021\nWhat Are the Qualities of an Ethical, Competent Leader?\nWhen we think about ethical leadership, the first thing that comes to mind is: What is Ethics? Simply stated, ethics is about knowing what the right thing to do is in a variety of circumstances and carrying out ethical intent with ethical behavior. This is, of course, easier said than done.\nDoing the Right Thing\nHow do we determine what the right thing to do is? Short of making this blog a treatise on philosophy, let me just say there are a variety of perspectives in answering the question. These are described below.\nUtilitarianism: This is a cost-benefit analysis of ethical issues by evaluating the costs to take some action that produces an ethical result versus the harms that might come to others by doing so. For example, a leader may be tasked with selecting a method of accounting for revenue. An ethical leader should follow the rules, thinking more harms would come to the organization if they were caught violating accounting rules than might be gained by inappropriately inflating revenue. Ethical leaders must think in the long run when making decisions. There may be a benefit each year by manipulating results (i.e., higher stock price) but manipulating revenues over time catches up to the organization because each year the pressure builds to maintain the falsehood.\nRights Theory. Under Rights Theory, also known as Kantian Rights, an ethical leader would make decisions that emphasize the rights of users of financial statements to receive accurate and reliable financial information to support decision-making.  One way to determine rightness is ask: “How would I want others to decide what is right in a similar situation for similar reasons.” Ethical leaders realize that if everyone falsified earnings then the financial statement numbers would be meaningless. Beyond that, each entity would look for more and more ways to beat the system to keep up with the competition.\nJustice: Justice is often thought of in terms of “fairness.” Treating others fairly means to treat them based on their actions, not a preconceived notion about them which may be tainted by race, religion, sexual preference and so on. An ethical leader would treat employees fairly: reward them based on results. In accounting, fairness means to present financial information in accordance with the rules and achieving a fair representation of the financial results; one the stakeholders can rely on.\nQualities of an Ethical Leader\nEthical leaders are honest, trustworthy, fair-minded, responsible, accountable, and have integrity. Integrity is the foundation of an ethical person in general, and a leader should be held to the same standard. Integrity means different things in different contexts. It can mean courage when addressing doing the right thing even when pressures exist to do otherwise. Ethical leaders would have the courage of their convictions to not go along with falsified financial information.\nMoving on, Martin Luenendonk addresses “The Qualities of an Ethical Leader.” He describes a variety of core characteristics of ethical leaders including conscientiousness, inclusive, accountable, considerate, consistent, and authoritative. Notice these are behavioral factors that define good leadership and they enhance communication and understanding in an organization. Leaders that incorporate these values into their decision-making build trust with employees, the key to having an ethical organization.\nEthical Leadership Competence\nEthical Leadership Competence refers to the ability to handle all kinds of moral problems that may arise in an organization. It means to develop the problem-solving and decision-making skills to make difficult decisions. Leaders might try to deal with a moral problem in an automatic way, essentially using their authority for the basis of decision making. However, as I discussed in another blog, this System 1 approach is fraught with danger because the interests of all stakeholders may not be adequately considered, subtle moral issues may go unnoticed, and expediency is emphasized instead of thought and deliberation. What is needed is to develop the competency to reason through ethical conflicts in a systematic way, or a System 2 approach to decision-making. There is no shortcut to making ethical decisions. It requires judgment and reflection on what the right thing to do is.\nPathways to Ethical Leadership\nLinda Fisher Thornton originally identified five levels of ethical competence: personal, interpersonal, organizational, professional, and societal. More recently, she described 11 paths to \"Ethical Leadership Competence.\" She believes leaders need to develop all eleven paths to be considered ethical leaders. These paths are described as follows.\nLegal.\nFollowing all laws and regulations in one's industry and geographical area.\nPersonal.\nPersonal awareness of good leadership skills and good moral character.\nInterpersonal.\nTreating people with respect and caring and respecting differences.\nOrganizational.\nFollowing internal codes of behavior and organizational expectations.\nProfessional.\nFollowing the ethics code in one's industry or profession.\nCulture Building.\nBuilding a high-trust culture through ethical leadership.\nC ontextual.\nBeing morally aware and motivated to act rightly towards others and finding beneficial solutions to ethical problems.\nS ocietal.\nImproving the lives of others and their communities.\nEnvironmental.\nProtecting the planet for future generations.\nGlobal.\nThinking on a global scale and acting as a responsible citizen.\nEthical leaders that follow these pathways are developing leadership competence.\nIn conclusion, Edward Hennessy, the Chairman and CEO for the Allied Signal, Inc., is quoted as saying: Ethics must begin at the top of an organization. It is a leadership issue and the chief executive must set the example.” In other words, as I have been preaching on my “Workplace Ethics Advice” blog for many years, an ethical organization starts with an ethical leader who sets an ethical tone at the top and fosters ethical behavior in all organizational systems and in all interrelationships, including with employees, suppliers, customers, the government, and the community at large.\nPosted by Dr. Steven Mintz, The Ethics Sage, on August 25, 2021.

Baehrend\nAbstract\nThe ethical failures of organizational leaders have led to the development of instruments seeking to measure ethical leadership. These instruments have primarily focused on followers’ evaluation of ethical leadership attributes of their leaders. Often leaders find themselves faced with making challenging ethical decisions. In the current article, we present a validated leadership self-assessment tool that measures leader’s preferred ethical leadership style. The current article concludes that, when faced with making a decision addressing an ethical dilemma, leaders prefer a particular ethical leadership style. Knowledge of ethical leadership style is beneficial for leaders to understand the process they utilize when faced with difficult choices. This tool may be useful in developing and educating leaders, teams, and organizations to make better decisions, thereby reducing incidents of poor ethical choices.\nContent uploaded by Michael Chikeleze\nAuthor content\nContent may be subject to copyright.\n... This finding may conclude that the school leaders realize the importance of ethi cal leadership on the decision-making process to confront critical issues and dilemmas facing schools. This finding is compatible with the finding of Chikeleze & Baehrend (2017), who found that the leaders prefer a particular ethical leadership behavior, w hen they intend to make decisions on ethical issues. Also, this finding is consistent with the finding of Ozan, Ozdemir and Yirci (2017), who reported that the class teachers' opinions were positive regarding the ethical leadership practices of school leaders to make decisions.  ...\n... Many procedures and stages in the decision making process require school leaders to have knowledge in management as well as skills and competencies in leadership to function as ethical leaders.

One element of NASW codes that is part of this assignment is the Code of Ethics that dictates the behavior of social workers. DiFranks (2008) explains that the NASW Code of Ethics contains principles, values, and standards that are essential for all social workers. Academic integrity is covered by the NASW Code of Ethics in varying sections: 4.08 Acknowledging Credit, 4.06 Misrepresentation, and 4.04 Dishonesty, Fraud, and Deception.\nSocial work codes explore on scholastic performance and professional behaviors of academic performance. According to the NASW Code of Ethics, academic integrity is defined as the processes of teaching, research, and academic responsibilities like ethical, responsible and honest. All social work schools in the United States are required to have policies to be followed by students (NASW, 2008). This is provided during the letter of admission where a student is required to indicate their adherence to the Code of Ethics.\nDon't use plagiarized sources. Get Your Custom Essay on\nSocial Work Ethics and NASW Codes\nJust from $13/Page\nOrder Essay\nExample of lack of academic integrity according to NASW Code of Ethics includes misrepresenting, lying, cheating and plagiarism of research. One principle of the code is that social workers should take credit and responsibility exclusively on researches they have conducted or are part through authorship credit (NASW, 2017). The code also requires the authors to acknowledge the contributions and the work of other scholars. For each, time that a social worker professional writes an assignment or a paper, they are required to provide appropriate citations that reveal sections that are not their original ideas.\nAcademic dishonesty is one part of academic integrity and academic dishonesty may include the use of unauthorized assistance in taking examinations, tests or quizzes. The second form of academic dishonesty is the reliance of unauthorized resources while conducting an assignment, writing a report, solving problems or writing researches. Besides, it is academic dishonesty for a student to possess without permission academic materials that belong to other students or staff. Plagiarism is one of the most debated forms of academic dishonesty where a student uses quotations or paraphrases of other works without proper crediting the author with bibliographical references, citations, or footnotes (Walden University, 2017). Another form of academic dishonesty is a falsification of official documents including attendance records.\nThe aspect of plagiarism is represented in section 4.08 of the NASW Code of Ethics which requires a social worker to take credit and responsibility as well as authorship credit of their work. The social work requires all students to abide by the NASW Code of Ethics where students understand the concept of plagiarism and avoid plagiarism by maintaining academic as well as individual honesty on their academic work (NASW, 2008).  For example, it is misapprehended and fraudulent to copy information and present as one’s work.\nDiFranks (2008) explains that the Code of Ethics provides social workers with approaches to self-analyze and be an example to their clients. The NASW (2008) provides that the “Social Workers should not participate in, condone, or be associated with dishonesty, fraud or deception” in section 4. This section is an illustration that social workers are committed towards themselves and credits other scholars’ works.  Any violations of academic integrity as included in the NASW Code of Ethics where the social work is against the ethical principles of trustworthy and competency.  Plagiarism is viewed as stealing the ideas and concepts of other scholars which illustrates the incompetence of the individual.\nTo avoid plagiarism, students are required to respect their written communication by crediting the authors (Walden University, 2017). Assembly (2008) explains that academic integrity requires students to maintain a balance between their original ideas and representing borrowed ideas and the integration of both representations. To maintain social work values, morals and ethics, a social work student should account and maintain responsibility for their work. The NASW Code of Ethics contains the responsibility of a social worker to the society, their responsibility to their profession, and responsibility as professionals. However, fail to credit another author’s work is violating all the values listed.\nThe NASW Code of Ethics requires all social workers to embed their professional worth through the evaluation of professional behavioral development of all social workers. The code also requires the social work department to commit to producing fully equipped and trained social workers professions who practically applies their skills, values, and knowledge (NASW, 2017). These values are represented in the NASW Code of Ethics, and where violations of the codes question the professionalism of the student.\nIn conclusion, the NASW Code of Ethics provides the values and the mission for social workers. It is a guideline that protects academic integrity in section 4. It is evident from this study that the NASW Code of Ethics enhances professionalism and produces quality students who adhere to the set values. Academic integrity remains a core element of the NASW Code of Ethics and produces knowledgeable students who adhere to plagiarism and cheating guidelines. This calls for the need for all social workers to understand the ethical standards, ethical principles, and mission of the profession. This is attained by acting in honesty and taking responsibility for their work.\nReference\nAssembly, N. D. (2008). Code of ethics of the national association of social workers.\nDiFranks, N. N.

Along the shores of Kant, Aristotles and Socrates I spoke about leadership qualities in a philosophical way. How can the great virtues of these philosophers inspire leaders? What is the personal drive of leaders and what are their values in ethical leadership?\nThe famous 18th century philosopher Immanuel Kant is the inventor of duty ethics. The central notion in duty ethics is the norm, the duty that you have to perform in leading yourself and others. Kant states: 'You are a rational person with a conscience and an ability to reflect. Therefore you can choose, for example, to steal or not steal, lie or not to lie. By this capacity for rational thinking man is able to do the right thing.' This results in Kant’s philosophy on human dignity.\nKant will ask: are you a conscientious human being, a conscientious leader? Yes, as a leader I know my rights and duties in the organization. I take good care of my employees and good care of myself and when I see something unheard or suspicious, I report it to my compliance officer. Kant will say: given your question on ethical leadership, follow your internal standard. If you claim to be a responsible leader, you must also want to act accordingly, following your inner duty. Kant has set a standard for good practice. The primary formulation of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative. This is the standard that all other standards must meet. ‘Categorically’, because it is always and for everyone valid and ‘imperative’ because it is in all instances a demanding position. It contains two rules:\nFirst rule of the categorical imperative is: 'Act only according to that maxim (norm), which means you want it to become a universal law at the same time.' That means that if you are a morally rational person, you will be able to judge your action: whether it could be carried out by anyone in the world without logical contradictions.\nKant's second formulation of the categorical imperative is: 'Treat humanity as an end in itself.' That means you act in such a way that you treat humans always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means. You can use people as a goal (i.e. as doctor, mechanic or a baker), but never merely as a means for that goal. Treat others, as you want them to treat you.\nEthical leadership in Kantian philosophy means: you always follow your internal standard, regardless of the situation or the implications; personally or professionally. If you think something should happen, let it follow from your inner duty, your inner standards. In other words do so and follow that duty. Then you are truly a worthy person and you are able to show ethical leadership.\n13 4 Comments\nLike Comment Share\nLinkedIn User\nIntrinsieke menselijke waardigheid centraal stellen in economische en management theorieën, voor een menswaardigere inrichting van de maatschappij.\nOverigens zouden we nu een 3e categorisch imperatief kunnen toevoegen: 'beschouw de natuur als doel op zich'.\n3y\nLinkedIn User\nMooi verwoord!

How do leadership styles affect ethical decision-making? In this lesson you'll learn the answers to these questions along with a few examples.\nEthical Leadership\nIt's one thing to be a leader. It's another thing to be an ethical leader. In fact, there are a few different leadership styles. As a result, there are different ways by which ethics are approached by different leaders. In this lesson, we are going to go over how this is so with numerous examples.\n5K views\nEthical Differences\nWhat leadership style are you? Are you:\nCoaching? Maybe you have a coaching side to your leadership style.\nPrimitive? Perhaps your style is characterized by being autocratic in some sense.\nModern? Unlike the primitive leadership style, you might be more democratic.\nThese are just some of the many leadership styles and their potential sub-leadership styles. Beyond leadership styles, we need to recognize that each individual's leadership style might lead to different outcomes when it comes to ethics and ethical decision-making.\nExamples of Leadership Styles\nCoaching\nIn universe #1, we'll say that you have a coaching leadership style. This leadership system often involves characteristics like friendliness, practicality, and support. This means ethical decisions and dilemmas are often dealt with in a fair manner. Furthermore, employees are likely to come forward with any ethical concerns they develop as they trust you to support them in their quest to develop a more ethical workplace.\nPrimitive\nIn universe #2, you have a primitive/autocratic leadership style. This style is characterized by a lack of care for other people's feelings, input or ideas from employees, and so on. You might see this as being negative with respect to ethical dilemmas. You'd only be partially correct. If there is a serious ethical dilemma, you can actually trust such leaders to deal swiftly with the problem by getting rid of the people involved without hesitation--no frou-frou meetings, no unnecessary warnings. This type of leader just gets it done. On the flip side, less serious and protracted ethical dilemmas that require finesse are not suited to this leadership style. These dilemmas require the rebuilding of trust and the improvement of employee morale, which isn't always this leadership style's strong point.\nModern\nIn universe #3, you have a modern/democratic leadership style. This is the style that is great for collaborative approaches to settling ethical dilemmas. It improves trust and morale since it involves everyone, not just the boss's whims as per the prior universe. The good thing about this leadership style is that everyone feels involved and empowered. The downside could be that it leads to indecision and thus wastes time.\nAre Ethical Leaders Born or Made?\nAre ethical leaders born or made? The general consensus is that as with leaders overall, ethical leaders are not born, they're made. Why? Ethics or ethical decision-making isn't an instinctive process. Ethics is a construct of society, and what is ethical in one culture may not be in another, despite the fact that people across the world share similar genes.\nBusiness / Business 318: Management Ethics", "The NASW code of Ethics | Professional Expectations for Social Worker Engagement in Policy Practice | Policy Training for Field Instructors\nThe NASW code of Ethics\nEthical Principles\nValue: Social Justice\nEthical Principle\nSocial workers challenge social injustice.  Social workers pursue social change, particularly with and on behalf of vulnerable and oppressed individuals and groups of people. Social  workers' social change efforts are focused primarily on issues of  poverty, unemployment, discrimination, and other forms of social  injustice. These activities seek to promote sensitivity to and knowledge about oppression and cultural and ethnic diversity. Social workers strive to ensure access to needed information, services, and resources; equality of opportunity; and meaningful participation in decision making for all people.\nIt’s important to note there are Codes of Ethics which outline how we are to remain diligent in working with our individual clients but also the importance of understanding how to impact the community where the client resides subsequently impacting the client.\nEthical Standards\n6. SOCIAL WORKERS’ ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE BROADER SOCIETY\n6.01 Social Welfare\nSocial workers should promote the general welfare of society, from local to global levels, and the development of people, their communities, and their environments. Social workers should advocate for living conditions conducive to the fulfillment of basic human needs and should promote social, economic, political, and cultural values and institutions that are compatible with the realization of social justice\n6.02 Public Participation\nSocial workers should facilitate informed participation by the public in shaping social policies and institutions.\n6.04 Social and Political Action (a)\nSocial workers should engage in social and political action that seeks to ensure that all people have equal access to the resources, employment, services, and opportunities they require to meet their basic human needs and to develop fully. Social workers should be aware of the impact of the political arena on practice and should advocate for changes in policy and legislation to improve social conditions in order to meet basic human needs and promote social justice.\nNASW reminds us to remain vigilant to the needs of the larger community as well. As we provide individual services to our clients, we are responsible to ensure and understand how the community, systems, structures impede the individuals client to actualize personal changes/growth. If we do not understand the systems impacting the individual, we are disserving our clients. They can complete our service plans, programming, feeling equipped to create a better life for themselves and family, only moving back into communities/programs that impede any true progress. We must be prepared to advocate for those individual clients in a macro manner.", "How do teachers make judgments about ethical and unethical behaviors? Toward the development of a code of conduct for teachers | Request PDF\nHow do teachers make judgments about ethical and unethical behaviors? Toward the development of a code of conduct for teachers\nAuthors:\nDavid E. Barrett\nJane Elizabeth Casey\nTexas A&M University Central Texas\nRyan D. Visser\nClemson University\nKathy Headley\nClemson University\nAbstract\nThe authors examined the dimensions that underlie teachers' judgments about ethical versus unethical behaviors. 593 educators and teachers in training were administered a 41 item survey. For each item, respondents rated the extent to which they believed the behavior (a) occurred frequently and (b) represented a serious violation of professional standards. Four factors were identified: Personal Harm, Grade Inflation, Carelessness and Public/Private boundary violation. Personal Harm violations were rated as most serious and Carelessness violations most frequent. Professional educators viewed Carelessness violations as less serious than did teachers in training. Implications for a code of ethics for teachers were addressed.\nNo full-text available\n... Maxwell and Schwimmer's (2016) research emphasizes teachers' role as moral models for their students from the beginning of formal teacher education. In the international literature, a recent trend has been to place greater emphasis on establishing ethical standards for the teaching profession (Barrett, Headley, Stovall & Witte, 2006; Barrett, Casey, Visser & Headley, 2012; Campbell, 2000;Weil, 2005) and integrating course(s) developed in accordance with these standards into teacher training programs.  ...\n... To illustrate, Barrett et al. (2006) developed a scale to detect teachers' perceptions of professional ethics with a threedimensional structure: boundary violations, non-professional inattentive (behavior), and subjective evaluation. Barrett et al. (2012) further refined this three-factor structure and applied it to social media. The three factors identified were as follows: boundary violations, carelessness in teaching, and subjective assessment.  ...\n... The relevant literature shows that the use of technology and social media is an important point to consider in the context of teachers' professional ethics (Barrett et al., 2006;2012). For example, Barrett et al. (2012) consider the use of social media to be an ethics violation in their comprehensive field work on teacher ethics. They refer to studies in different countries finding out that the unethical use of social media causes teachers to be fired or suspended from their work.  ...\nDevelopment and validation of a professional ethics scale for pre-service teachers\nArticle\nFull-text available\nDec 2018\nSevinc Gelmez Burakgazi\nIclal Can\nView\nShow abstract\n... According to a study conducted by Kurtulan (2007), it was concluded that teachers did not adequately comprehend the importance and priority of Professional Ethics in professional practice. As a result of factor analysis conducted by Barrett, Casey, Visser, Headley (2012) considering the prioritization of 41 unethical teacher behaviors, unethical behaviors of teachers were divided into four factors as personal loss, indifference, public and private limits, and class inflation. In this work, personal loss has similarities with the theme of divergence from pedagogical principles in terms of their content; the theme of indifference with the failure to fulfil responsibility; public and private boundaries with the themes of the disrespect to personal boundaries, and non-compliance with institutional values and norms.  ...\n... All this suggests that some teachers are personally distant from the integrity of values. According to a study conducted by Barrett et al. (2012), making a humiliating comment on a teacher about a colleague is a common and serious teacher behavior. A teacher who exhibits ethical behavior is honest and sincere in his/her relationships.  ...\n... A study conducted by Barrett et al. (2006) found that teachers exhibited behavior \"deliberately allowing a student to violate a school rule in their classroom\" at a frequency of 35%. According to a study by Barrett et al. (2012), allowing students to violate school rules, wasting time in class with irrelevant activities, fail to keep an accurate record of student performance, entering the class unprepared are considered as moderately encountered important unethical teacher behaviors. According to CPC (2018), it is an ethical obligation for teachers to fulfil their contractual commitments with the employer, provide the best service within their capabilities, and be consistent in the implementation of institutional policies and instructions.  ...\nUnethical Behaviors of Teachers in Their Relationships with the School Stakeholders\nArticle\nFull-text available\nFeb 2020\nİsa Yıldırım\nCanan Albez\nDurdağı Akan\nView\nShow abstract\n... Student teachers refer to a university student oriented to the teaching profession, trained in teaching skills, and involved in a schoolbased field experience (Zhang, 2014;Zhu et al., 2019). Student teachers belong to preservice teachers, and they are in the process of learning how to become formal teachers and lacking a lot of teaching experience, but they already have the tendency of teacher's moral behaviors at this stage which behavioral patterns may predict their future behaviors (Barrett et al., 2012). Student teachers' morality has a great influence on their future educational practice (Atjonen, 2012;Bosica et al., 2021).  ...\n... To reduce unethical professional behavior tendencies of student teachers at the beginning of their training, it is necessary to develop a measure of student teachers' unethical professional behavior tendencies. However, there are few studies on student teachers' unethical professional behavior tendencies, and more studies mainly focus on primary and secondary school teachers who are already working (Ge, 2008; Barrett et al., 2012; Guo, 2017;Cai, 2019). Unethical professional behavior is a social behavior, its hierarchy is developed in the most frequently occurring sett, and it has a close relationship with the social culture (Whiting, 1980).  ...\n... Nearly all studies about teachers' unethical professional behaviors applied factor analysis to the measurement tools used, and the subscales have been compiled according to the theoretical conception of unethical professional behaviors (Barrett et al., 2012; Eren and Rakıcıoglu-Söylemez, 2017;Guo, 2017). This method ignores the commonalities and differences between the various dimensions.  ...\nDevelopment and Validation of an Unethical Professional Behavior Tendencies Scale for Student Teachers\nArticle\nFull-text available\nDec 2021\nJing Wang\nXinqiang Wang\nJia-Yuan Li\nBao-juan Ye\nView\nShow abstract\n... Educators have long struggled to advance the perception that teaching is a highly complex profession, worthy of the same status characterizing other licensed professions, such as law, medicine, and psychology (Barrett et al., 2012; Ingersoll & Merrill, 2011). Studies have emphasized teachers' professional knowledge as a key indicator in the definition of teaching as a profession (Fuller et al., 2013;Ingersoll & Merrill, 2011;Price & Weatherby, 2018;Shulman, 1986Shulman, , 1987Winch, 2004).  ...\n... The interface of teacher professionalism and ethics concerns not only ethical knowledge; it also alludes to teachers' ethical reasoning-namely, the process of dealing with an ethical dilemma-and teachers' behaviors in actual cases (Shapira-Lishchinsky, 2016. Ethical teaching is invariably about decision-making that recognizes and balances competing professional, institutional, and personal interests (Barrett et al., 2012; Ehrich et al., 2011). Teachers' analysis of ethical dilemmas is influenced by their professional ethics, legal policies, organizational culture, the social context, and their own values and beliefs, among other factors (Ehrich et al., 2011; see also Sanger & Osguthorpe, 2011).  ...\n... Teachers not acknowledging the importance of students' rights are likely to adopt practices that not only derogate students' rights but also hinder the development of students' rights consciousness. Another implication of the study concerns the critical need to design policies focusing on the moral aspects of schooling, including ethical codes (see Barrett et al., 2012; Bullough, 2011;Shapira-Lishchinsky, 2018). A school culture that respects students' privacy may produce an organizational privacy climate that shapes teachers' perceptions (compare Hadar et al., 2018).  ...\nDifferential rights consciousness: Teachers’ perceptions of privacy in the surveillance school\nArticle\nFull-text available\nMay 2021\nTEACH TEACH EDUC\nMichael Birnhack\nLotem Perry-Hazan\nView\nShow abstract\n... Society expects teachers to be guided by ethical principles in dealing with bullying. Teachers are perceived as professionals who help shape society and therefore, should be capable of making ethical decisions for the general good and for shaping the coming generations of citizens [1], [8].  ...\n... Morally, by engaging in such dilemmas, teachers elevate the importance of basic human values, egalitarianism and moral judgment based on concepts of universal human rights. Operatively, studies show that familiarity with a variety of ethical dilemmas and ethical principles assist teachers in constructing a professional and efficient toolbox [1], [8].  ...\n... Both groups proposed dilemmas that could be categorized into four domains: teacher-student relations; teacher-parent relations; teacher-peer and teachermanagement relations. These domains are similar to those noted in studies dealing with ethical dilemmas that engage educators [8].  ...\nTeam-based Simulations among Teacher Trainees: Ethical Dilemmas and Psychological Empowerment in School Bullying Cases\nArticle\nDec 2019\nYifat Davidoff\nOrly Shapira-Lishchinsky\nView\n... It is a fact that any behavior not complying with ethical values will cause various problems (Karatas, Caner, Kahyaoglu & Kahya, 2019). Professional ethics are expressed as common norms that guide professional staff in the process of conducting various professions and support the resolution of difficulties in performing the profession (Barrett, Casey, Visser & Headley, 2012).  ...\n... In Turkey, one of the recommendations taken at the 19th National Education Council is expressed as, 'As in every profession, the ethical codes and professional standards of the teaching profession, which are strategically important in increasing the social reputation of the teaching profession, should be established immediately and shared with the relevant parties.' (MoNE 2017). Both this decision and the points emphasized by the researchers draw attention to the need to create ethical values regarding the teaching profession (Barrett et al., 2012; Maloney & Matthews, 2020;Weil 2005). Teachers follow the teaching of professional ethical principles and standards, including justice, equity, providing a healthy and safe environment, avoiding corruption, honesty, righteousness, neutrality, occupational commitment, continuous improvement, respect, and effective use of resources (Aydin, 2016).  ...\nEvaluating Prospective Mathematics Teachers’ Development of Ethical Knowledge and Awareness\nArticle\nFull-text available\nDec 2021\nKasım Karataş\nNadide Yılmaz\nView\nShow abstract\n... Notably, in times of crisis, people can often see themselves as part of a larger moral community that is compassionate towards those experiencing problems (Crawford, 2017). However, both in Turkey and in other countries, it is seen that teachers are also become the main topic of conversation from time to time with their attitudes or behaviors that are not right or good (Barrett et al., 2012; Tezcan & Güvenç, 2020).  ...\n... The results obtained in different studies support these results in certain aspects. For example, teachers' raising the student grade due to family pressure was a serious ethical problem (Barrett et al., 2012). However, \"no score pollution\" (in other words, accurate assessment) is considered an essential guide in teachers' professional ethics (Green et al., 2007).  ...\nMeaning and Uniqueness of Ethics and Ethical Teacher Behaviors in the Teaching Profession\nArticle\nFull-text available\nNov 2021\nFatih Şahin\nİbrahim Yüksel\nView\nShow abstract\n... Despite the facts that this teacher taught in a public school, was over 21 years of age, and had her Facebook page set to private, she was still asked to resign her position. In addition to public and private boundaries, there also exist concerns that social network sites may blur the lines between the personal and professional relationships between students and teachers (Barrett, Casey, Visser, & Headley, 2012; Preston, 2011).  ...\n... Lastly, student-teacher interaction is an additional area that deserves more attention. In many cases, teachers are prohibited from or purposefully avoid interacting with students on social media sites in order to maintain professional boundaries (see, e.g., Barrett et al., 2012). However, research, including the present study, has demonstrated that some teachers do interact with students.  ...\nThe Implications of Twitter as a Self-Directed Professional Development Tool for K-12 Teachers\nArticle\nAug 2014\nRyan D.

Often times, however, university-based leadership preparation programs are lacking in the ability to prepare school leaders to effectively grapple with ethical decision-making. Furthermore, day-to-day ethical decision-making may be guided by but are ultimately removed from professional codes of ethics that are articulated and codified by various professional organizations. This chapter considers ethical decision-making from three broad categories: deontological or duty-based, teleological or consequences-based, and axiological or virtue ethics perspectives. In addition, several forms of justice are considered that range from a basic understanding of procedural justice that focuses on the implementation of rules and laws to the broadest sense of the word that grapples with institutionalized and societal forms of oppression and privilege that perpetuate inequities and advantage through often unquestioned norms and conventions. Finally, ethical checkpoints are presented as a way of structuring ethical decision-making with which school leaders are often faced. Ethical decision-making is a complex, ongoing process that must be navigated, on a daily basis, by school leaders. Having a good understanding of various ethical theories, as well as different forms of justice, allows school leaders to appropriately examine and defend decisions that are made to foster and maintain a sense of justice, compassion, and care within the environment over which they lead. This chapter presents an overview of ethical decision-making paradigms and processes that are a necessary consideration for school leaders.\nKeywords\nAct deontology Act utilitarianism Axiology Categorial imperative CharacterConstitutional rights Deontological ethics Ethics of care Ethics of consequencesEudaimonia Justice Moral objectivism Realism Rule deontology Rule utilitarianismSituational ethics Social justice Teleological ethics Utilitarianism VIrtue ethicsZero tolerance policies\nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access.\nReferences\nABC News (2013).

{"query_id": "93", "generated_response": "# Constitutional Protection of Civil Liberties\n\nThe U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights establish fundamental protections for individual civil liberties through several key mechanisms and amendments.\n\n## Structure of Civil Liberty Protections\n\nThe Bill of Rights can be broadly divided into three categories of protections [2][3]:\n- **The First, Second, Third, and Fourth Amendments** protect basic individual freedoms\n- **The Fourth (partly), Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Amendments** protect people suspected or accused of criminal activity\n- **The Ninth and Tenth Amendments** acknowledge that rights extend beyond those explicitly listed and preserve state authority\n\n## Key Amendments and Their Protections\n\n### The Fourth Amendment: Privacy and Search Rights\n\nThe Fourth Amendment provides critical protection against unreasonable government intrusion [5]:\n\n> \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\n\n**Key protections include:**\n- Requirement for search warrants based on probable cause [5]\n- Protection of reasonable expectations of privacy\n- The exclusionary rule, which prevents illegally obtained evidence from being used in court [5]\n\n**Supreme Court interpretations** have established important precedents like *Mapp v. Ohio* (1961), which applied the exclusionary rule to state courts, and *Arizona v. Gant* (2009), which limited warrantless car searches [5].\n\n### The Second Amendment: Right to Bear Arms\n\nThe Second Amendment states [5]:\n> \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\n**Supreme Court evolution:**\n- Historically interpreted as protecting state militia rights\n- *District of Columbia v. Heller* (2008) established individual right to bear arms for \"traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home\" [5]\n- *McDonald v. Chicago* (2010) applied this individual right against state governments [5]\n\nHowever, the Court has made clear that gun rights, like other constitutional rights, are not absolute [5].\n\n## Supreme Court's Role in Interpreting Civil Liberties\n\nThe Supreme Court exercises significant authority in defining the scope and limits of civil liberties [4]. Key aspects of judicial interpretation include:\n\n### Balancing Tests and Standards\n\nThe Court often applies balancing tests when civil liberties conflict with government interests. For religious freedom, the Court has used the **Lemon test** and **Sherbert test** to determine when government actions impermissibly burden religious exercise [3][5].\n\n### Selective Incorporation\n\nThrough the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the Supreme Court has gradually applied most Bill of Rights protections to state governments through a process called \"selective incorporation\" [4].\n\n## Civil Liberties vs. National Security\n\n### Historical Precedents\n\nThe tension between individual rights and national security has appeared throughout American history. Notable examples include [1][6]:\n\n- **Korematsu v. United States (1944)**: The Supreme Court upheld Japanese American internment during WWII, demonstrating how national security concerns can override constitutional rights\n- **Schenck v. United States (1919)**: Established the \"clear and present danger\" test, allowing restrictions on speech during wartime [5]\n\n### The Patriot Act and Fourth Amendment Concerns\n\nThe USA PATRIOT Act, enacted after 9/11, has raised significant constitutional concerns, particularly regarding Fourth Amendment protections [7][8]:\n\n**Key controversies include:**\n- **Expanded surveillance powers** without traditional warrant requirements\n- **National Security Letters (NSLs)** that allow bulk data collection with minimal judicial oversight [7]\n- **Bulk metadata collection** that occurs without individualized suspicion\n\n**Constitutional tensions:**\nThe Fourth Amendment requires that searches be \"reasonable\" and typically based on probable cause [8]. Critics argue the Patriot Act violates this by:\n- Authorizing surveillance of citizens without specific warrants or probable cause [8]\n- Allowing \"fishing expeditions\" through broad data collection\n- Operating in secrecy that prevents judicial review [7]\n\n### The Submajoritarian Fourth Amendment\n\nLegal scholars have noted that the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Fourth Amendment has become \"distinctly submajoritarian\" - meaning it provides less protection than public opinion might support [7]. This creates a gap between constitutional values (what people believe the Constitution should protect) and constitutional law (what courts actually enforce).\n\n## Ongoing Challenges and Balances\n\nThe relationship between civil liberties and national security remains an active area of constitutional interpretation. Key considerations include:\n\n1. **Judicial Review Limitations**: Courts often defer to executive and legislative branches on national security matters [7]\n\n2. **Secrecy and Accountability**: Many surveillance programs operate in secrecy, making constitutional challenges difficult [7]\n\n3. **Evolving Technology**: New technologies create novel privacy concerns that existing constitutional frameworks struggle to address\n\n4. **Democratic Oversight**: The role of Congress in providing oversight of executive surveillance powers remains contested [7]\n\nThe ongoing challenge is maintaining the constitutional balance between protecting national security and preserving the individual liberties that define American democracy. As the search results demonstrate, this balance continues to evolve through Supreme Court decisions, legislative action, and public debate about the proper scope of government power in a free society.", "citations": ["https://www.civicsrenewalnetwork.org/resources/national-security-trumps-individual-rights/", "https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/amnatgov/chapter/securing-basic-freedoms/", "https://courses.lumenlearning.com/sanjacinto-atdcoursereview-usgovernment-1/chapter/securing-basic-freedoms/", "https://wwnorton.com/college/polisci/american-government12/core/ch/04/outline.aspx\n", "https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/americangovernment2e/chapter/securing-basic-freedoms/", "https://www.annenbergclassroom.org/resource/civil-liberties-vs-national-security-a-wartime-balancing-act/", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228219679_The_USA_Patriot_Act_and_the_Submajoritarian_Fourth_Amendment", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/awyltu/how_does_the_patriot_act_violate_the_4th/"], "contexts": ["When National Security Trumps Individual Rights - CIVICS RENEWAL NETWORK\nHome » Resources »\nWhen National Security Trumps Individual Rights\nOn December 18, 1944, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down one of its most controversial decisions when it upheld the government’s decision to intern all persons of Japanese ancestry (both alien and nonalien) on the grounds of national security. Over two-thirds of the Japanese in America were citizens and the internment took away their constitutional rights. In this lesson, students evaluate the consequences of past events and decisions related to the Supreme Court case Korematsu v. United States (1944). They consider the challenges involved when trying to balance civil liberties and national security during threatening times and reflect on the lessons learned about civil liberties from the justices in the Korematsu case.\nhttp://www.annenbergclassroom.org/Files/Documents/LessonPlans/Korematsulesson_new.pdf\nView Resource\nResource provided by Annenberg Classroom\nStandards\nNational Standards for Civics and Government\nGrades\n9, 10, 11, 12\nSubjects\nJudicial Branch/Supreme Court\nIssues\nNational Security\nResource Types\nLesson Plans\nTeaching Strategies\nWhole Class\nTags\nrights, World War II, civil liberties, citizens, Korematsu v.

The First, Second, Third, and Fourth Amendments protect basic individual freedoms; the Fourth (partly), Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth protect people suspected or accused of criminal activity; the Ninth and Tenth are consistent with the framers’ view that the Bill of Rights is not necessarily an exhaustive list of all the rights people have and guarantees a role for state as well as federal government.\nIndividual Freedoms\nThe First Amendment protects the right to freedom of religious conscience and practice and the right to free expression, particularly of political and social beliefs. The Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, as well as the collective right to protect the community as part of the militia. The Third Amendment prohibits the government from commandeering people’s homes to house soldiers, particularly in peacetime. Finally, the Fourth Amendment prevents the government from searching our persons or property or taking evidence without a warrant issued by a judge, with certain exceptions.\nThe First Amendment\nThe First Amendment is perhaps the most famous provision of the Bill of Rights; it is arguably the most extensive, because it guarantees both religious freedoms and the right to express your views in public. Specifically, the First Amendment says:\n“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”\nGiven the broad scope of this amendment, it is helpful to break it into its two major parts.\nThe first part protects two related aspects of religious freedom: first, it prevents the government from imposing a specific religion on the people, and secondly it prevents the government from restricting the people from recognition and exercise of their own specific religion.\nThe Establishment Clause\nThe establishment clause is the first of these. Congress cannot create or promote a state-sponsored religion (this also includes the states now). When the United States was founded, most countries’ governments had an established church or religion, an officially sponsored set of religious beliefs and values.  Direct alliances between a state and a religion frequently led to religiously aligned wars and state sponsored tyranny against anyone with religious beliefs outside of the official church.\nMany settlers in the United States were refugees from these wars and state sponsored religious intolerance; they sought the freedom to follow their own religion with like-minded people in relative peace. As a practical matter, even if the early United States had tried to establish a single national religion, the existing diversity of religious beliefs would have hindered it.\nThe establishment clause today is interpreted more broadly; it forbids the creation of a “Church of the United States” or “Church of Ohio” and forbids the government from favoring one set of religious beliefs over others or favoring religion (of any variety) over non-religion.\nThe key question facing the courts is whether the establishment clause should be understood as imposing, in Thomas Jefferson’s words, “a wall of separation between church and state.” In a 1971 case known as Lemon v. Kurtzman, the Supreme Court established the Lemon test for deciding whether a law or other government action that might promote a particular religious practice should be allowed to stand. [1]\nThe Lemon test has three criteria that must be satisfied for such a law or action to be found constitutional and remain in effect:\nThe action or law must not lead to excessive government entanglement with religion; in other words, policing the boundary between government and religion should be relatively straightforward and not require extensive effort by the government.\nThe action or law cannot either inhibit or advance religious practice; it should be neutral in its effects on religion.\nThe action or law must have some secular purpose; there must be some non-religious justification for the law.\nA school cannot prohibit students from voluntary, non-disruptive prayer because that would impair the free exercise of religion. The general statement that “prayer in schools is illegal” or unconstitutional is incorrect. However, the establishment clause does limit official endorsement of any religion, including prayers organized or otherwise facilitated by school authorities, even as part of off-campus or extracurricular activities. [2]\nSome laws appearing to establish certain religious practices are allowed. The courts have permitted religiously inspired blue laws, for example, limiting working hours or even shuttering businesses on Sunday, the Christian day of rest, because by allowing people to practice their (Christian) faith, such rules may help ensure the “health, safety, recreation, and general well-being” of citizens. They have allowed restrictions on the sale of alcohol and sometimes other goods on Sunday for similar reasons.\nWhy has the establishment clause been so controversial? Government officials acknowledge that we live in a society with vigorous religious practice where most people believe in God—even if we disagree on the nature of God or how to worship. Disputes often arise over how much the government can acknowledge this widespread religious belief. The courts have allowed for a certain tolerance of what is described as ceremonial deism, an acknowledgement of God or a creator that lacking any specific and substantive religious detail. For example, the national motto “In God We Trust,” appearing on our coins and paper money, is seen as more of an acknowledgment that most citizens believe in God than of any effort by government officials to promote religious belief and practice. This reasoning applies to the inclusion of the phrase “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance—a change originating during the early years of the Cold War.\nThe courts have also allowed some religiously motivated actions by government agencies, such as clergy delivering prayers to open city council meetings and legislative sessions, on the presumption that—unlike school children—adult participants can distinguish between the government’s allowing someone to speak and endorsing that person’s speech. Yet, while some displays of religious codes (e.g., Ten Commandments) are permitted in the context of showing the evolution of law over the centuries, in other cases, these displays have been removed after state supreme court rulings. In Oklahoma, the courts ordered the removal of a Ten Commandments sculpture at the state capitol when other groups, including Satanists and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, attempted to get their own sculptures allowed there on an equal footing.\nThe motto “In God We Trust” has appeared intermittently on U.S. coins since the 1860s (a), yet it was not mandated on paper currency until 1957. The Ten Commandments are prominently displayed on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol in Austin (b), though a similar sculpture was ordered to be removed in Oklahoma.

It does not regulate the government’s promotion of religion, but rather government suppression of religious beliefs and practices. Controversy surrounding the free exercise clause reflects the way laws or rules that apply to everyone might apply to people with particular religious beliefs. For example, can a Jewish police officer whose religious belief requires her to observe Shabbat be compelled to work on a Friday night or during the day on Saturday? Or must the government accommodate this religious practice even if the general law or rule in question is not applied equally to everyone?\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Jehovah’s Witness cases demonstrated the difficulty of striking the right balance. Their church teaches that they should not participate in military combat. It’s members also refuse to participate in displays of patriotism, including saluting the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.  They also regularly recruit converts through door-to-door evangelism. These activities have led to frequent conflict with local authorities. Jehovah’s Witness children were punished in public schools for failing to salute the flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance, and members attempting to evangelize were arrested for violating laws prohibiting door-to-door solicitation. In early legal challenges brought by Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Supreme Court was reluctant to overturn state and local laws that burdened their religious beliefs. [3]\nHowever, in later cases, the court upheld the rights of Jehovah’s Witnesses to proselytize and refuse to salute the flag or recite the Pledge. [4]\nThe rights of conscientious objectors—individuals who refuse to perform military service on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience, or religion—have also been controversial, although many conscientious objectors have contributed service as non-combatant medics during wartime. To avoid serving in the Vietnam War, many people claimed conscientious objection to military service in a war they considered unwise or unjust. The Supreme Court, however, ruled in Gillette v. United States that to claim to be a conscientious objector, a person must be opposed to serving in any war, not just some wars. [5]\nAmish farm scene in Pennsylvania, Carol M. Highsmith, Photographer, between 1980—2006; at https:www.loc.gov/item/2011630183\nThe Supreme Court has been challenged to establish a general framework for deciding if a religious belief can override general laws and policies. In the 1960s and 1970s, the court decided two establishing a general test for deciding similar future cases. In both Sherbert v. Verner, dealing with unemployment compensation, and Wisconsin v. Yoder ,  dealing with the right of Amish parents to homeschool their children, the court said that for a law to be allowed to limit or burden a religious practice, the government must meet two criteria. [6]\nIt must demonstrate both a “ compelling governmental interest ” in limiting that practice and that restriction must be “narrowly tailored.” In other words, it must show a very good reason for that law and demonstrate that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal. This standard became known as the Sherbert test. Since the burden of proof in these cases was on the government, the Supreme Court made it very difficult for the federal and state governments to enforce laws against individuals that would infringe upon their religious beliefs.\nIn 1990, the Supreme Court made a controversial decision substantially narrowing the Sherbert test in Employment Division v. Smith, more popularly known as “the peyote case.” [7]\nVeiled Muslim Women, 1898-1914, Matson Photograph Collection, Library of Congress at https://www.loc.gov/item/mpc2004006830/PP\nThis case involved two men who were members of the Native American Church, a religious organization that uses the hallucinogenic peyote plant as part of its sacraments. After being arrested for possession of peyote, the two men were fired from their jobs as counselors at a private drug rehabilitation clinic. When they applied for unemployment benefits, the state refused to pay on the basis that they had been dismissed for work-related reasons. The men appealed the denial of benefits and were initially successful, since the state courts applied the Sherbert test and found that the denial of unemployment benefits burdened their religious beliefs. However, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6–3 decision that the “compelling governmental interest” standard should not apply; instead, so long as the law was not designed to target a person’s religious beliefs in particular, it was not up to the courts to decide that those beliefs were more important than the law in question.\nOn the surface, a case involving the Native American Church seems unlikely to arouse much controversy. It replaced the Sherbert test with one allowing more government regulation of religious practices and followers of other religions grew concerned that state and local laws, even ones neutral on their face, might be used to curtail their own religious practices. Congress responded to this decision in 1993 with a law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), followed in 2000 by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act after part of the RFRA was struck down by the Supreme Court. According to the Department of Justice, RFRA mandates strict scrutiny before government may violate religious freedoms/free exercise of religious beliefs. RLUIPA designates the government may not impose a “substantial burden” on individual exercise of beliefs or religious freedoms and government must use “the least restrictive means” of carrying out policy while furthering “a compelling interest” on the part of the government. [8] Land zoning issues, eminent domain, and the rights of prisoners exercising their religious beliefs drove the perceived need for this legislation. In addition, twenty-one states have passed state RFRAs since 1990 that include the Sherbert test in state law, and state court decisions in eleven states have enshrined the Sherbert test’s compelling governmental interest interpretation of the free exercise clause into state law. [9]\nHowever, the RFRA itself has its critics. While relatively uncontroversial as applied to the rights of individuals, debate has emerged whether businesses and other groups have religious liberty. In explicitly religious organizations, such as a fundamentalist congregations or the Roman Catholic Church, members have a meaningful, shared religious belief. The application of the RFRA has become more problematic in businesses and non-profit organizations whose owners or organizers may share a religious belief while the organization has some secular, non-religious purpose.\nSuch a conflict emerged in the 2014 Supreme Court case known as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby.[10]\nThe Hobby Lobby chain sells arts and crafts merchandise at hundreds of stores; its founder David Green is a devout Christian whose beliefs include opposition to abortion. Consistent with these beliefs, he objected to a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare) requiring employer-backed insurance plans to include no-charge access to the morning-after pill, a form of emergency contraception, arguing that this requirement infringed on his protected First Amendment right to exercise his religious beliefs. Based in part on the federal RFRA, the Supreme Court agreed 5–4 with Green and Hobby Lobby’s position and said that Hobby Lobby and other closely held businesses did not have to provide employees free access to emergency contraception or other birth control if doing so would violate the religious beliefs of the business’ owners, because there were other less restrictive ways the government could ensure access to these services for Hobby Lobby’s employees (e.g., paying for them directly).\nIn 2015, state RFRAs became controversial when individuals and businesses providing wedding services (e.g., catering and photography) were compelled to provide services for same-sex weddings in states where the practice had been newly legalized. Proponents of state RFRA laws argued that people and businesses should not be compelled to endorse practices their counter to their religious beliefs and feared clergy might be compelled to officiate same-sex marriages against their religion’s specific teachings. Opponents of RFRA laws argued that individuals and businesses should be required, per Obergefell v. Hodges, to serve same-sex marriages on an equal basis as a matter of ensuring the rights of gays and lesbians. [11]\nDespite ongoing controversy the courts have consistently found some public interests sufficiently compelling to override the free exercise clause. For example, since the late nineteenth century the courts have consistently held that people’s religious beliefs do not exempt them from the general laws against polygamy. Other potential acts in the name of religion that are also out of the question are drug use and human sacrifice.\nFreedom of Expression\nAlthough the remainder of the First Amendment protects four distinct rights—free speech, press, assembly, and petition—today we view them as encompassing a right to freedom of expression, particularly as   technological advances blur the lines between oral and written communication (i.e., speech and press).\nControversies over freedom of expression were rare until the 1900s, even amidst common government censorship. During the Civil War the Union post office refused to deliver newspapers opposing the war or sympathizing with the Confederacy, while allowing distribution of pro-war newspapers. The emergence of photography and movies, in particular, led to new public concerns about morality, causing both state and federal politicians to censor lewd and otherwise improper content. At the same time, writers became emboldened and included explicit references to sex and obscene language, leading to government censorship of books and magazines.\nCensorship reached its height during World War I. The United States was swept up in two waves of hysteria. Germany’s actions leading up to United States involvement, including the sinking of the RMS Lusitania and the Zimmerman Telegram (an effort to ally with Mexico against the United States) provoked significant anti-German feelings. Further, the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 overthrowing the Russian government called for communist revolutionaries to overthrow the capitalist, democratic governments in western Europe and North America.\nAmericans vocally supporting the communist cause or opposing the war often found themselves in jail. In Schenck v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that people encouraging young men to dodge the draft could be imprisoned, arguing that recommending people disobey the law was tantamount to “falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic” and thus presented a “clear and present danger” to public order. [12]\nSimilarly, communists and other revolutionary anarchists and socialists during the post-war Red Scare were prosecuted under various state and federal laws for supporting the forceful or violent overthrow of government. This restriction to political speech continued for the next fifty years.\nHowever, in the 1960s the Supreme Court’s rulings on free expression became more liberal, in response to the Vietnam War and the growing antiwar movement. In a 1969 case involving the Ku Klux Klan, Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court ruled that only speech or writing that constituted a direct call or plan to imminent lawless action, an illegal act in the immediate future, could be suppressed; the mere advocacy of a hypothetical revolution was not enough. [13]\nA group of women carrying signs against America’s support of the English against the Irish, burning a flag on the sidewalk, June 3, 1920; collection, Library of Congress at https://www.loc.gov/item/npc2007001720/\nThe Supreme Court also ruled that various forms of symbolic speech —wearing clothing like an armband that carried a political symbol or raising a fist in the air, for example—were subject to the same protections as written and spoken communication.\nBurning the U.S. Flag\nOn the eve of the 2008 election, a U.S. flag was burned in protest in New Hampshire. (credit: modification of work by Jennifer Parr)\nPerhaps no act of symbolic speech has been as controversial in U.S. history as the burning of the flag. Citizens tend to revere the flag as a unifying symbol of the country in much the same way most people in Britain would treat the reigning queen (or king). States and the federal government have long had laws protecting the flag from desecration—defacing, damaging, or otherwise treating it with disrespect. Perhaps in part because of these laws, people wanting to publicize opposition to U.S. government policies have used desecrating the flag a useful way to gain public and press attention to their cause.\nNote the case of Gregory Lee Johnson, a member of various pro-communist and antiwar groups. As part of a protest near the Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas in 1984 Johnson set fire to a U.S. flag that another protestor had torn from a flagpole. He was arrested, charged with “desecration of a venerated object” (among other offenses), and eventually convicted. However, in 1989 the Supreme Court decided in Texas v. Johnson that burning the flag was a form of symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment and found the law, as applied to flag desecration, to be unconstitutional. [14]\nThis court decision was strongly criticized, and Congress responded with a new federal law, the Flag Protection Act, intended to overrule it; this Act was also struck down as unconstitutional in 1990. [15]\nSince then, Congress has attempted several times to propose constitutional amendments allowing the states and federal government to re-criminalize flag desecration—to no avail.\nShould we amend the Constitution to allow Congress or the states to pass laws protecting the U.S. flag from desecration? Should we protect other symbols as well? Why or why not?\nCommercial speech does not retain the same protections as individual free speech and expression. Commercial speech or advertising is subject to more scrutiny by the government because it involves companies or individuals seeking to make a profit. [16] The government protects consumers from business or individuals who would lie to customers in order to make a profit.\nKeeping Drug Advertising Honest and Balanced\nEach year, drug companies spend about $25 billion in the United States promoting their prescription medications. Most goes to promoting drugs to health care professionals, but a growing amount—about one-fifth—is spent on direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising.\nThomas Abrams is the director of the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). He addresses how the FDA protects consumers from false or misleading ads for prescription drugs that appear on TV, radio, online, and in print publications.\nQ: The United States and New Zealand are the only countries where prescription drug advertising is directed at consumers. Why is it allowed?\nA: The First Amendment provides for freedom of speech, including commercial speech by companies. Direct-to-consumer advertising is considered commercial speech. FDA is charged by law to make sure advertising and other promotional materials are accurate and balanced, and provide helpful information to consumers about medical conditions and drugs to treat them. [17]\nFreedom of the press is another important component of the right to free expression. In Near v. Minnesota, a 1931 case regarding press freedoms, the Supreme Court ruled that the government generally could not engage in prior restraint; that is, states and the federal government could not prohibit someone from publishing something in advance without a very compelling reason. [18]\nThis standard was reinforced in the Pentagon Papers case of 1971, when the Supreme Court ruled that the government could not prohibit the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers from publishing the Pentagon Papers. [19]\nThese papers included materials from a secret history of the Vietnam War compiled by the military. These papers were compiled at the request of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and provided a study of U.S. political and military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967. Daniel Ellsberg famously released passages of the Papers to the press to show that the United States had secretly enlarged the scope of the war by bombing Cambodia and Laos while lying to the American public.\nAlthough people who leak secret information to the media can still be prosecuted and punished, this does not generally extend to reporters and news outlets that pass that information on to the public. The Edward Snowden case is a good example. Snowden himself, rather than those involved in promoting the information that he shared, became the object of criminal prosecution.\nThe courts have further recognized that government officials and other public figures might try to silence press criticism and avoid unfavorable news coverage by threatening a lawsuit for defamation of character. In the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, the Supreme Court decided that public figures must demonstrate not only the falsehood of a negative press statement about them, but also that the statement was conveyed with either malicious intent or “reckless disregard” for the truth. [20]\nThis ruling made it much harder for politicians to silence potential critics or to bankrupt their political opponents through the courts.\nThe right to freedom of expression is not absolute; several key restrictions limit our ability to speak or publish opinions under certain circumstances. We have seen that the Constitution protects most forms of offensive and unpopular expression, particularly political speech; however, incitement of a criminal act, “fighting words,” and genuine threats are not protected. So, for example, you cannot point at someone in front of an angry crowd and shout, “Let’s beat up that guy!” And the Supreme Court has allowed laws that ban threatening symbolic speech, such as burning a cross on the lawn of an African American family’s home. [21]\nFinally, defamation of character—whether in written form (libel) or spoken form (slander )—is not protected by the First Amendment. People subject to false accusations can sue to recover damages although criminal prosecutions of libel and slander are rare.\nThe Supreme Court has allowed laws that ban threatening symbolic speech, such as burning crosses on the lawns of African American families, an intimidation tactic used by the Ku Klux Klan, pictured here at a meeting in Gainesville, Florida, on December 31, 1922.\nObscenity is another exception to the right to freedom of expression.  These are acts or statements considered extremely offensive under the current societal standards. The courts are understandably challenged to define obscenity; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity, having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building, “I know it when I see it.” Into the early twentieth century written works were frequently banned as obscene, including those by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller. Today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone. In 1973, the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene: “(a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.” [22]\nApplying this standard has often been problematic. The concept of “contemporary community standards” asserts that obscenity can vary geographically; many people in New York or San Francisco might be unconcerned with something that offends people in Memphis or Salt Lake City. The one form of obscenity that has been banned almost without challenge is child pornography, although the courts have found exceptions even here.\nThe courts have allowed censorship of less-than-obscene content when broadcast over the airwaves, particularly when available for anyone to receive. Generally these restrictions on indecency—a quality of acts or statements that offend societal norms or may be harmful to minors—apply only to radio and television programming broadcast when children might be in the audience.  Most cable and satellite channels follow similar standards for commercial reasons.\nIn the 1990s Congress compelled television broadcasters to implement a television ratings system enforced by a “V-Chip” in televisions and cable boxes, so parents could better control the television programming their children might watch. However, similar efforts to protect children from pornography on the internet have largely been struck down as unconstitutional. This demonstrates that technology has created new avenues for disseminate obscene material. The Children’s Internet Protection Act, however, requires K–12 schools and public libraries receiving Internet access using special E-rate discounts to filter or block access to material deemed harmful to minors.\nThe courts have also allowed laws forbidding or compelling certain forms of expression by businesses. Examples are laws requiring nutritional information disclosure on food and beverage containers and warning labels on tobacco products. The federal government requires that prices advertised for airline tickets include all taxes and fees. Many states regulate advertising by lawyers. False or misleading statements made in connection with a commercial transaction can be illegal if they constitute fraud.\nThe surgeon general’s warning label on a box of cigarettes is mandated by the Food and Drug Administration. The United States was the first nation to require a health warning on cigarette packages. (credit: Debora Cartagena, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\nThe courts have also ruled that, although public school officials are government actors, the First Amendment freedom of expression rights of children attending public schools are somewhat limited. In particular, in Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) and Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier (1988), the Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on speech that create “substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others” [23] or is “reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.” [24]\nFor example, the content of school-sponsored activities like school newspapers and speeches delivered by students can be controlled, either for student instruction in proper adult behavior or to deter student conflict.\nFree expression includes the right to assemble peaceably and the right to petition government officials. This right even extends to members of groups whose views most people find abhorrent.  Examples are American Nazis and the activist Westboro Baptist Church, whose members are known for protesting at the funerals of U.S. soldiers who have died fighting in the war on terror. [25]\nThe Supreme Court in National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) v. Alabama (1958) considered the rights of organizations of freely assembled persons to keep membership records confidential. As noted in the David M. Rubenstein Gallery of the National Archives, “T hroughout the South, officials sought to discredit the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) since it threatened white supremacy.\nIn 1956, Alabama ordered the review of the organization’s documents, including membership lists. The NAACP refused to disclose its members. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court sided with the NAACP and formally recognized a constitutional right to freedom of association. The forced disclosure of membership lists violated NAACP members’ right ‘to pursue their lawful private interests privately and to associate freely with others.’ By recognizing the importance of confidential membership data, especially among unpopular groups, the NAACP v. Alabama decision furthered informational privacy rights.” [26]\nTwo eagle scouts at the BSA National Headquarters and museum in Irving, Texas.\nRelying on precedent, the court considered arguments in 2006 involving the Boy Scouts of America. In Boy Scouts of America et al. v. Dale (2000), the court examined competing rights–the rights of an openly gay leader in the BSA, James Dale, who was removed from his position as a scoutmaster (discrimination based on sexual orientation in public accommodation) and the rights of the BSA (1st Amendment protected freedom of assembly), where the Court held: Applying New Jersey’s public accommodations law to require the Boy Scouts to readmit Dale violates the Boy Scouts’ First Amendment right of expressive association. Government actions that unconstitutionally burden that right may take many forms, one of which is intrusion into a group’s internal affairs by forcing it to accept a member it does not desire. [27]\nFree expression—although a broad right—is subject to certain constraints to balance it against the interests of public order. In particular, the nature, place, and timing of protests—but not their substantive content—are subject to reasonable limits. The courts have ruled that while people may peaceably assemble in a place that is a public forum, not all public property is a public forum. For example, the inside of a government office building or a college classroom—particularly while someone is teaching—is not generally considered a public forum.\nRallies and protests on land that has other dedicated uses such as roads and highways can be limited to groups that have secured a permit in advance, and those organizing large gatherings may be required to give sufficient notice so government authorities can ensure there is enough security available. However, any such regulation must be viewpoint-neutral; the government may not treat one group differently than another because of its opinions or beliefs. For example, the government can’t permit a rally by a group that favors a government policy but forbid opponents from staging a similar rally. Finally, there have been controversial situations in which government agencies have established free-speech zones for protesters during political conventions, presidential visits, and international meetings in areas that are arguably selected to minimize their public audience or to ensure that the subjects of the protests do not have to encounter the protesters.\nSince 2011, as part of the White House website, the Obama administration has included a dedicated system, “We the People: Your Voice in our Government,” for people to make petitions that will be reviewed by administration officials.\nThe Second Amendment\nFor such a highly charged political issue, the text of the Second Amendment is among the shortest:\n“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”\nThe text’s relative simplicity has not spared it from controversy; arguably, the Second Amendment has become controversial because of its text. Does it merely protect the right of the states to organize and arm a “well regulated militia” for civil defense, or is it a protection of a “right of the people” as a whole to individually bear arms?\nBefore the Civil War, this would have been a nearly meaningless distinction. In most states white males of military age were considered part of the militia, liable to be called for service to put down rebellions or invasions, and the right “to keep and bear Arms” was considered a common-law right inherited from English law predating the federal and state constitutions.\nThe beginning of selective incorporation after the Civil War fueled debates over the Second Amendment. In the meantime several southern states adopted laws that restricted the carrying and ownership of weapons by former slaves as part of their black codes. Despite acknowledging a common-law individual right to keep and bear arms, in 1876 the Supreme Court declined, in United States v. Cruickshank, to intervene to ensure the states would respect it. [28]\nStates gradually began to introduce laws to regulate gun ownership. Federal gun control laws were introduced in the 1930s in response to organized crime, and stricter laws regulating most gun commerce stemming from the street protests of the 1960s. Laws requiring background checks for prospective gun buyers were passed in the early 1980s following an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. During this period, the Supreme Court’s decisions regarding the meaning of the Second Amendment were ambiguous at best. In United States v. Miller, the Supreme Court upheld the 1934 National Firearms Act’s prohibition of sawed-off shotguns, largely because such weapons did not support the goal of promoting a “well regulated militia.” [29]\nThis ruling was interpreted to support the view that the Second Amendment protected the right of the states to organize a militia, rather than an individual right. Consequently the lower courts ruled most firearm regulations—including some city and state laws virtually outlawing private ownership of firearms—to be constitutional.\nIn 2008, in a narrow 5–4 decision on District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court ruled that at least some gun control laws did violate the Second Amendment and that this amendment does protect an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, at least in some circumstances—in particular, “for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.” [30]\nBecause the District of Columbia is not a state, this decision immediately confirmed the right only to the federal government and territorial governments. Two years later, in McDonald v. Chicago, the Supreme Court overturned the Cruickshank decision (5–4) and again ruled that the right to bear arms was a fundamental right incorporated against the states, meaning that state regulation of firearms might, in some circumstances, be unconstitutional. In 2015, however, the Supreme Court allowed several of San Francisco’s strict gun control laws to remain in place. This suggested that—as in the case of rights protected by the First Amendment—the courts will not treat gun rights as absolute. [31]\nA “No Firearms” sign is posted at Binghamton Park in Memphis, Tennessee, demonstrating that the right to possess a gun is not absolute. (credit: modification of work by Thomas R Machnitzki)\nThe Third Amendment\nThe Third Amendment says in full:\n“No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.”\nMany consider this Constitution al provision obsolete and unimportant. However, it is worthwhile to note its relevance in the context of the time: colonial citizens were routinely required to quarter British soldiers during training maneuvers, redeployments and occupations, even in peacetime and irrespective of their circumstances. They viewed the British laws requiring them to house these soldiers as particularly offensive and disrespectful. So much so that it had been among the grievances listed in the Declaration of Independence.\nToday it seems unlikely the federal government would need to house military forces in civilian lodgings against the will of property owners or tenants; however, perhaps in the same way we consider the Second and Fourth amendments, we can think of the Third Amendment as reflecting a broader idea that our homes lie within a “zone of privacy” that government officials should not violate unless absolutely necessary.\nThe Fourth Amendment\nThe Fourth Amendment sits at the boundary between general individual freedoms and the rights of those suspected of crimes. It may reflect James Madison’s broader concern to establish an expectation of privacy from government intrusion at home. The Fourth Amendment protects us from overzealous law enforcement by ensuring investigating authorities have good reason to intrude on people’s privacy and property.\nThe text of the Fourth Amendment is as follows:\n“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”\nThe amendment places limits on both searches and seizures: Searches are efforts to locate evidence and contraband. Seizures are the taking of these items by the government for investigations and as evidence in a criminal prosecution (or, in the case of a person, the detention or taking of the person into custody).\nIt confirms that officials must apply for and receive a search warrant prior to a search or seizure; this warrant is a legal document, signed by a judge, allowing police to search and/or seize persons or property. Since the 1960s, however, the Supreme Court has issued a series of rulings limiting the warrant requirement in situations where a person lacks a “reasonable expectation of privacy” outside the home. Police can also search and/or seize people or property without a warrant if the owner or renter consents to the search, if there is a reasonable expectation that evidence may be destroyed or tampered with before a warrant can be issued (i.e., exigent circumstances), or if the items in question are in plain view of government officials.\nFurthermore, the courts have found that police do not generally need a warrant to search the passenger compartment of a car, or to search people entering the United States from another country. [32]\nWhen a warrant is needed, law enforcement officers do not need enough evidence to secure a conviction, but they must demonstrate to a judge that there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed or evidence will be found. Probable cause is the legal standard for determining whether a search or seizure is constitutional or a crime has been committed; it is a lower threshold than the standard of proof required for a criminal conviction.\nA state police officer conducting a traffic stop near Walla Walla, Washington. (credit: modification of work by Richard Bauer)\nWhat happens when police conduct an illegal search or seizure without a warrant and still find evidence of a crime? In the 1961 Supreme Court case Mapp v. Ohio, the court ruled that evidence obtained without a warrant and not under one of the above exceptions could not be used as evidence in a state criminal trial, leading to the broad application of the exclusionary rule established in 1914 on a federal level in Weeks v. United States.[33]\nThe exclusionary rule does not just apply to evidence found or to items or people seized without a warrant (or falling under an exception noted above); it also applies to any evidence developed or discovered as a result of the illegal search or seizure.\nFor example, if police search your home without a warrant, find bank statements showing large cash deposits on a regular basis, and discover evidence of some other unexpected crime (e.g., blackmail, drugs, or prostitution), they cannot use the bank statements as evidence of criminal activity—nor can they prosecute you for other evidence discovered during that illegal search. This extension of the exclusionary rule is sometimes called the “fruit of the poisonous tree,” because just as the metaphorical tree (i.e., the original search or seizure) is poisoned, so is anything that grows out of it. [34]\nHowever, like the requirement for a search warrant, the exclusionary rule does have exceptions. The courts have allowed evidence obtained without the necessary legal procedures in circumstances where police executed warrants they believed were correctly granted but in fact were not (“good faith” exception), and when the evidence would have been found anyway had they followed the law (“inevitable discovery”).\nThe requirement of probable cause also applies to arrest warrants. A person cannot generally be detained by police or taken into custody without a warrant. However most states allow arrests of a suspected felon  without a warrant when probable cause exists, and police can arrest people for minor crimes or misdemeanors they have witnessed themselves.\nThe first four amendments of the Bill of Rights protect citizens’ key freedoms from governmental intrusion. The First Amendment restricts the government from imposing a specific religion on the people, or limiting the practice of one’s own religion. The First Amendment also protects freedom of expression by the public, the media, and organized groups via rallies, protests, and the petition of grievances. The Second Amendment today protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, while the Third Amendment prevents the military occupation of civilians’ homes except under extraordinary circumstances. Finally, the Fourth Amendment protects our persons and property from unreasonable searches and seizures, and protects people from unlawful arrests. However, all these provisions are subject to limitations, often to protect the interests of public order and the good of society as a whole.\nQuestions to Consider\nExplain the difference between the establishment clause and the free exercise clause, and explain how these two clauses work together to guarantee religious freedoms.\nExplain the difference between the collective rights and individual rights views of the Second Amendment.

Norton StudySpace\nChapter 4\nCivil Liberties\nChapter Study Outline\nIntroduction\nCivil liberties protections regulate government by defining spheres of activity (e.g., speech or religious worship) in which the government’s authority to interfere is limited. Although these constitutional guarantees to citizens seem clear in the abstract, they nevertheless produce vexing problems and controversies when applied to specific cases. And whereas all of the institutions of national government have responsibilities to guard the civil liberties of citizens, the United States Supreme Court exercises a great deal of the civil liberties agenda and decision making in American government.\n1. Origins of the Bill of Rights\nWhat is the historical “path” that gave us the Bill of Rights? What were the arguments made against adopting a Bill of Rights? What did its proponents argue? What are civil liberties?\nAlthough some sought to add a Bill of Rights to the Constitution at the Constitutional Convention, Alexander Hamilton and other Federalists argued against its adoption, claiming that a Bill of Rights was unnecessary and even potentially dangerous to the rights of the people.\nRecognizing the need to appease Antifederalist complaints, James Madison fought for amending the Constitution after ratification to include specific rights protections.\nEventually the Bill of Rights was adopted and ratified, defining the limits of government and the essential liberties of American citizens.\nThe Bill of Rights actually contains provisions that are better understood as civil liberties, the protections of citizens from improper governmental action.\n2. Civil Liberties: Nationalizing the Bill of Rights\nWhat role has the Bill of Rights played throughout American political history? Does the Bill of Rights protect citizens from both the national and state governments? By what process was the Bill of Rights “nationalized”?\nThe rights in the Bill of Rights are better understood as “civil liberties” because they place restraints on government. The Bill of Rights guaranteed a private sphere of personal liberty free of governmental restrictions, although only the First Amendment is explicit in seeking to limit the national government. Thus the question remained: Did the Bill of Rights restrain the state governments as well as the national government?\nIn Barron v. Baltimore (1833), the Supreme Court established the principle of “dual citizenship,” holding that persons were citizens of the national government and state government separately and that the Bill of Rights thus did not apply to the states.\nRatified in 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment held that “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United Sates; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Despite this language, in the Slaughter-House cases, the Supreme Court continued to apply the concept of “dual citizenship,” setting up a process of selective incorporation whereby the Court would selectively “incorporate” rights from the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment on a case-by-case basis.\nBy the 1960s, the Supreme Court had nationalized many rights, including the right to privacy, expanding the reach and power of the national government vis-ˆ-vis the states.\n3. The Bill of Rights Today\nHow are the liberties and rights embodied in the Bill of Rights applied today? What are the most salient controversies involving each of these provisions? And how has the Supreme Court ruled?\nIn regard to religion, the First Amendment states that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”\nThe establishment clause has been interpreted in at least three different ways: (1) that the government cannot establish an official church; (2) that the government cannot take sides among competing religions but can provide assistance to religious institutions so long as it shows no favoritism for any particular religion; and (3) that the government should observe a strict “wall of separation” between church and state. In 1971, the Supreme Court articulated the Lemon Test—a set of criteria intended to provide guidance on whether government aid to religious schools would be considered constitutional.\nThe First Amendment’s free exercise clause also guarantees citizens’ rights to believe and practice whatever religion they choose, although here too the Supreme Court has reserved for itself the right to balance religious claims against public policy.\nThe First Amendment also provides free speech and freedom of the press protections. When difficult choices arise regarding, for example, speech that constitutes “clear and present danger,” symbolic speech, libel and slander, obscenity, “fighting words,” and “hate speech,” the judiciary establishes precedents and rules that determine what speech is or is not constitutionally protected. The courts are also hesitant to allow the government to exercise “prior restraint”—the practice of blocking publication by the press of material deemed harmful to its interests.\nThe Second Amendment is a point of great controversy in contemporary American politics. Although it has largely been fought in the legislative arena and the actual constitutional provision rarely has been decided by the courts, in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) the Supreme Court overruled a District of Columbia gun control ordinance.\nMany of the rights in the Bill of Rights concern individuals accused of a crime, who are entitled to “due process of law.”\nThe Fourth Amendment provides for citizens’ rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, which the court has taken to mean that illegally obtained evidence cannot be used at trial (thereby invoking the exclusionary rule).\nThe Fifth Amendment ensures: that grand juries play important roles in federal criminal cases; that individuals are protected against double jeopardy (that is, they cannot be tried twice for the same crime); that citizens are allowed to “take the Fifth” and refuse to testify against themselves; and that property rights are protected via its eminent domain clause.\nThe Sixth Amendment ensures, among other things, that citizens have the right to counsel in criminal trials.\nThe Eighth Amendment prohibits “excessive bail,” “excessive fines,” and “cruel and unusual punishment.”\nIn Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court held that the Bill of Rights contained a “penumbral” (or implied) right to privacy that would provide a constitutional basis on which to protect a sphere of private activities, including birth control, abortion, the rights of homosexuals, and the right to die in physician-assisted suicides.", "Securing Basic Freedoms – American Government (2e – Second Edition)\nChapter 4: Civil Liberties\nSecuring Basic Freedoms\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nIdentify the liberties and rights guaranteed by the first four amendments to the Constitution\nExplain why in practice these rights and liberties are limited\nExplain why interpreting some amendments has been controversial\nThe First Amendment protects the right to freedom of religious conscience and practice and the right to free expression, particularly of political and social beliefs. The Second Amendment—perhaps the most controversial today—protects the right to defend yourself in your home or other property, as well as the collective right to protect the community as part of the militia. The Third Amendment prohibits the government from commandeering people’s homes to house soldiers, particularly in peacetime. Finally, the Fourth Amendment prevents the government from searching our persons or property or taking evidence without a warrant issued by a judge, with certain exceptions.\nFigure 1. We can broadly divide the provisions of the Bill of Rights into three categories. The First, Second, Third, and Fourth Amendments protect basic individual freedoms; the Fourth (partly), Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth protect people suspected or accused of criminal activity or facing civil litigation; and the Ninth and Tenth, are consistent with the framers’ view that the Bill of Rights is not necessarily an exhaustive list of all the rights people have and guarantees a role for state as well as federal government.\nTHE FIRST AMENDMENT\nThe First Amendment is perhaps the most famous provision of the Bill of Rights; it is arguably also the most extensive, because it guarantees both religious freedoms and the right to express your views in public. Specifically, the First Amendment says:\n“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”\nGiven the broad scope of this amendment, it is helpful to break it into its two major parts.\nThe first portion deals with religious freedom. However, it actually protects two related sorts of freedom: first, it protects people from having a set of religious beliefs imposed on them by the government, and second, it protects people from having their own religious beliefs restricted by government authorities.\n*Watch this video to learn more about freedom of speech.\nFreedom of Speech: Crash Course Government and Politics #25\nWatch later\nWatch on\nThe Establishment Clause\nThe first of these two freedoms is known as the\nestablishment clause\n. Congress is prohibited from creating or promoting a state-sponsored religion (this now includes the states too). When the United States was founded, most countries around the world had an established church or religion, an officially sponsored set of religious beliefs and values. In Europe, bitter wars were fought between and within states, often because the established church of one territory was in conflict with that of another; wars and civil strife were common, particularly between states with Protestant and Catholic churches that had differing interpretations of Christianity. Even today, the legacy of these wars remains, most notably in Ireland, which has been divided between a mostly Catholic south and a largely Protestant north for nearly a century.\nMany settlers in the United States found themselves on this continent as refugees from such wars; others came to find a place where they could follow their own religion with like-minded people in relative peace. So as a practical matter, even if the early United States had wanted to establish a single national religion, the diversity of religious beliefs would already have prevented it. Nonetheless the differences were small; most people were of European origin and professed some form of Christianity (although in private some of the founders, most notably Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and Benjamin Franklin, held what today would be seen as Unitarian and/or deistic views). So for much of U.S. history, the establishment clause was not particularly important—the vast majority of citizens were Protestant Christians of some form, and since the federal government was relatively uninvolved in the day-to-day lives of the people, there was little opportunity for conflict. That said, there were some citizenship and office-holding restrictions on Jews within some of the states.\nWorry about state sponsorship of religion in the United States began to reemerge in the latter part of the nineteenth century. An influx of immigrants from Ireland and eastern and southern Europe brought large numbers of Catholics, and states—fearing the new immigrants and their children would not assimilate—passed laws forbidding government aid to religious schools. New religious organizations, such as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormon Church), Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and many others, also emerged, blending aspects of Protestant beliefs with other ideas and teachings at odds with the more traditional Protestant churches of the era. At the same time, public schooling was beginning to take root on a wide scale. Since most states had traditional Protestant majorities and most state officials were Protestants themselves, the public school curriculum incorporated many Protestant features; at times, these features would come into conflict with the beliefs of children from other Christian sects or from other religious traditions.\nThe establishment clause today tends to be interpreted a bit more broadly than in the past; it not only forbids the creation of a “Church of the United States” or “Church of Ohio” it also forbids the government from favoring one set of religious beliefs over others or favoring religion (of any variety) over non-religion. Thus, the government cannot promote, say, Islamic beliefs over Sikh beliefs or belief in God over atheism or agnosticism.\nFigure 2. In this illustration from a contemporary manuscript, Henry Bolingbroke (i.e., Henry IV) claims the throne in 1399 surrounded by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal (secular). While the Lords Spiritual have been a minority in the House of Lords since the time of Henry VIII, and religion does not generally play a large role in British politics today, the Church of England nevertheless remains represented in Parliament by twenty-six bishops.\nThe key question that faces the courts is whether the establishment clause should be understood as imposing, in Thomas Jefferson’s words, “a wall of separation between church and state.” In a 1971 case known as Lemon v. Kurtzman, the Supreme Court established the Lemon test for deciding whether a law or other government action that might promote a particular religious practice should be allowed to stand. [1] The Lemon test has three criteria that must be satisfied for such a law or action to be found constitutional and remain in effect:\n1. The action or law must not lead to excessive government entanglement with religion; in other words, policing the boundary between government and religion should be relatively straightforward and not require extensive effort by the government.\n2. The action or law cannot either inhibit or advance religious practice; it should be neutral in its effects on religion.\n3. The action or law must have some secular purpose; there must be some non-religious justification for the law.\nFor example, imagine your state decides to fund a school voucher program that allows children to attend private and parochial schools at public expense; the vouchers can be used to pay for school books and transportation to and from school. Would this voucher program be constitutional?\nLet’s start with the secular-purpose prong of the test. Educating children is a clear, non-religious purpose, so the law has a secular purpose. The law would neither inhibit nor advance religious practice, so that prong would be satisfied. The remaining question—and usually the one on which court decisions turn—is whether the law leads to excessive government entanglement with religious practice. Given that transportation and school books generally have no religious purpose, there is little risk that paying for them would lead the state to much entanglement with religion. The decision would become more difficult if the funding were unrestricted in use or helped to pay for facilities or teacher salaries; if that were the case, it might indeed be used for a religious purpose, and it would be harder for the government to ensure that it wasn’t without audits or other investigations that could lead to too much government entanglement with religion.\nThe use of education as an example is not an accident; in fact, many of the court’s cases dealing with the establishment clause have involved education, particularly public education, because school-age children are considered a special and vulnerable population. Perhaps no subject affected by the First Amendment has been more controversial than the issue of prayer in public schools. Discussion about school prayer has been particularly fraught because in many ways it appears to bring the two religious liberty clauses into conflict with each other. The free exercise clause, discussed below, guarantees the right of individuals to practice their religion without government interference—and while the rights of children are not as extensive in all areas as those of adults, the courts have consistently ruled that the free exercise clause’s guarantee of religious freedom applies to children as well.\nAt the same time, however, government actions that require or encourage particular religious practices might infringe upon children’s rights to follow their own religious beliefs and thus, in effect, be unconstitutional establishments of religion. For example, a teacher, an athletic coach, or even a student reciting a prayer in front of a class or leading students in prayer as part of the organized school activities constitutes an illegal establishment of religion. [2] Yet a school cannot prohibit voluntary, non-disruptive prayer by its students, because that would impair the free exercise of religion. So although the blanket statement that “prayer in schools is illegal” or unconstitutional is incorrect, the establishment clause does limit official endorsement of religion, including prayers organized or otherwise facilitated by school authorities, even as part of off-campus or extracurricular activities. [3]\nBut some laws that may appear to establish certain religious practices are allowed. For example, the courts have permitted religiously inspired\nblue laws\nthat limit working hours or even shutter businesses on Sunday, the Christian day of rest, because by allowing people to practice their (Christian) faith, such rules may help ensure the “health, safety, recreation, and general well-being” of citizens. They have allowed restrictions on the sale of alcohol and sometimes other goods on Sunday for similar reasons.\nThe meaning of the establishment clause has been controversial at times because, as a matter of course, government officials acknowledge that we live in a society with vigorous religious practice where most people believe in God—even if we disagree on what God is. Disputes often arise over how much the government can acknowledge this widespread religious belief. The courts have generally allowed for a certain tolerance of what is described as ceremonial deism, an acknowledgement of God or a creator that generally lacks any substantive religious content. For example, the national motto “In God We Trust,” which appears on our coins and paper money, is seen as more an acknowledgment that most citizens believe in God than any serious effort by government officials to promote religious belief and practice. This reasoning has also been used to permit the inclusion of the phrase “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance—a change that came about during the early years of the Cold War as a means of contrasting the United States with the “godless” Soviet Union.\nIn addition, the courts have allowed some religiously motivated actions by government agencies, such as clergy delivering prayers to open city council meetings and legislative sessions, on the presumption that—unlike school children—adult participants can distinguish between the government’s allowing someone to speak and endorsing that person’s speech. Yet, while some displays of religious codes (e.g., Ten Commandments) are permitted in the context of showing the evolution of law over the centuries, in other cases, these displays have been removed after state supreme court rulings. In Oklahoma, the courts ordered the removal of a Ten Commandments sculpture at the state capitol when other groups, including Satanists and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, attempted to get their own sculptures allowed there.\nFigure 3. The motto “In God We Trust” has appeared intermittently on U.S. coins since the 1860s (a), yet it was not mandated on paper currency until 1957. The Ten Commandments are prominently displayed on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol in Austin (b), though a similar sculpture was ordered to be removed in Oklahoma.

This portion of the First Amendment regulates not the government’s promotion of religion, but rather government suppression of religious beliefs and practices. Much of the controversy surrounding the free exercise clause reflects the way laws or rules that apply to everyone might apply to people with particular religious beliefs. For example, can a Jewish police officer whose religious belief, if followed strictly, requires her to observe Shabbat be compelled to work on a Friday night or during the day on Saturday? Or must the government accommodate this religious practice, even if it means the general law or rule in question is not applied equally to everyone?\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, cases involving Jehovah’s Witnesses demonstrated the difficulty of striking the right balance. In addition to following their church’s teaching that they should not participate in military combat, members refuse to participate in displays of patriotism, including saluting the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and they regularly engage in door-to-door evangelism to recruit converts. These activities have led to frequent conflict with local authorities. Jehovah’s Witness children were punished in public schools for failing to salute the flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance, and members attempting to evangelize were arrested for violating laws against door-to-door solicitation of customers. In early legal challenges brought by Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Supreme Court was reluctant to overturn state and local laws that burdened their religious beliefs. [4] However, in later cases, the court was willing to uphold the rights of Jehovah’s Witnesses to proselytize and refuse to salute the flag or recite the Pledge. [5]\nThe rights of\nconscientious objectors\n—individuals who claim the right to refuse to perform military service on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience, or religion—have also been controversial, although many conscientious objectors have contributed service as non-combatant medics during wartime. To avoid serving in the Vietnam War, many people claimed to have a conscientious objection to military service on the basis that they believed this particular war was unwise or unjust. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Gillette v. United States that to claim to be a conscientious objector, a person must be opposed to serving in any war, not just some wars. [6]\nEstablishing a general framework for deciding whether a religious belief can trump general laws and policies has been a challenge for the Supreme Court. In the 1960s and 1970s, the court decided two cases in which it laid out a general test for deciding similar cases in the future. In both Sherbert v. Verner, a case dealing with unemployment compensation, and Wisconsin v. Yoder, which dealt with the right of Amish parents to homeschool their children, the court said that for a law to be allowed to limit or burden a religious practice, the government must meet two criteria. [7] It must demonstrate both that it had a “compelling governmental interest” in limiting that practice and that the restriction was “narrowly tailored.” In other words, it must show there was a very good reason for the law in question and that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal. This standard became known as the\nSherbert test\n. Since the burden of proof in these cases was on the government, the Supreme Court made it very difficult for the federal and state governments to enforce laws against individuals that would infringe upon their religious beliefs.\nIn 1990, the Supreme Court made a controversial decision substantially narrowing the Sherbert test in Employment Division v. Smith, more popularly known as “the peyote case.” [8] This case involved two men who were members of the Native American Church, a religious organization that uses the hallucinogenic peyote plant as part of its sacraments. After being arrested for possession of peyote, the two men were fired from their jobs as counselors at a private drug rehabilitation clinic. When they applied for unemployment benefits, the state refused to pay on the basis that they had been dismissed for work-related reasons. The men appealed the denial of benefits and were initially successful, since the state courts applied the Sherbert test and found that the denial of unemployment benefits burdened their religious beliefs. However, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6–3 decision that the “compelling governmental interest” standard should not apply; instead, so long as the law was not designed to target a person’s religious beliefs in particular, it was not up to the courts to decide that those beliefs were more important than the law in question.\nOn the surface, a case involving the Native American Church seems unlikely to arouse much controversy. But because it replaced the Sherbert test with one that allowed more government regulation of religious practices, followers of other religious traditions grew concerned that state and local laws, even ones neutral on their face, might be used to curtail their religious practices. In 1993, in response to this decision, Congress passed a law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which was followed in 2000 by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act after part of the RFRA was struck down by the Supreme Court. In addition, since 1990, twenty-one states have passed state RFRAs that include the Sherbert test in state law, and state court decisions in eleven states have enshrined the Sherbert test’s compelling governmental interest interpretation of the free exercise clause into state law. [9]\nHowever, the RFRA itself has not been without its critics. While it has been relatively uncontroversial as applied to the rights of individuals, debate has emerged about whether businesses and other groups can be said to have religious liberty. In explicitly religious organizations, such as a fundamentalist congregation (fundamentalists adhere very strictly to biblical absolutes) or the Roman Catholic Church, it is fairly obvious members have a meaningful, shared religious belief. But the application of the RFRA has become more problematic in businesses and non-profit organizations whose owners or organizers may share a religious belief while the organization has some secular, non-religious purpose.\nSuch a conflict emerged in the 2014 Supreme Court case known as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby.[10] The Hobby Lobby chain of stores sells arts and crafts merchandise at hundreds of stores; its founder, David Green, is a devout fundamentalist Christian whose beliefs include opposition to abortion and contraception. Consistent with these beliefs, he used his business to object to a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare) requiring employer-backed insurance plans to include no-charge access to the morning-after pill, a form of emergency contraception, arguing that this requirement infringed on his conscience. Based in part on the federal RFRA, the Supreme Court agreed 5–4 with Green and Hobby Lobby’s position and said that Hobby Lobby and other closely held businesses did not have to provide employees free access to emergency contraception or other birth control if doing so would violate the religious beliefs of the business’ owners, because there were other less restrictive ways the government could ensure access to these services for Hobby Lobby’s employees (e.g., paying for them directly).\nIn 2015, state RFRAs became controversial when individuals and businesses that provided wedding services (e.g., catering and photography) were compelled to provide these for same-sex weddings in states where the practice had been newly legalized. Proponents of state RFRA laws argued that people and businesses ought not be compelled to endorse practices their religious beliefs held to be immoral or indecent and feared clergy might be compelled to officiate same-sex marriages against their religion’s teachings. Opponents of RFRA laws argued that individuals and businesses should be required, per Obergefell v. Hodges, to serve same-sex marriages on an equal basis as a matter of ensuring the civil rights of gays and lesbians, just as they would be obliged to cater or photograph an interracial marriage. [11]\nFigure 4. One of the most recent notorious cases related to the free exercise clause involved an Oregon bakery whose owners refused to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple in January 2013, citing the owners’ religious beliefs. The couple was eventually awarded $135,000 in damages as a result of the ongoing dispute. However, in a similar case, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the baker’s rights.(credit: modification of work by Bev Sykes)\nDespite ongoing controversy, however, the courts have consistently found some public interests sufficiently compelling to override the free exercise clause. For example, since the late nineteenth century, the courts have consistently held that people’s religious beliefs do not exempt them from the general laws against polygamy. Other potential acts in the name of religion that are also out of the question are drug use and human sacrifice.\nFreedom of Expression\nAlthough the remainder of the First Amendment protects four distinct rights—free speech, press, assembly, and petition—we generally think of these rights today as encompassing a right to freedom of expression, particularly since the world’s technological evolution has blurred the lines between oral and written communication (i.e., speech and press) in the centuries since the First Amendment was written and adopted.\nControversies over freedom of expression were rare until the 1900s, even though government censorship was quite common. For example, during the Civil War, the Union post office refused to deliver newspapers that opposed the war or sympathized with the Confederacy, while allowing pro-war newspapers to be mailed. The emergence of photography and movies, in particular, led to new public concerns about morality, causing both state and federal politicians to censor lewd and otherwise improper content. At the same time, writers became more ambitious in their subject matter by including explicit references to sex and using obscene language, leading to government censorship of books and magazines.\nCensorship reached its height during World War I. The United States was swept up in two waves of hysteria. Anti-German feeling was provoked by the actions of Germany and its allies leading up to the war, including the sinking of the RMS Lusitania and the Zimmerman Telegram, an effort by the Germans to conclude an alliance with Mexico against the United States. This concern was compounded in 1917 by the Bolshevik revolution against the more moderate interim government of Russia; the leaders of the Bolsheviks, most notably Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Joseph Stalin, withdrew from the war against Germany and called for communist revolutionaries to overthrow the capitalist, democratic governments in western Europe and North America.\nAmericans who vocally supported the communist cause or opposed the war often found themselves in jail. In Schenck v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that people encouraging young men to dodge the draft could be imprisoned for doing so, arguing that recommending that people disobey the law was tantamount to “falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic” and thus presented a “clear and present danger” to public order. [12] Similarly, communists and other revolutionary anarchists and socialists during the Red Scare after the war were prosecuted under various state and federal laws for supporting the forceful or violent overthrow of government. This general approach to political speech remained in place for the next fifty years.\nIn the 1960s, however, the Supreme Court’s rulings on free expression became more liberal, in response to the Vietnam War and the growing antiwar movement. In a 1969 case involving the Ku Klux Klan, Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court found that only speech or writing that constituted a direct call or plan to imminent lawless action, an illegal act in the immediate future, could be suppressed; the mere advocacy of a hypothetical revolution was not enough. [13] The Supreme Court also found that various forms of\nsymbolic speech\n—wearing clothing like an armband that carried a political symbol or raising a fist in the air, for example—were subject to the same protections as written and spoken communication.\n*Watch this video to learn more about freedom of the press.\nFreedom of the Press: Crash Course Government and Politics #26\nWatch later\nWatch on\nMILESTONE\nBurning the U.S. Flag\nPerhaps no act of symbolic speech has been as controversial in U.S. history as the burning of the flag. Citizens tend to revere the flag as a unifying symbol of the country in much the same way most people in Britain would treat the reigning queen (or king). States and the federal government have long had laws protecting the flag from being desecrated—defaced, damaged, or otherwise treated with disrespect. Perhaps in part because of these laws, people who have wanted to drive home a point in opposition to U.S. government policies have found desecrating the flag a useful way to gain public and press attention to their cause.\nFigure 5. On the eve of the 2008 election, a U.S. flag was burned in protest in New Hampshire. (credit: modification of work by Jennifer Parr)\nOne such person was Gregory Lee Johnson, a member of various pro-communist and antiwar groups. In 1984, as part of a protest near the Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas, Johnson set fire to a U.S. flag that another protestor had torn from a flagpole. He was arrested, charged with “desecration of a venerated object” (among other offenses), and eventually convicted of that offense. However, in 1989, the Supreme Court decided in Texas v. Johnson that burning the flag was a form of symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment and found the law, as applied to flag desecration, to be unconstitutional. [14]\nThis court decision was strongly criticized, and Congress responded by passing a federal law, the Flag Protection Act, intended to overrule it; the act, too, was struck down as unconstitutional in 1990. [15] Since then, Congress has attempted on several occasions to propose constitutional amendments allowing the states and federal government to re-criminalize flag desecration—to no avail.\nShould we amend the Constitution to allow Congress or the states to pass laws protecting the U.S. flag from desecration? Should we protect other symbols as well? Why or why not?\nFreedom of the press is an important component of the right to free expression as well. In Near v. Minnesota, an early case regarding press freedoms, the Supreme Court ruled that the government generally could not engage in\nprior restraint\n; that is, states and the federal government could not in advance prohibit someone from publishing something without a very compelling reason. [16] This standard was reinforced in 1971 in the Pentagon Papers case, in which the Supreme Court found that the government could not prohibit the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers from publishing the Pentagon Papers. [17] These papers included materials from a secret history of the Vietnam War that had been compiled by the military. More specifically, the papers were compiled at the request of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and provided a study of U.S. political and military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967. Daniel Ellsberg famously released passages of the Papers to the press to show that the United States had secretly enlarged the scope of the war by bombing Cambodia and Laos among other deeds while lying to the American public about doing so.\nAlthough people who leak secret information to the media can still be prosecuted and punished, this does not generally extend to reporters and news outlets that pass that information on to the public. The Edward Snowden case is another good case in point. Snowden himself, rather than those involved in promoting the information that he shared, is the object of criminal prosecution.\nFurthermore, the courts have recognized that government officials and other public figures might try to silence press criticism and avoid unfavorable news coverage by threatening a lawsuit for defamation of character. In the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, the Supreme Court decided that public figures needed to demonstrate not only that a negative press statement about them was untrue but also that the statement was published or made with either malicious intent or “reckless disregard” for the truth. [18] This ruling made it much harder for politicians to silence potential critics or to bankrupt their political opponents through the courts.\nThe right to freedom of expression is not absolute; several key restrictions limit our ability to speak or publish opinions under certain circumstances. We have seen that the Constitution protects most forms of offensive and unpopular expression, particularly political speech; however, incitement of a criminal act, “fighting words,” and genuine threats are not protected. So, for example, you can’t point at someone in front of an angry crowd and shout, “Let’s beat up that guy!” And the Supreme Court has allowed laws that ban threatening symbolic speech, such as burning a cross on the lawn of an African American family’s home. [19] Finally, as we’ve just seen, defamation of character—whether in written form (libel) or spoken form (slander)—is not protected by the First Amendment, so people who are subject to false accusations can sue to recover damages, although criminal prosecutions of libel and slander are uncommon.\nFigure 6. The Supreme Court has allowed laws that ban threatening symbolic speech, such as burning crosses on the lawns of African American families, an intimidation tactic used by the Ku Klux Klan, pictured here at a meeting in Gainesville, Florida, on December 31, 1922.\nAnother key exception to the right to freedom of expression is\nobscenity\n, acts or statements that are extremely offensive under current societal standards. Defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity, having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building, “I know it when I see it.” Into the early twentieth century, written work was frequently banned as being obscene, including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller, although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone. In 1973, the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene: “(a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.” [20] However, the application of this standard has at times been problematic. In particular, the concept of “contemporary community standards” raises the possibility that obscenity varies from place to place; many people in New York or San Francisco might not bat an eye at something people in Memphis or Salt Lake City would consider offensive. The one form of obscenity that has been banned almost without challenge is child pornography, although even in this area the courts have found exceptions.\nThe courts have allowed censorship of less-than-obscene content when it is broadcast over the airwaves, particularly when it is available for anyone to receive. In general, these restrictions on indecency—a quality of acts or statements that offend societal norms or may be harmful to minors—apply only to radio and television programming broadcast when children might be in the audience, although most cable and satellite channels follow similar standards for commercial reasons. An infamous case of televised indecency occurred during the halftime show of the 2004 Super Bowl, during a performance by singer Janet Jackson in which a part of her clothing was removed by fellow performer Justin Timberlake, revealing her right breast. The network responsible for the broadcast, CBS, was ultimately presented with a fine of $550,000 by the Federal Communications Commission, the government agency that regulates television broadcasting. However, CBS was not ultimately required to pay.\nOn the other hand, in 1997, the NBC network showed a broadcast of Schindler’s List, a film depicting events during the Holocaust in Nazi Germany, without any editing, so it included graphic nudity and depictions of violence. NBC was not fined or otherwise punished, suggesting there is no uniform standard for indecency. Similarly, in the 1990s Congress compelled television broadcasters to implement a television ratings system, enforced by a “V-Chip” in televisions and cable boxes, so parents could better control the television programming their children might watch. However, similar efforts to regulate indecent content on the Internet to protect children from pornography have largely been struck down as unconstitutional. This outcome suggests that technology has created new avenues for obscene material to be disseminated. The Children’s Internet Protection Act, however, requires K–12 schools and public libraries receiving Internet access using special E-rate discounts to filter or block access to obscene material and other material deemed harmful to minors, with certain exceptions.\nThe courts have also allowed laws that forbid or compel certain forms of expression by businesses, such as laws that require the disclosure of nutritional information on food and beverage containers and warning labels on tobacco products. The federal government requires the prices advertised for airline tickets to include all taxes and fees. Many states regulate advertising by lawyers. And, in general, false or misleading statements made in connection with a commercial transaction can be illegal if they constitute fraud.\nFigure 7. The surgeon general’s warning label on a box of cigarettes is mandated by the Food and Drug Administration. The United States was the first nation to require a health warning on cigarette packages. (credit: Debora Cartagena, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\nFurthermore, the courts have ruled that, although public school officials are government actors, the First Amendment freedom of expression rights of children attending public schools are somewhat limited. In particular, in Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) and Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier (1988), the Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on speech that creates “substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others” [21] or is “reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.” [22] For example, the content of school-sponsored activities like school newspapers and speeches delivered by students can be controlled, either for the purposes of instructing students in proper adult behavior or to deter conflict between students.\nFree expression includes the right to assemble peaceably and the right to petition government officials. This right even extends to members of groups whose views most people find abhorrent, such as American Nazis and the vehemently anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church, whose members have become known for their protests at the funerals of U.S. soldiers who have died fighting in the war on terror. [23] Free expression—although a broad right—is subject to certain constraints to balance it against the interests of public order. In particular, the nature, place, and timing of protests—but not their substantive content—are subject to reasonable limits. The courts have ruled that while people may peaceably assemble in a place that is a public forum, not all public property is a public forum. For example, the inside of a government office building or a college classroom—particularly while someone is teaching—is not generally considered a public forum.\nFigure 8. Protesters from Westboro Baptist Church picket outside the U.S. Supreme Court in July 2014 prior to the decision ruling that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is unconstitutional. (credit: Jordan Uhl)\nRallies and protests on land that has other dedicated uses, such as roads and highways, can be limited to groups that have secured a permit in advance, and those organizing large gatherings may be required to give sufficient notice so government authorities can ensure there is enough security available. However, any such regulation must be viewpoint-neutral; the government may not treat one group differently than another because of its opinions or beliefs. For example, the government can’t permit a rally by a group that favors a government policy but forbid opponents from staging a similar rally. Finally, there have been controversial situations in which government agencies have established free-speech zones for protesters during political conventions, presidential visits, and international meetings in areas that are arguably selected to minimize their public audience or to ensure that the subjects of the protests do not have to encounter the protesters.\nTHE SECOND AMENDMENT\nThere has been increased conflict over the Second Amendment in recent years due to school shootings and gun violence. As a result, gun rights have become a highly charged political issue. The text of the Second Amendment is among the shortest of those included in the Constitution:\n“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”\nBut the relative simplicity of its text has not kept it from controversy; arguably, the Second Amendment has become controversial in large part because of its text. Is this amendment merely a protection of the right of the states to organize and arm a “well regulated militia” for civil defense, or is it a protection of a “right of the people” as a whole to individually bear arms?\nBefore the Civil War, this would have been a nearly meaningless distinction. In most states at that time, white males of military age were considered part of the militia, liable to be called for service to put down rebellions or invasions, and the right “to keep and bear Arms” was considered a\ncommon-law right\ninherited from English law that predated the federal and state constitutions. The Constitution was not seen as a limitation on state power, and since the states expected all able-bodied free men to keep arms as a matter of course, what gun control there was mostly revolved around ensuring slaves (and their abolitionist allies) didn’t have guns.\nWith the beginning of selective incorporation after the Civil War, debates over the Second Amendment were reinvigorated. In the meantime, as part of their black codes designed to reintroduce most of the trappings of slavery, several southern states adopted laws that restricted the carrying and ownership of weapons by former slaves. Despite acknowledging a common-law individual right to keep and bear arms, in 1876 the Supreme Court declined, in United States v. Cruickshank, to intervene to ensure the states would respect it. [24]\nIn the following decades, states gradually began to introduce laws to regulate gun ownership. Federal gun control laws began to be introduced in the 1930s in response to organized crime, with stricter laws that regulated most commerce and trade in guns coming into force in the wake of the street protests of the 1960s. In the early 1980s, following an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, laws requiring background checks for prospective gun buyers were passed. During this period, the Supreme Court’s decisions regarding the meaning of the Second Amendment were ambiguous at best. In United States v. Miller, the Supreme Court upheld the 1934 National Firearms Act’s prohibition of sawed-off shotguns, largely on the basis that possession of such a gun was not related to the goal of promoting a “well regulated militia.” [25] This finding was generally interpreted as meaning that the Second Amendment protected the right of the states to organize a militia, rather than an individual right, and thus lower courts generally found most firearm regulations—including some city and state laws that virtually outlawed the private ownership of firearms—to be constitutional.\nHowever, in 2008, in a narrow 5–4 decision on District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court found that at least some gun control laws did violate the Second Amendment and that this amendment does protect an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, at least in some circumstances—in particular, “for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.” [26] Because the District of Columbia is not a state, this decision immediately applied the right only to the federal government and territorial governments. Two years later, in McDonald v. Chicago, the Supreme Court overturned the Cruickshank decision (5–4) and again found that the right to bear arms was a fundamental right incorporated against the states, meaning that state regulation of firearms might, in some circumstances, be unconstitutional. In 2015, however, the Supreme Court allowed several of San Francisco’s strict gun control laws to remain in place, suggesting that—as in the case of rights protected by the First Amendment—the courts will not treat gun rights as absolute. [27] Elsewhere in the political system, the gun issue remains similarly unsettled. However, in the wake of especially traumatic shootings at a Las Vegas outdoor concert and at a school in Parkland, Florida, there has been increased activism around gun control and community safety, especially among the young. [28]\nFigure 9. A “No Firearms” sign is posted at Binghamton Park in Memphis, Tennessee, demonstrating that the right to possess a gun is not absolute. (credit: modification of work by Thomas R Machnitzki)\nTHE THIRD AMENDMENT\nThe Third Amendment says in full:\n“No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.”\nMost people consider this provision of the Constitution obsolete and unimportant. However, it is worthwhile to note its relevance in the context of the time: citizens remembered having their cities and towns occupied by British soldiers and mercenaries during the Revolutionary War, and they viewed the British laws that required the colonists to house soldiers particularly offensive, to the point that it had been among the grievances listed in the Declaration of Independence.\nToday it seems unlikely the federal government would need to house military forces in civilian lodgings against the will of property owners or tenants; however, perhaps in the same way we consider the Second and Fourth amendments, we can think of the Third Amendment as reflecting a broader idea that our homes lie within a “zone of privacy” that government officials should not violate unless absolutely necessary.\nTHE FOURTH AMENDMENT\n*Watch this video to learn more about search and seizure as it relates to the Fourth Amendment.\nSearch and Seizure: Crash Course Government and Politics #27\nWatch later\nWatch on\nThe Fourth Amendment sits at the boundary between general individual freedoms and the rights of those suspected of crimes. We saw earlier that perhaps it reflects James Madison’s broader concern about establishing an expectation of privacy from government intrusion at home. Another way to think of the Fourth Amendment is that it protects us from overzealous efforts by law enforcement to root out crime by ensuring that police have good reason before they intrude on people’s lives with criminal investigations.\nThe text of the Fourth Amendment is as follows:\n“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”\nThe amendment places limits on both searches and seizures: Searches are efforts to locate documents and contraband. Seizures are the taking of these items by the government for use as evidence in a criminal prosecution (or, in the case of a person, the detention or taking of the person into custody).\nIn either case, the amendment indicates that government officials are required to apply for and receive a\nsearch warrant\nprior to a search or seizure; this warrant is a legal document, signed by a judge, allowing police to search and/or seize persons or property. Since the 1960s, however, the Supreme Court has issued a series of rulings limiting the warrant requirement in situations where a person can be said to lack a “reasonable expectation of privacy” outside the home. Police can also search and/or seize people or property without a warrant if the owner or renter consents to the search, if there is a reasonable expectation that evidence may be destroyed or tampered with before a warrant can be issued (i.e., exigent circumstances), or if the items in question are in plain view of government officials.\nFurthermore, the courts have found that police do not generally need a warrant to search the passenger compartment of a car, or to search people entering the United States from another country. [29] When a warrant is needed, law enforcement officers do not need enough evidence to secure a conviction, but they must demonstrate to a judge that there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed or evidence will be found.\nProbable cause\nis the legal standard for determining whether a search or seizure is constitutional or a crime has been committed; it is a lower threshold than the standard of proof at a criminal trial.\nCritics have argued that this requirement is not very meaningful because law enforcement officers are almost always able to get a search warrant when they request one; on the other hand, since we wouldn’t expect the police to waste their time or a judge’s time trying to get search warrants that are unlikely to be granted, perhaps the high rate at which they get them should not be so surprising.\nFigure 10. A state police officer conducting a traffic stop near Walla Walla, Washington. (credit: modification of work by Richard Bauer)\nWhat happens if the police conduct an illegal search or seizure without a warrant and find evidence of a crime? In the 1961 Supreme Court case Mapp v. Ohio, the court decided that evidence obtained without a warrant that didn’t fall under one of the exceptions mentioned above could not be used as evidence in a state criminal trial, giving rise to the broad application of what is known as the\nexclusionary rule\n, which was first established in 1914 on a federal level in Weeks v. United States.[30] The exclusionary rule doesn’t just apply to evidence found or to items or people seized without a warrant (or falling under an exception noted above); it also applies to any evidence developed or discovered as a result of the illegal search or seizure.\nFor example, if police search your home without a warrant, find bank statements showing large cash deposits on a regular basis, and discover you are engaged in some other crime in which they were previously unaware (e.g., blackmail, drugs, or prostitution), not only can they not use the bank statements as evidence of criminal activity—they also can’t prosecute you for the crimes they discovered during the illegal search. This extension of the exclusionary rule is sometimes called the “fruit of the poisonous tree,” because just as the metaphorical tree (i.e., the original search or seizure) is poisoned, so is anything that grows out of it. [31]\nHowever, like the requirement for a search warrant, the exclusionary rule does have exceptions. The courts have allowed evidence to be used that was obtained without the necessary legal procedures in circumstances where police executed warrants they believed were correctly granted but in fact were not (“good faith” exception), and when the evidence would have been found anyway had they followed the law (“inevitable discovery”).\nThe requirement of probable cause also applies to arrest warrants. A person cannot generally be detained by police or taken into custody without a warrant, although most states allow police to arrest someone suspected of a felony crime without a warrant so long as probable cause exists, and police can arrest people for minor crimes or misdemeanors they have witnessed themselves.\nCHAPTER REVIEW\nSee the Chapter 4.2 Review for a summary of this section, the key vocabulary, and some review questions to check your knowledge.\nLemon v.

This article describes what we know about four of the most controversial provisions three years after their enactment, including attempts to litigate their constitutionality. The real problem with these provisions is that they reveal a divergence between constitutional values and constitutional law. The courts are unlikely to find much about the surveillance provisions violative of the Fourth Amendment, which the Supreme Court has interpreted in a manner that is distinctly submajoritarian. The role of the courts in this national debate has also been minimized because litigation of the constitutionality of these provisions has been delayed and distorted by the secrecy surrounding their implementation and executive branch control of the course of litigation. Some argue that we should not be troubled by this minimization of judicial role because Congress is better suited to deciding when searches and seizures are reasonable. This article contends that the Court should revise its Fourth Amendment doctrine to make Congress its partner instead of its rival in providing a check on executive discretion to search and seize. Because the Supreme Court is not likely to restore the judicial role in this area any time soon, Congress should ask more searching questions about the Patriot Act than whether it is constitutional.\nNo full-text available\n...

It's mostly seen as criminal procedure, and it usually comes up in court when a criminal defendant claims the police did an illegal search and/or seizure. That means, most of our 4th Amendment law is made in cases where someone (probably) did a crime, but the police (theoretically) violated their rights in finding the evidence.\nThe Patriot Act survived because of the confluence of several factors:\nWhen 911 happened, the 4th Amendment was already pretty weak (which wasn't clear to those unfamiliar with criminal procedure, but google \"stop & frisk\" or \"Terry stop,\" for context.)\nmost people had no idea how much surveillance was even possible at the time.

{"query_id": "72", "generated_response": "# Understanding Deforestation: A Major Environmental Crisis\n\nDeforestation is indeed a critical global problem with far-reaching consequences. Let me break down its impacts and causes comprehensively.\n\n## What is Deforestation?\n\nDeforestation is the permanent removal of forests and conversion of forested land to non-forest uses, such as agriculture, urban development, or industrial purposes [2]. Currently, we're losing approximately 1.5 hectares of forest per minute [4].\n\n## Major Causes of Deforestation\n\n### Human Activities (Primary Drivers)\n- **Agriculture**: Accounts for 48% of deforestation (subsistence farming) and 32% (commercial agriculture), particularly for cattle ranching and crop production [2]\n- **Logging**: For timber, paper production, furniture, and fuel [2][3]\n- **Palm oil production**: Forests cleared for palm oil cultivation used in cosmetics, food, and fuel [4]\n- **Urban development**: Population growth requiring more housing and infrastructure [2]\n- **Mining**: Coal and oil extraction requiring forest clearing [2]\n\n### Natural Causes\n- Forest fires, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, droughts, and disease [3]\n\n## Environmental and Climate Impacts\n\n### Climate Change Effects\nForests act as crucial carbon sinks, and their destruction has severe climate consequences [1][2]:\n- **Carbon release**: Trees store carbon, and when burned or decomposed, they release CO₂ into the atmosphere [1]\n- **Reduced carbon absorption**: Loss of forests means less CO₂ being absorbed from the atmosphere [2]\n- **Temperature increases**: Deforestation contributes to global warming, with the Amazon experiencing severe droughts as a result [1]\n\n### Water Cycle Disruption\n- Trees help regulate atmospheric moisture through their roots and transpiration [2][5]\n- Deforestation leads to drier climates and reduced rainfall [5]\n- The Amazon releases 20 billion tons of moisture daily into the atmosphere [5]\n\n### Soil and Erosion Problems\n- **Soil erosion**: Without tree roots to hold soil in place, erosion increases dramatically during rain [1][2]\n- **Flooding**: Loss of natural water storage increases flood vulnerability [2]\n- **Desertification**: Soil becomes less fertile and more desert-like [3]\n\n## Impact on Animals and Biodiversity\n\nThe effects on wildlife are devastating [2][5]:\n- **Habitat loss**: 70% of land animals and plant species live in forests [6]\n- **Species extinction**: An estimated 100,000 species become extinct yearly in tropical forests [5]\n- **Disrupted migration**: Fragmented forest patches prevent normal animal movement [5]\n- **Food source loss**: Animals lose their natural food sources and shelter [2]\n\nAbout 80% of the world's biodiversity is located in tropical rainforests, making their protection critical [2].\n\n## Human Impacts\n\n### Indigenous Communities\nDeforestation severely affects indigenous peoples [1][2][6]:\n- **Loss of homeland**: Tribes lose their traditional living spaces and way of life\n- **Cultural disruption**: Forced integration into societies where they may not speak the language\n- **Loss of traditional medicine**: Medicinal plants are destroyed along with forests\n- **Economic displacement**: People who depend on forests for their livelihood are affected\n\n### Broader Human Consequences\n- **Loss of potential medical discoveries**: Many disease cures come from rainforest plants [4]\n- **Economic impacts**: While profitable for some farmers short-term, the long-term costs affect everyone\n- **Food security**: Soil degradation makes future agriculture more difficult\n\n## Amazon Rainforest Specific Effects\n\nThe Amazon faces particular challenges [5]:\n- **Reduced rainfall**: The forest creates its own weather patterns\n- **Increased fire risk**: Drier conditions lead to more wildfires\n- **Biodiversity loss**: Home to an enormous variety of species\n- **Temperature increases**: More sunlight penetrates to the forest floor\n- **Soil degradation**: Amazon soil is naturally thin and depends on forest cover\n\n## Solutions and Prevention\n\n### Individual Actions\n- **Reduce paper consumption**: Use less paper, recycle, buy second-hand books [4]\n- **Avoid palm oil products**: Check ingredients in food and cosmetics [4]\n- **Choose sustainable wood products**: Repair rather than replace wooden items [4]\n- **Support reforestation projects**: Donate to organizations fighting deforestation [3]\n\n### Systemic Solutions\n- **Government regulations**: Strict controls on forest clearing with preservation requirements [2]\n- **Farmer incentives**: Subsidize farmers to preserve rather than clear forests [2]\n- **International cooperation**: Support organizations like WWF, IUCN, and reforestation campaigns [3]\n- **Education**: Teach about forest importance starting in elementary school [2]\n\n### Large-Scale Initiatives\n- **Reforestation and afforestation**: Planting new trees in cleared and previously unforested areas [2]\n- **Certification programs**: Promoting responsible forest management practices [3]\n- **International funding**: Projects like the Amazon Fund to monitor and prevent deforestation [2]\n\n## The Urgency of Action\n\nThe scale of this problem is enormous - the Amazon alone has an island the size of Switzerland at its mouth [1]. Without immediate action, projections suggest we could lose our remaining tropical forests within a century [4]. The interconnected nature of these effects means that stopping deforestation is crucial not just for environmental protection, but for human survival and the preservation of countless species that share our planet.", "citations": ["https://fightingthebiocrisis.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/what-are-the-effects-of-deforestation-in-the-amazon/", "https://environmental-conscience.com/causes-effects-solutions-for-deforestation/\n", "https://www.fasttreeremovalatlanta.com/deforestation-causes-effects-solutions", "https://imp.center/i/essay-on-deforestation-causes-effects-and-solutions-6569/", "https://amazonaid.org/resources/about-the-amazon/effects-of-deforestation-on-the-amazon/\n", "https://lankahousewares.com/effects-of-deforestation/"], "contexts": ["What are the effects of deforestation in the Amazon?  | Fighting The Biocrisis\n← Previous Next →\nWhat are the effects of deforestation in the Amazon?\nPosted on December 5, 2013 by gracedickins\nDeforestation is far more widespread than just the Amazon. This image shows its effect on the landscape in Madagascar.\nI have already covered the causes of deforestation in the Amazon in a previous post, so here I shall cover its effects. The main effect of deforestation you hear about is climate change, but there are many others. Below I briefly outline the main effects, but don’t forget they aren’t mutually exclusive. At the bottom of this post you will find links where you can read more around each of the points if you are interested.\n1. Climate change.\nRainforests act as sinks for carbon, and with their destruction they can turn into carbon sources as the trees are burnt and plants decompose. 1 A reduced sink for carbon, means an increase in carbon in the atmosphere contributing to climate change and global warming. The Amazon is actually experiencing droughts due to the warming. 2010 was a severe drought year, with much forest dying back and the Amazon becoming a net emitter of carbon dioxide. 2 In the warmer, drier climate trees struggle to take up as much. 3 Rainforests can also take up a miriad of other greenhouse gases. They fully deserve being called the ‘lungs of the Earth’.\n2. Soil erosion.\nThe removal of trees means there are no longer roots to hold the soil in place. The first instance there is rain, which funnily enough is a very common occurrence in a rainforest, it starts to wash the soil away downstream. Consequently as there are few or no plants to absorb the water, there is more surface run-off which increases the chance of flooding.\nThe left stream is full of sediment as a consequence of soil erosion. The right stream is how it should look.\n3. Loss of biodiversity.\nWith the loss of trees comes the loss of the plants that live below its canopy, and all the animals that depend on it to survive. This is no small number as rainforests are one of the most biodiverse places on Earth with new species constantly being found. By destroying these rainforests we could in fact be destroying as yet unknown cures for illnesses. Projections suggest that 5–18% of endemic (i.e. occur nowhere else) mammal species will be extinct by 2020. 4 This may have a cascade effect where these species underpin the ecosystem, directly causing the extinction of further species. Do we even have the right to deprive a species of the right to survive?\n4. Water table disruption.\nThe removal of trees leads to reduced water retention in the soil, lowering the water table. This leads to dry and less fertile soils, making it hard to grow crops. Therefore the people who have deforested the land to farm, end up with pretty rubbish growing conditions. In fact the more they farm, the less fertile the soil becomes, however that shall be covered in the next post on the Amazon.\n5. Loss of culture and land by indigenous people.\nIndigenous people often don’t have any official rights to their land, therefore the government has no qualms about selling it, for example, to oil companies. 5 This obviously is a contravention to their human rights, but all the government wants is money. 6 They simply don’t care about the people who lived their first. Without changes the sale of land for oil will be disastrous for the indigenous people. 7 The destruction of the forest takes away their home, they are forced to integrate into a society where they more than likely don’t speak the language, and hence can swiftly lose their traditions. Medicinal plants they use may also be destroyed along with the forest, and there are loads left for us to discover, or at least there are at the moment! 8 In fact the government should be thanking these people, as they are actually the reason why the Amazon is so fertile (again to be explained in my next post).\nIndigenous people using their bodies to help raise awareness of how bad the situation is in the Amazon. Source: Amazon Watch\nOne of the big reasons I think most of the world is in denial a bout deforestation, is you have to see it to believe it. To get a sense of scale of the problem, the mouth of the Amazon alone has an island the size of Switzerland in it. 9\nI know that this subject can be a somewhat depressing one, so I will leave you with an inspiring TED talk by Willie Smits discussing how we can restore rainforests.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vfuCPFb8wk\nThe next post will be on terra preta, the reason why the Amazon soil is so fertile.\nSources:\n1. http://thepimmgroup.org/1108/amazon-rainforest-turning-from-a-carbon-sink-to-a-source-of-carbon/\n2. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12356835\n3. http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/4547/20131022/climate-change-inhibiting-amazon-rainforests-ability-absorb-greenhouse-gases-study.htm\n4. http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=5320E0ADC4D17F73F1A9767D5655AB08.journals?fromPage=online&aid=323901\n5. http://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2013/jun/07/peruvians-protest-oil-company-land-petroperu\n6. http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/29/brazil-indigenous-people-violates-rights\n7. http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0002932\n8. http://atlanticrising.org/classroom/rainforests.asp\n9. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130520154301.htm\nShare this:\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nFacebook\nTumblr\nLoading...", "21 Causes, Effects and Solutions for Deforestation - E&C\n21 Causes, Effects and Solutions for Deforestation\n“ Burn the forests if you will, but you will only scorch your own lungs.”\nAnthony T. Hincks\nDeforestation: Causes, Effects & Solutions\nDeforestation can be defined as the removal of a forest with the purpose of converting this land into non-forest use.\nAfter deforestation, the land can now be used for ranches, farms or also for urban purposes.\nThere are several harmful effects of deforestation on the environmental system.\nNow Playing\nStop Food Speculation!\nUp Next Renewable Energies are the Future!\n0:08\nAppreciate our Planet!\n0:21\nProtect our Oceans!\n0:36\nProtect our Rainforests!\n0:06\nReduce Waste!\n0:26\nStop Food Speculation!\nFor example, deforestation can cause a loss in biodiversity and can also indirectly contribute to the global warming problem.\nThus, it is crucial to preserve our forests, especially the rainforest.\nIn the following, the causes, effects as well as solutions to the deforestation problem will be examined.\nClimate 101: Deforestation | National Geographic\nWatch on\nAudio Lesson\nDeforestation: Causes, Effects & Solutions (Audio Lesson)\nWatch on\nContents\nCauses for Deforestation\nAgriculture\nLogging\nDesertification\nUrbanization\nForest fires\nMining\nAgriculture\nOne of the main reasons for deforestation is the worldwide increasing demand for meat and plants.\nAccording to the UNFCCC, subsistence farming accounts for 48% of deforestation and commercial agriculture is responsible for 32%.\nFarmers will often be able to earn much more by cutting down the trees and transforming the land into farmland than by conserving the forest.\nThus, farmers will even be tempted to burn down the forest in order to be able to monetize it.\nThis problem is especially prevalent in the rainforest.\nEach year, there are several wildfires caused by humans who want to have more land for farming activities.\nLogging\nLogging is another big reason for deforestation.\nWe need wood for many different purposes in our daily lives.\nAmong others, it is used for the production of paper, furniture, firewood or also for the production of charcoal.\nThus, in order to meet this demand, it is profitable for landowners to cut down substantial amounts of their forest.\nDesertification\nMany parts of land are used for industrial purposes.\nThese industries often do not care too much about the environment and dump their chemical by-products in rivers and forests which in turn can lead to the contamination and desertification of land.\nDue to the desertification, this land will not be suitable to plant new trees anymore.\nUrbanization\nDue to population growth, more and more space is needed for the building of houses and the related infrastructure.\nThis also includes the construction of roads.\nThus, deforestation is one way to create more settlement space.\nForest Fires\nForest fires can be caused by either human activities or also by nature.\nForest fires can be a huge problem, especially in warm and dry periods of the year.\nLarge areas of forest and even lives can be lost due to uncontrolled wildfires.\nMining\nAnother reason for deforestation is the use of coal and oil mines.\nExploiting these natural resources can be very profitable.\nHowever, in order to do this, large forest areas have to be cut down.\nMoreover, the chemicals used for the extraction of the resources are often dumped into nature which results in contamination of large parts of the ecosystem.\nEffects of Deforestation\nEffects on climate\nEffects on animals\nEffects on humans\nLoss of living space for indigenous tribes\nLoss of biodiversity\nSoil erosion\nHydrological effects\nFloods\nEffects on climate\nDeforestation is a severe cause of global warming since, after fossil fuel combustion, it is the second-largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide.\nCarbon dioxide is produced in the burning of forest biomass and by the decomposition of plant material.\nForests are also a natural carbon sink.\nThrough photosynthesis, plants convert the carbon into sugar and oxygen.\nThe carbon is also stored in plants and trees.\nThus, burning these trees results in a release of carbon dioxide which in turn contributes to the global warming problem.\nEffects on animals\nDeforestation has a significant adverse effect on animals since animals lose their natural habitat.\nThey either have to move in order to find a new home or they will die since they lose their food sources.\nThus, in the worst case, deforestation can even lead to the extinction of certain animals.\nEffects on humans\nHumans are also affected by deforestation in several ways.\nWhile there is an economical upside from deforestation for a small group of farmers, the majority of the world’s population will suffer due to the climate change issue.\nLoss of living space for indigenous tribes\nThere are some areas on our planet where people are still living in peace with their natural environment.\nEspecially in the Amazon Rainforest, there are several tribes that still live a quite original life without our western amenities.\nThese people rely on an intact environmental system since they still make their living from fishing or other nature-related activities.\nHowever, as our greed for more land for housing and infrastructure purposes continues, more and more areas that had previously been used by indigenous people are now used for farming or industrial purposes.\nThis means that large areas of land are cut or burned down in order to get more land for farming purposes to make more money.\nThis also implies that the natural living space for the tribes is destroyed and that they may also lose their home.\nThus, deforestation can adversely impact the living conditions of many people.\nLoss of biodiversity\nDeforestation leads to vast decline in biodiversity.\nIt also causes the extinction of many species. Forests provide habitats for wildlife and also foster medicinal conservation.\nAbout 80% of the world’s biodiversity is located in tropical rainforests.\nThis number shows the importance of the forest as medium to preserve the huge variety of species.\nIt was also found in a study that deforestation also destroys the microbial community which is responsible for the production of clean water, the removal of pollutants and for the recycling of nutrients.\nA study of the Brazilian Amazon predicts that up to 90 percent of predicted extinctions will occur until the next 40 years.\nSoil erosion\nSoil erosion can be another effect of deforestation.\nForests protect the soil from the sun and keep it moist.\nBy removing the trees, the soil is no longer protected and will dry out, which in turn can lead to soil erosion.\nHydrological effects\nDeforestation also affects the water cycle.\nThrough their roots, trees extract groundwater and release it into the atmosphere.\nThe removal of trees thus contributes to a drier climate since it reduces the concentration of atmospheric moisture.\nFloods\nTrees are a natural storage of water.\nThey hold back large amounts of rainwater with their roots.\nWhen the trees are removed, this natural water storage is gone and thus the vulnerability for floods increases dramatically.\nSolutions to the Deforestation Problem\nGovernment regulations\nConvince farmers to avoid deforestation\nReforestation and afforestation\nInternational projects\nChange our consumption behavior\nEducation\nConvince others\nGovernment regulations\nIn order to protect the forests, there have to be strict regulations on how much forest is allowed to be cut down and how much has to be preserved.\nIt is too tempting to cut down the forest and transform it to farmland.\nWithout regulation, the deforestation process will continue until there is not much forest left.\nConvince farmers to avoid deforestation\nFarmers have to be convinced of the huge negative effects of deforestation on humanity.\nSince farmers have a financial incentive for turning their forests into farmland, it should also be considered to subsidize them in a way that they have a financial incentive to protect their forests.\nReforestation and afforestation\nReforestation can be defined as the restocking of existing forests and woodlands that have been depleted, afforestation refers to the planting of trees in areas where there has been no tree cover before.\nThus, either through reforestation or afforestation, another measure to meet the deforestation problem is to plant new trees.\nHowever, it takes a quite long time until the trees have a significant size and impact on the climate.\nInternational projects\nThere are several foundations that relate to the problem of deforestation and try to find solutions.\nFounded in 1972, the Arbor Day Foundation is the largest nonprofit organization dedicated to the planting of trees.\nThe Billion Tree Campaign launched in 2006 also has the goal to plant as many trees as possible.\nAs of 2011, more than 12 billion trees have been planted due to the efforts of this organization.\nAt the end of 2017, the campaign was renamed in “Trillion tree campaign“.\nMoreover, there is a project called the Amazon Fund which has the goal to raise money in order to monitor, combat and prevent deforestation.\nChange our consumption behavior\nSince the industrial revolution period, it is possible for humans to have high consumption levels which have never been possible before in the history of mankind.\nDue to production with the support of machines, we are able to produce large quantities of goods with a low unit price.\nThis seems to be a good thing, but also has severe downsides.\nOne of them is that in order to be able to meet the increasing demand for material goods, more resources have to be extracted.\nMoreover, more farming has to be done in order to meet the increasing demand for meat.\nTo provide all those resources, large areas of forests had been cut down.\nThis problem is especially severe in the Amazon Rainforest where farmers often start wildfires intentionally since they want to get more land for farming purposes since it is more profitable for them.\nTherefore, to be able to stop the problem of deforestation, we have to change our consumption behavior.\nFor instance, this could mean not always buying the newest shit but rather keeping things that are still functional.\nIt could also mean to reduce meat consumption.\nThus, we can contribute in many different ways in our daily life behavior in order to mitigate the issue of deforestation.\nEducation\nEducation is another crucial measure against deforestation and its implied problems for our earth.\nMany people in our nowadays society do not know how important our forests really are for our planet and therefore also for the living quality of their children.\nWe have to make clear that forests are a vital part of the environment and that we have no chance to fight global warming if we continue to cut down large forest areas.\nThis education should start pretty early. It should already be taught in elementary school that we need our forests to survive as a species.\nThis education will likely have even more positive effects.\nSince these educated children will tell their parents about the adverse consequences of deforestation and how we can prevent it, parents are more likely to also pay more attention to their daily behavior.\nMoreover, when the educated children turn into grownups, they are more likely to behave in an environmentally friendly manner than children without this education.\nConvince others\nAs we have already seen, there are several measures that we can take in our daily life in order to prevent deforestation and the implied adverse consequences on the environmental system.\nHowever, our contribution is only one part of the equation.\nFor really making an impact that matters, we have to convince our family, friends or also as many people as possible about the importance of saving our forests from deforestation.\nIf we are able to convince many people, these people will also convince other people, and so on.\nIn this way, we are able to make a huge impact on our society and will make a real contribution in order to mitigate the deforestation issue.\nConclusion\nDeforestation is a big problem for humans and also for the whole ecosystem.\nWhile it is quite profitable for certain small groups like farmers, deforestation is extremely harmful to the planet since it enhances global warming and also leads to the extinction of many species.\nIt also increases the likelihood of floods and other natural disasters.\nThus, we should make sure to stop the deforestation process on a global scale.\nFamers should be encouraged to preserve their forests.\nGovernments have to strictly regulate the amount of deforestation to make sure that enough woodland remains untouched.\nIn conjunction with the other measures mentioned before, planting trees can be a supplementary measure to meet the deforestation problem.\nSources\nhttps://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1112753888/amazon-deforestation-microbial-communities-122512/\nhttp://www.rain-tree.com/facts.htm\nhttp://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/background_publications_htmlpdf/application/pdf/pub_07_financial_flows.pdf\nAbout the author\nMy name is Andreas and my mission is to educate people of all ages about our environmental problems and how everyone can make a contribution to mitigate these issues.\nAs I went to university and got my Master’s degree in Economics, I did plenty of research in the field of Development Economics.\nAfter finishing university, I traveled around the world.

Climate change and global warming are partially driven by ongoing deforestation worldwide, and with no end in sight, we are at a pivotal crossroad capable of altering the future of life on earth.\nfasttreeremovalatlanta.com gathered information on what is causing deforestation, its effects on our planet, and how we can collectively solve this potentially catastrophic problem.\nWhat is Deforestation\nDeforestation, clearcutting, clearance, or clearing is the removal of the trees in a forest or stand of trees from a piece of land, then converted to a non-forest use.\nDeforestation involves converting wooded land to farms, ranches, or urban areas. The majority of deforestation activities benefit the production of soy, beef, palm oil, and other widely popular and lucrative commodities.\nCurrently, the most widespread deforestation is occurring in the Amazon rainforest located in South America.\nWhat Causes Deforestation\nDeforestation occurs deliberately, naturally, or accidentally, and can happen anywhere trees densely populate land. The following are causal examples of deforestation:\n• Volcanic eruptions\n• Hurricanes\n• Avalanches\n• Temperature/Climate change\n• Drought\n• Disease\n• Severe insect infestation\n• Agricultural, residential, commercial, and industrial land development\n• Logging\n• Strip mining\n• Wartime/Human activities\nThese occurrences are dangerous because deforestation is self-perpetuating, and fuels further deforestation. The loss of trees and underbrush allows for flooding, soil erosion, higher temperatures, and desertification to occur more rapidly and exponentially.\nWhile it may seem that natural occurrences are to blame for the majority of tree loss, it is – in fact – human activity that causes the most deforestation worldwide.\nDeforestation Effects\nWhile studies continue on the grave effects of deforestation, there is much that is already known. The following are effects or consequences induced by continued deforestation:\nAtmospheric Effects of Deforestation – Forests are carbon sinks that sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen in its place. The rainforests of South America are responsible for 20% of Earth’s breathable oxygen.\nAs trees are cut down, the carbon dioxide they have sequestered is subsequently released back into the atmosphere, increasing the quantity of greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere.\nAtmospheric Water – Trees help control the level of water found in the atmosphere. As trees are cut down, there is less water in the air to return to the soil. The result of deforestation is dryer soil that eventually will no longer support agriculture or cattle ranching.\nLoss of Habitat – Eighty percent of Earth’s known animal and plant species reside in forests.\nForest trees provide shelter, while the canopy helps regulate light and temperatures. As these trees are removed, temperature variations, increased sunlight, and vulnerability could prove fatal for all forest plant and animal species.\nThis loss of habitat can result in the endangerment or extinction of known species, and more tragically, the loss of unknown species.\nFlooding and Soil Erosion – Underground, tree, shrub, brush, and grassroots all work together to prevent soil erosion. Without trees, precious topsoil erodes and washes away, leaving the land sterile and more prone to flooding.\nSoil erosion on deforested farmland only serves to perpetuate deforestation. As the land can no longer support crop growth or cattle grazing, new land is deforested.\nIndigenous People’s Homeland – While the effects of deforestation in the urban setting are not yet as poignant, the impact on the indigenous tribes of the rainforests are immediate and often catastrophic.\nDeforestation kills plants used for medicine and sustenance, drives away the animals, leaves the indigenous people susceptible to the elements, and violently disrupts their way of life.\nRead more about how trees are vital to our environment at fasttreeremovalatlanta.com/importance-trees-environment\nDeforestation Solutions\nThere are many ways to look at potential solutions for deforestation. The obvious answer is to stop the human activities that are causing it. However, with an increasing population of people comes an increase in demand for the commodities grown on deforested land.\nSo, here is what you can do now to help reverse the effects of deforestation:\nPlant a Tree – Every tree planted and cared for abates the effects of deforestation. You can learn about choosing the right species and planting location at fasttreeremovalatlanta.com/tree-planting-location-landscape-species\nResearch – By learning about organizations fighting deforestation and its global effect, you can gain insight on ways to help slow and eventually stop deforestation. For example:\n• WWF – For more than 50 years, the World Wildlife Federation has worked with government entities, companies, and communities promoting certification for responsible forest management practices, combating illegal logging, reforming trade policies, protecting forested land, and much more.\n• IUCN – Since 1948, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has been a membership Union composed of government and civil organizations. By providing public, private, and non-governmental organizations with information and tools that enable and support human progress, economic development, and nature conservation to take place simultaneously.\n• Pachamama Alliance – The Pachamama Alliance is a global community offering people the opportunity to learn, connect, engage, travel, and cherish life to create a sustainable future for all.

The extent of deforestation is so great that it is calculated that we have already lost half of the planet’s tropical rain forest and if we continue at the same rate we will have no forests left within a century.\nThis article explains what causes deforestation, what its effects are, and how we can all take action right now to prevent it from continuing.\nThe causes of deforestation.\nDeforestation is almost completely caused by human activity. Even taking into account natural disasters such as hurricanes or wild fires, humans are accountable for almost all deforestation on the planet, which amounts to a whopping 1.5 hectares of forest cut away per minute. Here are the main causes of deforestation.\n1. The timber industry: developed countries such as the US have a high demand for wooden furniture and other items made from timber. Though some species of trees are (in theory at least) protected from use in furniture making, others are being cut down in huge swathes to make mass produced, and often quickly discarded, items of furniture, house frames, boats, and other wooden items.\n2. The paper industry: again, developed countries are the ones fueling demand here. Paper is made from trees, and the more paper we use, the more deforestation we are responsible for.\n3. Animal agriculture: precious rain forests are cut away to make space for growing crops to feed to animals, and for making space for animal pens.\n4. Human habitats: humans cut into forests to build roads (as happened recently in an ancient forest in Russia) or to make way for building new homes or commercial centers.\n5. Palm oil production: often, rain forests are destroyed in order for palm oil to be cultivated. This ingredient is pretty much ubiquitous in cosmetics , fuels, many plastics, and even foodstuffs.\n7. Fuel: wood is used throughout the world as fuel, and in many regions of the world this has led to irresponsible deforestation rather than a careful and responsible use of only dead wood for fuel. In Sub Saharan Africa, for example, wood is burned as fuel at double the rate at which forests are growing, which spells very bad news for those forests.\nThe effects of deforestation.\nThe effects of deforestation are absolutely devastating, and it is vital to take action right now to stop deforestation from totally ruining our planet. Here are 5 of the key effects of deforestation on our precious world:\n1. Species loss: our rain forests are home to around half of the species in the world. When the rain forests are lost, these species will use their necessary habitats and so we will lose these species for ever as well.\n2. Climate change acceleration: around 280 gigatonnes of carbon is contained within the bark of the world’s trees. If burned, this would release a huge load of carbon into the atmosphere and result in a vast acceleration of global warming which would likely wipe out most of the humans and animals on this earth. Trees also have the capacity to suck carbon out of the atmosphere more generally: they are our allies against climate change.\n3. The loss of medicinal cures: many of the cures that we have for diseases such as cancer come from plants and trees growing in the Amazon rainforest. Once this rainforest is gone, human mortality rates from these diseases are likely to rise dramatically.\n4. Soil erosion: tree roots keep the soil beneath them in place. Cut down the trees and the roots die. As a result, the soil will be swept away by rain and wind. This results in desertification, or the process by which a once lush and fertile area of soil becomes a desert where nothing grows.\n5. Loss of the homes of indigenous peoples: many of the world’s indigenous populations live in rain forests such as the Amazon. The forest is their home, and it is not for other people to come and take it away from them. In addition around 1.6 billion people on this earth depend on forests for their livelihood in some shape or form, whether because they live in the forest or because they work closely with the forest in their day to day life.\nSolutions for deforestation.\nIt is imperative that we take action to halt and reverse deforestation right now. Here are a few solutions to deforestation that you can try right now.\n1. Avoid palm oil: check the ingredients of the food and cosmetics that you buy to ensure that it does not contain palm oil.\n2. Use less paper: avoid printing out documents wherever possible and try and use paper sparingly and wisely. Recycle or reuse old paper to make recycled notebooks, or use it as ‘rough paper’ for scribbling down odd ideas instead of buying a whole new note book. Buy second hand books rather than new books wherever possible. If you run or work in a business, encourage the whole business to do the same to make a bigger impact.\n3. Donate to reforestation projects: pump money in to the projects on the front line that are working to stop deforestation, and to actually reverse it by growing new forests. Many charities allow you to safeguard a section of forest by purchasing it for yourself.\n4. Use less wooden furniture: Where possible repair your old wooden items rather than throwing them out and replacing them with something new.\nPrev Post\nLong Speech on Independence Day in India\nCharacteristic Differences between Living and Non-living Things", "Effects of Deforestation on the Amazon - Amazon Aid Foundation\nEffects of Deforestation on the Amazon\nWhat happens to the Amazon when you cut down the trees? Not only does the Amazon affect our world’s\nclimate, but deforestation of the forests influence the region and its animals, plants and peoples.\nPhoto by Adrian Tejador\nDisruption of Livelihoods of Amazonia Peoples – Deforestation of forests directly affects and reduces the forest natural resources and ecosystem services. Cutting down rainforests can damage habitat, diminish levels of biodiversity and food sources, degrade the soil, pollute rivers and lands, and cause areas to dry out affecting the overall productivity for the peoples and animals that live there.\nLess Rain and Moisture and more fires – The trees in the Amazon make their own rainfall as weather patterns move from East to West. On a normal day the Amazon releases 20 billion tons of moisture into the atmosphere seeding the clouds with rain. Deforestation causes the forest to dry out and can cause drought and wildfires.\nReduction of Biodiversity – The destruction of forests destroys the homes, habitat and food sources for the species that live there. It is estimated that 100,000 species become extinct in tropical forests yearly. The loss of one species in an ecosystem can affect others who rely on it. The more biodiversity in a system the healthier and more resilient the system.\nHigher Temperatures – The Amazon is already extremely hot. Removing trees allows more sunlight to penetrate the forest floor, causing it to dry out and the ground surface to heat up. Also tree’s are made of carbon- a greenhouse gas. When trees are burned the carbon held in their trunks, roots, branches and leaves is released into the atmosphere, adding to the thermal layer that traps and absorbs heat on earth. Approximately 30% of all carbon emitted yearly is from the burning of trees. We are burning the very things that are protecting us.\nPollution – Increased human activities often bring degradation to the ecosystem, through destruction of trees which are a natural filter for pollutants, through improper use and treatment of water and soil, and\nDisruption of Migratory Corridors – Destruction of the forests can in many cases leave fragmented patches of habitat. These scattered portions of forest can cause issues for the animals who need connected contiguous forests to travel or migrate from one area to the next. Animals are unable to travel their normal paths for food which makes them vulnerable.\nErosion and degradation of the soil- The soil of the Amazon is thin and devoid of nutrients, with most of the nutrients found in the plants and animals. The trees of the Amazon not only keep the soil from eroding by holding the topsoil in place, but trees drop decaying matter that helps fertilize and feed the organisms that live in the soil. The forest canopy also shields the soil from the the intense heat which can dry out the soil, kill off the organisms, and release the carbon that is stored there. through the release of unregulated chemical and waste products. Unregulated small scale gold mining(ASGM)is one example of a human activity that pollutes the environment by releasing 30-100 tons of mercury into the Amazon yearly.\n01:19\n01:00", "Effects of Deforestation\nHealth and Safety\nEffects of Deforestation\nPosted on March 21, 2021 by Roshintha Perera\n21\nMar\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency defines deforestation as the “permanent removal of standing forests.” The removal, however, occurs for a variety of different reasons and has a variety of devastating consequences.\nWhat Is Deforestation?\nDeforestation is the clearing, destroying, or otherwise removal of trees through deliberate, natural, or accidental means. It can occur in any area densely populated by trees and other plant life, but the majority of it is currently happening in the Amazon rainforest.\nThe loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a host of problems for indigenous people.\nExplore how protecting forests is one of the top climate solutions with our free Reversing Global Warming online course.\nDeforestation occurs for a number of reasons, including farming, with 80% of deforestation resulting from extensive cattle ranching, and logging for materials and development. It has been happening for thousands of years, arguably since man began converting from hunter/gatherer to agricultural based societies, and required larger, unobstructed tracks of land to accommodate cattle, crops, and housing. It was only after the onset of the modern era that it became an epidemic.\nEnvironmental Effects of Deforestation From Above\nLoss of Habitat\nOne of the most dangerous and unsettling effects of deforestation is the loss of animal and plant species due to their loss of habitat. 70% of land animals and plant species live in forests. Not only does deforestation threaten species known to us, but also those unknown.\nThe trees of the rainforest that provide shelter for some species also provide the canopy that regulates the temperature. Deforestation results in a more drastic temperature variation from day to night, much like a desert, which could prove fatal for many inhabitants.\nIncreased Greenhouse Gases\nIn addition to the loss of habitat, the lack of trees also allows a greater amount of greenhouse gases to be released into the atmosphere. Healthy forests absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, acting as valuable carbon sinks. Deforested areas lose that ability and release more carbon.\nWater in the Atmosphere\nThe trees also help control the level of water in the atmosphere by helping to regulate the water cycle. In deforested areas, there is less water in the air to be returned to the soil. This then causes dryer soil and the inability to grow crops.\nEnvironmental Effects of Deforestation From Below\nSoil Erosion and Flooding\nFurther effects of deforestation include soil erosion and coastal flooding. Trees help the land to retain water and topsoil, which provides the rich nutrients to sustain additional forest life.\nWithout forests, the soil erodes and washes away, causing farmers to move on and perpetuate the cycle. The barren land which is left behind in the wake of these unsustainable agricultural practices is then more susceptible to flooding, specifically in coastal regions.\nEffects of Deforestation on Indigenous People\nDestruction of Homelands\nAs large amounts of forests are cleared away, allowing exposed earth to whither and die and the habitats of innumerable species to be destroyed, the indigenous communities who live there and depend on the forest to sustain their way of life are also under threat.\nThe loss of forests has an immediate and direct effect on their lifestyle that we in the highly industrialized parts of the world, despite our own dependency on what the rainforest provides, will never know. The level of immediacy is exponentially greater for indigenous peoples.\nThe governments of nations with rainforests in their borders often attempt to evict indigenous tribes before the actual clear-cutting begins. This is one of the pre-emptive effects of deforestation.\nSource – https://www.wwf.org.uk/learn/effects-of/deforestation"]}
{"query_id": "14", "generated_response": "Sports have profound and multifaceted impacts on society, touching everything from cultural identity to economic systems. Let me break down the key areas you've asked about:\n\n## Cultural Influence and Social Impact\n\nSports serve as powerful cultural forces that shape national and community identities [1]. They provide shared stories and common goals that unite diverse populations, with the United Nations declaring sport and play as human rights due to their ability to promote \"human values such as respect for the opponent, acceptance of binding rules, teamwork and fairness\" [3].\n\nSports have been catalysts for social change throughout history. Jackie Robinson's entry into Major League Baseball advanced civil rights, while athletes like Billie Jean King pioneered LGBTQ+ acceptance, and Colin Kaepernick's protests raised awareness about police brutality [2]. These examples demonstrate how sports can challenge societal norms and drive cultural progress.\n\n## Economic Impact and Business Evolution\n\nThe sports industry has become a massive economic force. In North America alone, the sports market grew from $60.5 billion in 2014 to a projected $73.5 billion by 2019 [2]. Globally, professional athletics generated $91 billion in revenue in 2017, with sports-related merchandise adding another $14.2 billion [7].\n\n**Media rights have emerged as the largest economic driver**, expected to reach $20.6 billion by 2019, surpassing traditional gate revenues [7]. This shift reflects how technology and broadcasting have transformed sports from local entertainment to global commercial enterprises.\n\n## Athlete Compensation and Professional Evolution\n\nThe commercialization of sports has dramatically changed athlete compensation. The 100 highest-paid athletes worldwide earned a collective $3.8 billion in recent years, representing a 23% increase [7]. This reflects the celebrity status athletes have achieved, where they become brands themselves.\n\nHowever, there's significant variation in earnings. While top athletes receive \"super-contracts and mega-salaries,\" many professional athletes still make limited incomes [5]. The sports industry has created new revenue streams including sponsorship ($18.3 billion projected by 2019) and merchandising opportunities [7].\n\n## Technology's Transformative Impact\n\nTechnology has revolutionized sports performance and fan experience:\n\n### Equipment Evolution\n- **Pole vaulting**: The switch from bamboo to fiberglass poles contributed to an 86% performance improvement over 94 years [8]\n- **Cycling**: Technological advances led to a 221% improvement in one-hour cycling records over 111 years [8]\n- **Swimming**: Full-body polyurethane suits made such significant impacts that 94% of swimming races at the 2008 Olympics were won by athletes wearing Speedo's LZR Racer suit before regulations were tightened [14]\n\n### Training and Performance Monitoring\nModern technology enables precise performance tracking through sensors, wearables, and data analytics [13][18]. Athletes now use computerized training systems to analyze technique, while sports medicine has advanced injury prevention and treatment [10].\n\n### Fan Engagement\nTechnology has transformed how fans experience sports through AR/VR applications, real-time statistics, social media integration, and mobile apps that provide immersive stadium experiences [23][24]. About 69% of sports fans worldwide report that emerging technologies have enhanced their viewing experience [22].\n\n## Inclusion and Diversity Challenges\n\nWhile sports promote unity, they also face significant inclusion challenges:\n\n- **Diversity gaps**: Sports settings are \"not free from bias and anti-inclusive practices,\" requiring cultural competence from professionals [6]\n- **Gender barriers**: Women face systemic challenges in sports leadership, with barriers including \"less access to social capital,\" \"institutional discrimination,\" and sports leadership being \"viewed as masculine\" [6]\n- **LGBTQ+ discrimination**: Sexual prejudice remains a serious issue, requiring policies that explicitly prohibit discrimination and educational training [6]\n\n## The Dual Nature of Sports Technology\n\nThe relationship between technology and athletic achievement creates ongoing debates about \"technological fairness.\" While innovations like Nike's Vaporfly running shoes have sparked controversy about unfair advantages, technology generally serves to:\n\n- Optimize human performance rather than replace it\n- Enhance safety through better protective equipment\n- Improve training methods and injury prevention\n- Create more engaging fan experiences\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nSports continue evolving as a reflection of societal values while simultaneously shaping them. The industry faces the challenge of balancing technological advancement with maintaining the \"integrity of the game,\" ensuring fair competition while embracing innovations that enhance performance and fan engagement [10][14].\n\nThe intersection of sports, technology, and society suggests that future developments will likely focus on personalized fan experiences, enhanced athlete performance monitoring, and continued efforts to make sports more inclusive and accessible to diverse populations.", "citations": ["https://sportandsociety.com/about/themes\n", "https://degree.astate.edu/articles/sport-administration/the-importance-of-sports-in-society.aspx\n", "https://nowcomment.com/documents/97820\n", "https://howtoadult.com/552524-sociocultural-influences-on-sports.html\n", "https://quizlet.com/81756323/sociology-of-sport-kine-2050-exam-3-ch-11-14-flash-cards/", "https://quizlet.com/389724604/sports-psychology-culture-and-inclusion-chapter-8-flash-cards/", "https://online.stu.edu/articles/business/the-economics-of-sports.aspx", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26821546_The_Impact_of_Technology_on_Sporting_Performance_in_Olympic_Sports\n", "https://dailyhodl.com/2021/10/20/the-relationship-between-sports-and-tech-how-did-it-evolve-over-the-years/\n", "http://www.scienceclarified.com/dispute/Vol-1/Have-technological-advances-in-sports-such-as-tennis-golf-and-track-and-field-supplanted-the-athletic-achievements-of-the-participants-in-those-sports.html", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337611793_Impact_of_technology_on_the_evolution_of_sports_training", "https://www.shareyouressays.com/essays/essay-on-sports-equipment-an-emerging-technology/84524", "https://www.rolling-tales.com/technology-in-enhancing-sports-training/", "https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat3399", "https://ca.news.yahoo.com/technologys-positive-impact-sports-105837468.html", "http://www.leoisaac.com/sportman/sportman06.htm\n", "https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/04/23/athletic-performance-has-been-improving-steadily-for-decades", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27918664/", "https://sportsbroadcasting.weebly.com/technology-in-sports.html", "https://www.statista.com/study/88816/impact-of-technology-on-professional-sport-and-the-fan-experience/", "https://www.statsperform.com/resource/the-sports-tech-trends-shaping-sports-media-fan-engagement-in-2021/\n", "https://www.statista.com/statistics/1100581/new-technology-sports-experience/", "https://medium.com/swlh/how-technology-is-changing-the-sports-fan-experience-6f32a5bf921d", "https://www.statista.com/statistics/1100540/sports-stadium-experience-technology/"], "contexts": ["Themes | Sport & Society Research Network\nTheme 1: Sporting Cultures and Identities\nOn sport’s motivations, meanings and purposes.

Sports are a telling reflection of a society's values, and they are a significant contributor as well, especially in the United States. Sports impact our culture, our other sources of entertainment and our economy.\nCulture\nSports have always had a monumental impact on culture and values in the United States. Jackie Robinson's entry into Major League Baseball was a catalyst for long-overdue improvements in civil rights for African Americans. Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova were more than just tennis greats; they were pioneers in the acceptance of the LGBT community in America. Muhammad Ali may or may not have been the greatest boxer of all time, but he was certainly one of the most storied legends in sports, and an icon for standing up for one's deeply held convictions, despite the consequences.\nToday, the sports world finds itself in the spotlight of cultural attitude shifts. The #MeToo movement and sexual offenses against women in the sports world, including the Larry Nasser scandal, helped to bring light to a problem that had been underexposed and had been allowed to exist for too long. Similarly, the recent Colin Kaepernick controversy, in which he led a movement of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem, raised awareness of police brutality against African Americans, and led to the NFL agreeing to devote substantial funds to help reverse the trend in cities across America.\nEconomy\nThe sports market in North America has increased in size from $60.5 billion in 2014 to a projected total of $73.5 billion in 2019, according to Forbes. Media rights deals are expected to surpass gate revenues as the largest economic driver, rising from $14.6 billion in 2014 to $20.6 billion by 2019. It is no wonder that we have seen star athletes across the major sports, both team and individual, earning exponentially more than their predecessors from just two or three decades ago. The categories of sponsorship and licensed merchandise have continued to skyrocket in revenue generation as well, driven by the popularity of items like NFL jerseys, endorsed sporting equipment and video games. This revenue is expected to rise to $18.3 billion in 2019, up from $14.7 billion in 2014.\nThe sports betting industry is a slice of the overall sports industry, and it alone is estimated to have an international market capitalization of $250 billion. Wherever there is economic prosperity, this industry also thrives, including in countries in the Far East, Africa, Latin America, Europe and the U.S.\nFootball predominates in the betting world (the European kind is #1 and the American kind is #2, globally). Licensed online sportsbooks account for approximately $39.7 billion of this revenue and the rest is split among venues including casinos and horse tracks. The United States is one of the largest and fastest growing sports betting markets, with a present market capitalization of $60-73 billion.\nMeasuring the revenue generation of specific sports industry segments alone does little to capture the overall economic value of sports teams to the geographic regions they play in and represent. Think of all of the ancillary industries built around sports stadiums, from restaurants and hotels to ballpark and street vendors. In any given city, many of these businesses would quickly fail if the team left.\nLebron James is the most valuable free agent in the history of sports, and a great example of this concept. When he moved from Miami to Cleveland in 2010, the Miami Heat's franchise value dropped from $476 million to $355 million in a single year. During that same time, downtown Cleveland came alive, with companies relocating to Cleveland and the downtown area, internationally known chefs opening restaurants, and conference venues that were unpopular destinations becoming overnight successes.\nEntertainment\nMovies about sports have generated millions of dollars at the box office and become cultural phenomena in their own right. The Blind Side, about an adopted child who went on to become an NFL player, generated $256 million, and Adam Sandler's flick, The Waterboy grossed $161.5 million. Talladega Nights, a comedic take on NASCAR, generated $148.2 million, and the list goes on.\nThe cultural impact of sports movies is arguably even greater than the economic impact. What American who has visited the City of Brotherly Love has not taken the chance to run up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art to personally experience the triumph of Rocky. And who does not know the references from Karate Kid of \"wax on, wax off\"? Name a sport you love, and there is an iconic movie that has elevated its cultural influence — from Bull Durham (baseball) and Caddyshack (golf) to The Mighty Ducks (hockey) and Warrior (UFC).\nIndeed, sports are far more than just a game. The professionals running sports organizations and programs behind the scenes are key contributors to the importance of sports in society. You could soon find yourself in the middle of the action as a graduate of Arkansas State University's online Master of Science program in Sport Administration.\nLearn more about A-State's Master of Science in Sport Administration online program.\nSources:\nStreet & Smiths Sports Business Journal: Measuring What Counts: The Impact of Sport on Society\nBleacher Report: The 10 Absolute Craziest Sports on the Planet\nSBD: The Size and Increase of the Global Sports Betting Market\nDeloitte: 2019 Sports Industry Game-Changers\nForbes: Sports Industry to Reach $73.5 Billion by 2019\nESPN: Lebron James is Worth Hundreds of Millions to the Cavs and Cleveland\nSBJ: Sports Movies With the Biggest Box Office Since 1998\nDid you enjoy this article?\nSubscribe to our newsletter by entering your email to receive more like it.\nHave a question or concern about this article?

Today, contests pushing physical limits are more popular than ever before. As interest in health and longevity continues to rise, and governments and businesses continue to see sporting events as sound investments, sports will play a vital role in society for the foreseeable future.\n2Sports As a Way of Life\n4 3At no other time in history have sports played such a dominant role in daily life. Thanks to the prevalence of the internet and television, adults and children alike consume sports at an astonishing rate. When we are not physically involved in sports, we play them via video games or in fantasy leagues, and we watch them on TV. The celebrity status of top athletes speaks to the importance we attach to sporting events.\n4Athletic endeavors, both amateur and professional, have a tremendous economic, political and cultural influence on our society. Watching and playing sports provide ways to escape the stress of our daily lives and come together as a community. Hosting sporting events can boost tourism and revenue for a city. Sports in society can even influence our understanding of gender roles and socio-economic issues, and they can help frame city-, state- and national identity.\n5Sports’ immense effect on culture is especially evident among those who may not enjoy playing or watching sports–these people often still know the names of key players, and they may still take national pride in Olympic medals. No matter your individual involvement, sports generally provide everyone in a society with some form of a shared story and a shared goal.\n6In fact, sports in society are so vital that the United Nations (UN) has declared them a human right: “Sport and play are human rights that must be respected and enforced worldwide; sport has been increasingly recognized and used as a low-cost and high-impact tool in humanitarian, development and peace-building efforts.”\n7While the UN recognizes that sports can also, at times, negatively influence society with corruption, scandal and the incitement of violence, their positive influence far outweighs their negative aspects: “Sport has a unique power to attract, mobilize and inspire. By its very nature, sport is about participation. It is about inclusion and citizenship. It stands for human values such as respect for the opponent, acceptance of binding rules, teamwork and fairness, all of which are principles which are also contained in the Charter of the United Nations.”\n8Physical activities like sports, whether for recreational, professional or educational purposes, are not merely about fitness or victory; above all, they are an essential building block of a prosperous and healthy society. Much like a country’s educational system, media or political and social movements, sporting events bring disparate people together by strengthening ties and celebrating the common ideals of fairness, sacrifice and hope. Sports in society remind us that following prescribed rules does not have to be boring and that we must always carve out a place for fun in our lives.\n9A Career in Sports\n10The importance of sports in society extends to those who make a career in sports in other ways than playing on a professional team. To follow this path, many professionals earn a master’s degree in sports management . The program is ideal for individuals who enjoy exploring the cultural, economic or sociological sides of sports. For example, in its online Master of Science in kinesiology with a specialization in sport management degree program, Louisiana State University offers a course titled “Social Issues in Sports,” which provides an in-depth examination of the role of sports in society and highlights key issues in professional sports.\n11A master’s degree in sports management could be a good choice for those who enjoy exercising their minds as much as their bodies.\n12Learn about the LSU online MS in Kinesiology with a Specialization in Sport Management program.\n13Sources:\n14USADA: What Sport Means in America: A Study of Sport’s Role in Society\n15United Nations: Office on Sport for Development and Peace: Overview\n16Sport and Society\n17Psychology Today: Why Are Sports Important?\n16 General Document comments\n61 Sentence and Paragraph comments\n0 Image and Video comments\nParagraph 1\nSep  3\nCesar E\nSep 24\nSep  3\n:.\ndoing sports can help you with a lot of things, like Better Sleep, Strong Heart, Reduces Stress,\nReply\nSep 17\nBetzaida A:sports\nSports provide entertainment for both the players and viewers.Sports allow both players and viewers to feel strong emotions towards sports.\nReply\nSep 17\nJuan S:entertainment\nentertainment\nReply\nSep 23\nLluvia Natalya B:in fact sports in society are so vital that the united nations (un) has declared them a human rights\nReply\nSep 23\nLluvia Natalya B:At no other time in history have sports played such a dominant role in daily life\nReply\nSep 24\nSaid C:Sports\nsports contains emotions when losing or winning. but you learn from either of those two. you get better in your own way if you decide to work for those goals\nReply\nSep 24\nDestiny C:sports is entertainment for people and you can meet other people from all around the world and can bring people together.\nReply\nSep 24\nErick Andres C:acer deporte puede ayudarte con muchas cosas, como dormir mejor, tener un corazón fuerte, reducir el estrés,\nReply\nSep 24\nOrlando G:Role of sports\nSports use to be something for fun a long time ago now it is used as a career people make millons from playing sports and other people enjoy watching them it gives people something to look forward to.

The sports that are valued by specific cultures depend on many variables. Society and culture are powerful influences on how valuable sports are perceived to be, what sports are the most important within a community and what teams the general population cheers for. Society also influences the changes in popularity across different sports and players.\nCompetition\nMany societies value competition as part of their culture. Competition is used to encourage people to constantly improve their skills so they are able to achieve what they want out of life. Sports play into this because most are highly competitive and are only available to a select few. During childhood, the good players are often identified quickly and are able to make the team consistently. Competition drives these players to continue improving their skills, particularly if they wish to join the elite few that make up professional sports teams. Competition also comes into play for fans who root for and against certain teams playing for coveted championship titles. Certain societies encourage rivalries between fans and teams as part of their cultural norms.\nHeroes\nSports players are often revered, in certain societies, as having hero status. The sheer amount of money paid to many professional sports players supports the notion of importance these individuals play in society. The \"International Review for the Sociology of Sport\" notes that sports players can have enormous influence on the values of individual cultures 2 ⭐ 3 ⭐ 4 ⭐. Sports players also become a product of certain cultures based on what they value as talent. In cultures that value sports and competition, sports players are often hailed as being some of the best of what each society has to offer.\nValues\nThe influence of individuals within a society plays a role in the importance of sports. When young children are exposed to sports by their parents, either by playing or through fan behavior, they are more likely to enjoy sports as well. The journal \"Perspectives in Public Health\" reports that peers also have a powerful influence on the acceptance and value of sports during childhood 5 ⭐. When a society values physical activity, more sports opportunities are available, which might also influence how likely individuals are to value sports. In communities with professional sports teams, sports might become even more valuable and influential.\nCustoms\nSocietal customs play another key role in the acceptance and value of sports. When sports become part of everyday culture, they become more important within a certain society. Baseball is considered \"America's pastime,\" and has become an identifying factor within American culture. Similarly, football, called soccer in the United States, plays an important role in the customs of England, Spain and Mexico. Many cultures center social activity on participation in sports, so weekends might be spent playing or watching sports with friends or family.\nReferences\nInternational Review for the Sociology of Sport: Sport Star vs. Rock Star in Globalizing Popular Culture\nAbout the Author\nSara Ipatenco has taught writing, health and nutrition.

Globally, professional athletics accounted for $91 billion in revenue, and sports-related merchandise generated $14.2 billion in sales in 2017, according to the online statistics resource Statista. That number is significantly higher than the $46.5 billion generated by professional sports in 2005. The majority of that economic activity is from the U.S. sports industry, according to Forbes. The 2015 article predicts that the U.S. sports market will reach $73.5 billion by 2019, largely from media rights.\n\"Sports media rights are projected to go from $14.6 billion in 2014 to $20.6 billion by 2019, accounting for a compound annual rate increase of 7.2 percent,\" the article said. \"Over 35% of current local television rights deals with the National Basketball Association, National Hockey League and Major League Baseball are set to expire by 2019, which will contribute to the overall growth in the sector based on assumed lucrative new deals, but national rights deals truly drive the growth in this area.\"\nAmericans tune in to sports games by the millions. The most viewed sporting event of 2017 was Super Bowl 51, which had over 111 million viewers. Football continues to be the most popular U.S. sport, with 37 percent of adults listing it as their favorite, according to Gallup, followed by basketball (11 percent) and baseball (9 percent).\nThe World and U.S. Sports Sector in Numbers\nForbes offers a breakdown of revenue within the sports industry: In 2019, media rights are predicted to be the largest portion of earnings at $20.6 billion, followed by gate revenues ($20.1 billion), sponsorship ($18.3 billion) and merchandising ($14.5 billion).\nNot surprisingly, athletes account for a large portion of any professional sports team's budget. According to a recent Forbes article, the 100 highest-paid athletes across the world earned a collective $3.8 billion over the past 12 months.\n\"That is up 23 percent from last year,\" the article said. \"Credit the huge paydays for the Mayweather-McGregor [boxing] bout and exploding salaries in the NBA. The cutoff rose $1.5 million, with Charlotte Hornets wing player Nicolas Batum ranked No. 100 at $22.9 million.\"\nWithin the United States, the article said, players in the NBA account for the largest portion of top earners, followed by the NFL, MLB, MLS, PGA, boxing and tennis.\nCoaches are also high earners within professional sports. Last year, University of Alabama head coach Nick Saban became the highest-paid coach in the United States with a 2017 salary of just over $11 million. His current contract, signed in 2014 and good through 2025, totals $65 million.\nBusiness Trends Within the Sporting World\nStadiums and televisions continue to compete for spectators' attention, according to the 2015 Forbes article. Citing data from the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the article said that media rights will surpass gate revenues in the \"near future.\" Stadiums are taking measures to boost attendance, which include new seating styles, upgraded suites and enhanced concessions.\nMerchandise may see a boost in returns, the article noted, due to a predicted expansion in the female retail market. PwC, according to the article, anticipates that \"licensed merchandise sales will go from an estimated $13.5 billion in 2014 to $14.5 billion in 2019.\"\nSponsorship revenue will continue to see steady growth, the article said, from \"approximately $14.7 billion in 2014 to $15.3 billion in 2015 and $18.3 billion by 2019.\"\nNew facilities offer opportunities for naming rights, the article added. Outside of professional sports, the kids' sports industry reached $15.3 billion last year, according to a 2017 article in Time. The market for youth sports has doubled in value over the last decade, with the rising cost suggesting less participation from low-income families.\nBe a Business Leader in the World of Professional Sports\nAs the U.S. sports market approaches the $100 billion mark, there are growing opportunities for sports administrators to launch or advance their careers within the industry.

The concept of a performance improvement index was developed to allow comparison between athletes and between sports with a higher index indicating a greater improvement in the sport. The following performance improvement indices were found: 100-m sprint, 24% over 108 years; pole vault, 86% over 94 years; javelin, 95% over 76 years; 4-km individual pursuit, 35% over 32 years; one-hour cycling record, 221% over 111 years. Around 4% of the index for the sprint was attributed to tighter, aerodynamic clothing, suggesting that general athletic improvement in sprint-type events has been around 20%. Technological developments in simple equipment such as the pole vault or javelin were seen to affect the index by around 30%, while the index associated with aerodynamic improvements in the one-hour record was around 100%. It is concluded that the performance improvement index could be extended to amateur as well as elite sport where distance or time is used as a measure of performance.\nNo full-text available\n... In sports such as rugby and football, a player's foot creates high horizontal shear forces (torsional and linear) between the boot and the surface. In the modern professional era, significant investment is made in sports to enable athletes to perform to their full potential: This is evident from developments in athlete nutrition, training and technology (Haake, 2009 ). These developments have made athletes body shapes optimal to their sport, subsequently increasing forces and further placing strain on the natural sports surfaces.  ...\n... Prior to the 1980s, turfgrass was predominantly clay-based (Young and Henderson, 2016), which had a tendency in cold wet winter months to becoming muddied, losing grass coverage and deforming to create divots (James, 2011(James, , 2015Serensits, McNitt and Petrunak, 2011). These characteristics used to be accepted as 'part of the game' but as technologies in apparel and player performance have improved (Haake, 2009), combined with the high stakes of modern professional sport and the scrutiny of media, the sports turf has become a key component in performance.  ...\n... Many sports have progressed with modern technologies (Haake, 2009). Focusing on Football and Rugby Union, this was seen by the advancement in technologies in player's apparel, the equipment used in the sport and the technologies to adjudicate the current versions of the games.  ...\nDevelopment of a Turf Stability Assessment Method for Sports Surfaces\nThesis\nFull-text available\nNov 2018\nFrazer Anderson\nView\nShow abstract\n...

The main driving force in this progress was regularly improved training routines, but the significant effect on the progress in the swimming performance, especially in 2008-2009, was observed following the introduction of special swimsuits that reduced body resistance in the water environment and increased swimmer body buoyancy in water. This led to 43 world records set in the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome in 2009 [3, 4,5]. FINA's ban on these swimsuits came into effect in 2010.  ...\n... However, a noticeable rise in the level of swimming results was observed in both men's and women's events in the second half of the first decade of the 21st century. This increase in the level of sports performance in swimming was caused by the introduction of special swimsuits that helped athletes achieve record-braking results [3, 4,5].

Performance improvements in solo time-trial events have been attributed to advances in bike technology and aerodynamic positioning [31], but in races where competitors are able to draft, the benefits of technology are much more difficult to quantify. Lippi and colleagues [54] analysed the average speed of Tour de France winners across the decades and attributed some of the improvement to major advances in bike technology from 1926 to 1970, as well as improvements in training, nutrition, and an increasing prevalence of doping across this period (see 'Subversive Behaviours: the Prevalence of Doping' section).  ...\n... The stabilisation of average speeds of Tour de France winners in recent decades is thought to be a result of reaching a ceiling in improvements in training and bike technology, as well as improvements in anti-doping measures. Notably, the improvements in cycling performance attributed (in part) to advances in bike technology by Haake [31] and Lippe et al. [54] occurred over several decades, whereas most athletes competing against each other in any particular race or competition are likely to have access to technological developments at roughly the same time. As such, differences in bike technology in races with multiple opponents are unlikely to be of a magnitude that differentiates between cyclists' chances of success within a particular race.  ...\nDeterminants of Cycling Performance: a Review of the Dimensions and Features Regulating Performance in Elite Cycling Competitions\nArticle\nFull-text available\nJun 2020\nKathryn E.

This change includes several improvements in different aspects of every discipline, starting with apparel and clothing, to measuring systems and monetizing sports.\nLet’s explore the relationship between sports and tech more closely – the ways it has evolved over the years, and see where we’re at now.\nEquipment and apparel\nBack in the day, training was limited to what athletes could do naturally with their bodies and a limited set of machinery. With wearables, one can monitor the physical state of the athlete, such as heart rate, hydration levels and more.\nThis helps coaches see the effects that the training has on the athlete and optimize their training accordingly. At the same time, modern gym equipment allows building strength in certain parts of the athlete’s body by isolating some muscle groups without overtraining others.\nSports clothing has also changed greatly to better suit the athletes’ needs. Half a century ago, clothing was meant to keep the athlete comfortable while exercising. Now, wearables and clothes play a much larger role in improving overall performance.\nFor one, lighter and more comfortable shoes are now available and adapted for different disciplines and surfaces. High-tech fabrics wick the sweat away from the body instead of absorbing it, while membranes help keep the athlete warm and dry when training outdoors.\nBroadcasting and fan engagement before and after Covid\nThe development of the web changed the way athletes interact with their following, giving birth to fan engagement platforms and content hubs all over the internet. With the help of these platforms, athletes and team managers can gauge the reaction of their communities about a certain change in a team quickly. Social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, facilitated this interaction, connecting athletes, team directives and fans.\nIn 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic became a black swan for the sports industry, pushing it for innovation. Due to the heavy losses that the sports sector experienced last year, teams and players were forced to consider alternative revenue sources, like esports simulators and betting.\nToday, as the sports industry is recovering, and there is still a period of limited attendance to venues, teams can offer immersive services that could allow fans to attend events virtually and still get a great experience.\nSports – decentralized\nAnother trend triggered by both the pandemic and a call for a more immersive fan experience is the introduction of blockchain, NFTs and fan tokens into sports. Through these technologies, athletes and teams get access to new revenues, while fans can play a profound role in their hero’s life.\nNFTs can be harnessed in different ways – first, generative NFTs can be based on the players of a team or on athletes of any sport to act like collectibles with unique capabilities for fans. Second, they can also portray special moments in the life of an athlete or a team, and serve as collectibles for fans to remember those moments. And third, we are witnessing a rise in play-to-earn models, where digital assets can be used as virtual currencies in virtual worlds, giving fans access to unique rewards.\nFan tokens – a kind of inner currency issued by a team, federation or platform – are another novel way to create new revenue sources, provide more engagement for fans and bring fans and teams closer in the post-pandemic world. These tokens give fans direct access to special promotions – including meet and greets with their favorite athletes – and help the team to make decisions via token holders’ votes.\nWhat does the future hold?\nThere is no doubt that technology will keep powering all aspects of sports. Still, decentralized technology, mainly due to the great potential for fan engagement and monetization, is likely to play a key role in the development of the sports industry in the next decade.\nPaired with other new technologies created to entice the users to consume products and services coming from their favorite teams, it could become one of the main alternative revenue paths for sports teams and players in the near future.\nRyan Wilkinson, head of product at Blockasset.co\nCheck Latest Headlines on HodlX\nFollow Us on Twitter Facebook Telegram\nCheck out the Latest Industry Announcements\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Today advertisements for new types of\n      running shoes, golf clubs, tennis rackets, and hundreds of other sports\n      accessories bombard us. The level of scientific research into something as\n      simple as a golf ball can be mind-boggling. With new materials and\n      computer engineering, improvements are being made on sporting equipment\n      faster than marketers can publicize them.\nThis advance in technology has broadened the spectrum of athletes.\n      Improvements in safety standards, cost, and accessibility have allowed\n      more people to take advantage of formerly exclusive sporting events.\n      Self-improvement and exercise are thriving businesses, and sporting\n      manufacturers have capitalized on this interest, promising better\n      performance as the result of their equipment or product.\nSports technology has found its greatest proponents among professional\n      athletes. Athletes like Pete Sampras, Tiger Woods, and Nick Hysong now\n      have access to far better equipment than ever before. Advances in sports\n      equipment have undoubtedly played a role in the achievement of these\n      athletes in their respective fields.\nAthletes are often elevated to the status of superheroes, revered by the\n      public for their successes. Many consider the players even more important\n      than the game. This, in turn, has made competition fiercer than ever. With\n      enormous amounts of money, and sponsorship, riding on an athlete's\n      performance, the old adage \"it isn't whether you win or\n      lose\" has fallen to the wayside. Some would argue that\n      today's athletes are willing to take any advantage they can get.\n      They want to hit further, jump higher, or run faster and further than\n      their opponent. Could it be argued that winning for the sake of winning\n      has begun to replace the wonder of athletic achievement? If so, how large\n      a role does technology play in that success? What truly makes these\n      athletes exceptional? Is it personal achievement in and dedication to\n      their sport, or has technology made them into the athletes they are today?\n      Did Venus Williams or her racket win Wimbledon in 2001? Did David Duval\n      become the 2001 U.S. Open golf champion because of practice or because he\n      used a certain type of club? Was it the shoes Marion Jones wore or her\n      tireless training that captured the 2000 Olympic gold medals in the\n      Women's 100M and 200M races?\nWhile some would argue that there is no replacement for raw athletic\n      talent, many maintain that the technological advances in sporting\n      equipment have added significantly to athletic performance. For example,\n      there is disagreement about whether current-day athletic achievements\n      should be viewed with the same regard as records established in the\n      past—when athletes were performing without the benefit of graphite\n      tennis rackets, fiberglass poles, ultra-light running shoes, and titanium\n      golf clubs. Even the athletes themselves are divided on the issue. Despite\n      the ongoing debate, it is certain that athletes will continue to utilize\n      advances in sports technology to enhance and better their performance.\n—LEE ANN PARADISE\nViewpoint: Yes, advanced technology in sports has significantly narrowed\n        the gap between world record holders and the way the athletic\n        achievement is perceived.\nWhen people talk about the prowess of Tiger Woods, Michael Chang, or\n        Stacy Dragila, the 2000 Olympic gold medalist in the women's pole\n        vault, it's impossible to ignore how improvements in sports\n        equipment contributed to their success. While technological advances do\n        not negate the achievement of the athletes or fully explain their\n        accomplishments, better golf balls, tennis rackets with bigger\n        \"sweet spots,\" and springier poles have enabled athletes\n        to perform better in this century than ever before. No competitive\n        professional would think of returning to the wooden tennis racquet or\n        smooth golf ball. Today, the alternatives are just that much better.\nTechnological Improvements of Sports Equipment\nIn 1963 with the advent of aluminum, fiberglass, and graphite poles, the\n        pole vault record shot up 2 ft (0.61 m) in three years and now stands at\n        over 20 ft (6.09 m). Prior to that technological innovation, the pole\n        vault record increased only about 2 in (5 cm) to 16 ft (4.88 m) between\n        1942 and 1960. At the Atlanta Olympics, Michael Johnson became the first\n        male athlete to win both the 200-and 400-meter sprint. He also set the\n        new world record in the 200-meter sprint—wearing specially\n        designed ultra-light Nike running shoes weighing just 3.4 oz (96.39 g).\n        Now, many sprinters also wear full-body suits to reduce wind resistance,\n        which could make the critical hundreth of a second difference in a race.\nIn the future, the advanced technology of the vaulting pole, running\n        shoes, or golf ball will make more of a difference in the future than it\n        has in the past. In some sports it will be because the time differences\n        between first and second place will continue to shrink, allowing more\n        room for technological improvements in equipment to give athletes an\n        edge. Also, sports technology is not just limited to improvements in\n        equipment. The modern-day athlete can now depend on computerized\n        training systems to analyze their swing, stride, and follow-through.\nWhen discussing technological improvements to sports equipment a\n        distinction must be drawn between legitimate improvements and\n        improvements that give athletes an unfair advantage—the equipment\n        equivalent of performance enhancing drugs. In almost every sport\n        there's been debate about how this distinction should be drawn.\n        After a German inventor devised a \"spaghetti racquet\" with\n        a standard frame and double strings fitted with plastic tubes designed\n        to give the ball more topspin, the International Tennis Federation\n        jumped in to prevent potential uproar. A tennis racquet could be made\n        out of any material, be any weight, size, and shape, the Federation\n        said, but it cannot alter the flight of the ball and the strings must\n        also be evenly spaced.\nSometimes the distinction is not so clear. A new golf club, the ERC II,\n        does not conform to United States Golf Association specifications\n        because of a \"trampoline effect\" that gives the club more\n        spring. However, the USGA does allow some spring in golf clubs—as\n        long as it's below a set \"spring-back number\" of\n        83%. Similarly, with the introduction of fiberglass poles for use in the\n        pole vault there are now over 200 poles of varying stiffnesses from\n        different makers. In 1998, a special United States Track and Field Pole\n        Vault Equipment Task Force was created to determine if there should be a\n        standard \"flex number\" for maufacturers to follow.\nSports Technology—Optimizing Athletic Performance\nThe recent push of athletic associations to standardize rather than\n        outlaw new innovations points to the growing importance of sports\n        technology for optimizing athletic performance. Although some current\n        changes are more apparent than others—like form-fitting body\n        suits that some world-class swimmers and sprinters now wear—there\n        has been a steady evolution of even seemingly mundane sports equipment\n        for decades.\nOne of the best examples is the golf ball. The first generation of golf\n        balls resembled hacky sacks, covered and leather and filled with \n         feathers. The ball, called a \"feathery,\" could be struck\n        up to 200 yd (182.88 m) but slowed when it became damp. Around the same\n        time, ballmakers started experimenting with the gutty ball, a golf ball\n        made out of a rubbery substance called \"gutta-percha\" from\n        India. When softened in hot water, gutta-percha could be rolled into the\n        shape of a ball with the hands.\nSoon after, ballmakers made a sports-changing discovery: The newly made\n        smooth balls did not fly as well as older balls. The reason? As golfers\n        hit the balls, the surface of the balls became more nicked, and the\n        bumpy surface is what made the difference in performance. The bumps or\n        dimples on a golf ball trap a layer of air that extends the flight of\n        the ball. Since the golf balls travel forward with a backspin, the layer\n        of air on top of the ball moves faster than the layer of air at the\n        bottom. This creates more air pressure underneath the ball, resulting in\n        better lift. Years later, the dimpled golf ball still survived but in a\n        different form. The new golf ball consisted of rubber strips wound\n        around a rubber core—signaling the death knell of the gutty ball.\nIn the past century, carbon fiberglass—lighter than metal or\n        wood—revolutionized both tennis and the pole vault. When pole\n        vaulting began as a competitive sport, athletes used bamboo poles with a\n        sharp point at the bottom to plant in the grass. Today, modern poles are\n        made out of fiberglass and are much lighter than their bamboo or metal\n        counterparts. The lighter poles allow athletes to run faster and gain\n        the momentum they need to vault higher.\nThe new poles also have more spring. The fiberglass pole absorbs more of\n        the vaulter's energy when it bends and as it straightens. Along\n        with rubberized track surfaces, special boxes for planting the pole, and\n        padded landing pits, the new fiberglass poles help athletes attain\n        records that would be impossible to obtain using the traditional\n        equipment.\nToday, tennis rackets that used to be made out of wood have also turned\n        composite. This in spite of former Wimbledon champion Bjorn\n        Borg's stubborn insistence on using his wooden racket even after\n        the introduction of the new lighter metal and graphite rackets. In the\n        1960s, manufacturers started introducing metal frames of steel and\n        aluminum, later turning to an array of materials from titanium to\n        graphite shells with plastic foam cores. Modern-day tennis rackets also\n        feature larger \"sweet spots\" that minimize vibration.\nAside from using new materials, manufacturers also started experimenting\n        with the physical design of the tennis racket. When Head increased the\n        size of the face of its racket 20%, it resulted in a 300% increase in\n        the size of the sweet spot. Later, Prince introduced its Long-Body\n        tennis racket designed to have a greater length and give the player more\n        control. New lighter materials like graphite helped maufacturers to\n        lengthen rackets, giving shorter players like Michael Chang a longer\n        reach without a lot of additional weight.\nAs for golf, the traditional wooden golf club has changed as much as the\n        ball. Golfers now use drivers with the weight distributed around the\n        edge of the clubhead, specially designed to maximize the efficiency of\n        each hit. The titanium-based shafts and club heads have also helped\n        professionals and weekend golfers improve their game.\nIt's difficult to assess precisely how much of a difference\n        improved technology makes in the competitiveness of an athlete. But\n        it's undeniable that the equipment—whether it's the\n        shoes, ball, or pole—is receiving more attention than in the\n        past. The evolution of the pole vault is a prime example. In their\n        coverage of the 2000 Olympics, Newsday.com ran an infographic about the switch from fiberglass to metal poles.\n        Another Web site, NBCOlympics.com , hosted a chat with Stacy Dragila, the American gold medalist of the\n        first ever women's Olympic pole vault. Participants asked her\n        about her training regime, mindset, injuries, and the improvements seen\n        in pole technology. To the questioner who asked, \"How much of the\n        sport depends on the pole? How much depends on the athlete?\"\n        Dragila gave this telling response: \"That's a tough\n        question. I think it's a 50/50 take right there. You have to be\n        able to maximize your pole selection as well as your athleticism. If\n        you're not comfortable with your pole, I think it's very\n        hard for the vaulter to maximize her strength on the pole, so\n        it's a 50/50 toss.\"\nOn the golf course, as the technological revolution of the golf ball\n        continues, it appears that the wound ball with its core of tightly\n        wrapped rubber bands will now go the way of the feathery and the gutty\n        ball. In the 2000 \n         Masters, 59 out of 95 players hit wound balls. A year later, only four\n        competitors chose to use wound balls. The solid-core ball is quickly\n        becoming the ball of choice. When Tiger Woods used wound balls, he\n        averaged a 288.9 yd (264.17 m) drive. With the solid-core, he averages\n        305.4 yd (279.26 m). But the innovation doesn't stop at the golf\n        ball core. When Jesper Parnevik won the Honda Classic, he cited the new\n        Titleist Pro VI as contributing factor in his win. The new ball\n        featuring an innovative dimple design and \"ionamer casing\"\n        results in higher ball speed with lower spin.\nIn addition to revolutionizing equipment, improved sports technology has\n        also shrunk the difference between winners and losers, allowing\n        thousandths of a second to decide who finishes first and who finishes\n        second. Modern-day timing systems start with the firing of the starting\n        gun and stop when a light-based sensor detects the winner across the\n        finish line. Now that there are fewer improvements that can be made to\n        the equipment—namely limited to slight adjustments to the surface\n        of the track and weight of the shoes—the difference in winning\n        times of the 100-meter sprint has shrunk. Improvements are now made in\n        about 0.006 second increments rather than the 0.015 second improvements\n        seen in the early 1900s. Although improvements in time, at least in the\n        shorter running events, will be largely due to the training regime of\n        the athletes, the technology that measures their performance will be\n        distinguishing a \"win\" that might have been a\n        \"tie\" a century ago.\nComputerized measuring devices might even change the judging of other\n        sports like the pole vault. Historically, the pole vault has been judged\n        strictly on the height of the bar that the athlete scaled. Now, poles\n        with light-emitting diode (LEDs) can measure the actual altitude a pole\n        vaulter has achieved.\nAside from altering the way we conceive of winning and losing, in sports\n        like tennis and golf, computer-based systems are now helping players\n        analyze their performance over weeks, months, or even during the course\n        of a season. Since 1997, both PGA and LPGA Tour players have used a\n        tracking system called SportsTrac to monitor their performance.\n        Similarly, IBM computers at Wimbledon receive an input of shots played\n        and points won, the umpires record information about the match in\n        personal digital assistants, and a radar measures the speed of\n        players' serves. At the end of a match, players and coaches\n        receive a 40-page report of the collected data.\nAs the equipment and training regimes of athletes become more\n        sophisticated, technological innovation will play a larger role in\n        dictating winners and losers. Races that would have been ties when\n        measured with older technology will now be definitively decided. Access\n        to the latest golf balls that fly farther than their predecessors will\n        not replace hours-long practice sessions, but the technology has become\n        so advanced that it could make the one or two stroke difference at the\n        end of the tournament. In the future, records will be broken in\n        vanishingly small increments, not because there are no more great\n        athletes, but because technology is helping to optimize the performance\n        of all.\n—EILEEN IMADA\nViewpoint: No, technological advances in sports such as tennis, golf,\n        and track and field have not supplanted the athletic achievements of the\n        participants in those sports.\nSports have an intimate quality that makes the use of technology seem\n        too intrusive. However, the use of technology in sports is not new and\n        has led to many benefits for mankind. In fact, in some ways, these\n        advances in technology help to justify the expense of time and money\n        that we invest in sports. Probably the greatest and most persistent\n        concern about technology and sports is that it diminishes the prestige\n        of athletes by blurring the distinction between their accomplishments\n        and those that are made possible because of the technology.\nIt certainly is the case that in the hands of a major leaguer an\n        aluminum bat becomes a lethal weapon. Not only is an aluminum bat a more\n        consistent tool than a wooden bat, but it also creates more force,\n        allowing balls to be driven further and harder. In fact aluminum bat,\n        although allowed in college play, is banned in most professional\n        leagues, including the major leagues. Similar concerns have been raised\n        about the differences created in tennis when larger metal rackets\n        totally replaced wooden rackets at the professional level. And\n        professional golf has put specific limits upon the materials that can be\n        used for golf clubs.\nIt is unlikely that anyone would insist on professional football players\n        going back to the days when they wore leather helmets on the field.\n        Similarly, there is no move to prevent athletes from improving their\n        nutrition or engaging in exercise, often with the most advance\n        resistance equipment and monitoring instruments. So where does the\n        controversy lie?\nObjections to Sports Technology\nThere are two situations in which the move to new technology is most\n        opposed. First, when it is \n         believed that the \"integrity\" of the game has been put in\n        jeopardy. Often the aesthetics and fun of the competition are keenly\n        dependent upon such things as the dimensions of the field, the bounce of\n        the ball, the height of the net, and other factors that developed over\n        time and have proven their value. The second objection to new\n        technologies is based primarily upon concerns over the health of the\n        athlete. For instance, performance drugs, particularly street level\n        performance drugs, have already demonstrated that they can cause illness\n        and shorten the life spans of athletes. However, there is no doubt that\n        some performance drugs can provide a margin of victory. This use of\n        chemicals is perhaps the most difficult technological question that\n        sports faces today. Looking at the Olympics, we see that there has been\n        a continual struggle to set standards of fairness and safety, yet there\n        is strong evidence that some athletes continue to seek an edge in this\n        way, and, in fact, may be a step ahead of those trying to test them.\nThere is no question that integrity of the game argument holds in many\n        cases. The same sort of caution should be shown in the introduction of\n        new technology as when modifications are made, say, to the size of the\n        strike zone in baseball or in the limits to roughness allowed in\n        football. In cases where it could damage the aesthetics of the game or\n        too abruptly separate today's athletes from past players, it\n        should be rejected.\nAnd while it is reasonable for athletes to assume some risk in their\n        professions (in fact, it is expected as part of the game in many\n        events), there are levels of unreasonable risk, and there are occasions\n        when risk can be easily prevented. In the cases of performance drugs as\n        they exist today, it is reasonable to protect athletes from the economic\n        pressures that might force them to submit their bodies to unreasonable\n        risk. On the other hand, we have many instances where technology can and\n        does reduce the probability of injury to athletes. For instance, the\n        chances of injuring one's arm in tennis go up significantly if\n        one uses an old wooden racket. And it's obvious that the\n        protective equipment we have today is of great benefit to athletes. No\n        one would want to go back to playing baseball without batting helmets,\n        or playing football without proper padding.\nInjuries can be further minimized by the use of ergonomics, sports\n        psychology, and sports medicine. For instance, a better understanding of\n        ergonomics can help the pitcher move more fluidly and spare his body\n        from injuries, even crippling ones. Sports psychology can help athletes\n        perform better, and sports medicine has given us new approaches to\n        treating injuries and to maintaining physical health.\nValue of Sports and the Role of the Athlete\nTo show that technology has supplanted athletes would require proving\n        that the value provided by athletes has shifted in some way to\n        technologies or away from the sport. So what value does sports promise?\n        While different people might appreciate sports for different reasons,\n        clearly sports provide entertainment, celebrity, instruction and\n        development, commerce, aesthetics, and stories. Is the athlete's\n        role in any of these degraded by technology?\nEntertainment.\nOverall, the public's attention to sports, as measured by their\n        investments in time and money, has never been higher. The status of\n        individual sports may wax and wane depending upon a number of factors.\n        One of these, of course, is how much fun the sport is, and this may be\n        related to how closely it connects with daily life. For instance, it has\n        been observed that in times of peace Americans tend to gravitate toward\n        baseball, while in times of war they tend to gravitate toward football.\n        Probably the most dependable predictor of whether a specific sport will\n        be of interest is how well it keeps up with the pace of daily life (one\n        reason given for the growing popularity of soccer over baseball among\n        the young). Life's pace has continued to increase, and technology\n        has helped to increase the pace of sports with faster serves, better\n        runs, and quicker race cars. Technology also helps athletes demonstrate\n        their full potential, so all manner of records are continually broken.\n        Judging from the press attention to such feats, it would appear that\n        these are appreciated by the public, and that they add to the excitement\n        of sports.\nCelebrity.\nSports provides us with people to identify with, cheer for, and boo.\n        Often our greatest attraction is to people that we know, people that we\n        essentially share a history with. Technology can often displace these\n        people if they do not respond well to the changes in the game. (One\n        crisis in golf came when a younger generation quickly overcame the\n        older, familiar players, and gate receipts declined.) However, it can\n        also lengthen careers as better conditioning, new surgical treatments,\n        and better medication make it possible for highly skilled athletes to\n        have long careers. With effects on both sides of the ledger, it might be\n        difficult to determine whether technology, overall, degrades the star\n        power of athletes.\nInstruction and Development.\nSports often provides instruction in many areas. People often come to a\n        better understanding of the possibilities for improving their health by\n        observing sports and hearing details of sports treatments and training.\n        Similarly, sports psychology has helped people to appreciate the\n        connection between mental health and achievement, if not happiness.\n        Strategists, particularly in business, have often relied on sports to\n        provide analogies. And much of the original intent of sports was as\nOlympic gold medalist Marion Jones in a full-body running suit. (\n© Duomo/Corbis.\nReproduced by permission .)\npractice for warfare and other conflicts. This may, in some cases,\n        still have value today.\nGiven the pressure for success in sports, it is not surprising that\n        advances in medicine, nutrition, and therapy have their origins in the\n        world of sports. Since sports can accelerate the toll that life takes on\n        the human body—wearing down joints and demanding more of muscles\n        and ligaments—sports medicine has found particular application\n        among the large and growing population of older people.\nSports also provides a market that supports the development of new\n        materials and the study of the physics of athletic equipment. Helmets\n        have been improved in football, and safety equipment is honed to\n        perfection in auto racing.\nCommerce.\nSports, even amateur sports today, is big business. The sales\n        opportunities for athletes who have been on the scene for a long time\n        and who can sell to his or her peers are enhanced. In addition, the\n        updating of equipment, which can be recommended by athletes, can make\n        sports more lucrative for athletes. This has been seen especially in the\n        case of athletic shoes. Technology here can support the extension of\n        careers, and, in a world where wealth is often admired, raise the\n        respect for athletes. In can also damage the images of athletes who\n        might be seen as having \"sold out\" or who have extravagant\n        lifestyles that seem wholly unlike those of their fans, making them\n        difficult to identify with. However, the role of technology here would\n        seem to be minimal. Ticket prices and strikes are the main targets of\n        fan dis-approbation when commerce lays too heavy a hand on the game.\nAesthetics.\nAt its best, sports is an artistic endeavor. The motions of athletes\n        challenge those of the best dancers. The sounds of the crowd or the\n        crack of a bat or even the gasp of the player surging over the goal line\n        can rival music. The interaction between players on the field can be\n        both intricate and intellectually satisfying. It is difficult to\n        quantify the effects of technology on the aesthetics of sports.\n        Certainly, there is no artistic merit to a performance that has been\n        compromised by equipment failure.\nThere is a large overlap between aesthetics and the\n        \"integrity\" of the game. We want to know that the\n        achievements are real, not faked. Elegance should not come from fancy\n        camera work or hidden wires. It must be about the body and the mind, and\n        it must be connected to the traditions of the game. Replace baseballs\n        with over-sized golf balls, and you'll get more home runs. But\n        one would miss the timing, rhythm, and judgment of a\n        \"real\" home run. And the game itself will no longer be the\n        one that Babe Ruth played. Have sports ever stepped over the line? The\n        argument can certainly be made that they have. But not far and not\n        often. As much as synthetic grass fields are disparaged in baseball,\n        they have never been as controversial as a nontechnical change, the\n        introduction of the designated hitter. Free substitution made more\n        significant changes to football than any amount of body armor. The best\n        evidence that the integrity of sports has, overall, been maintained is\n        that history is an important point of comparison in the world of sports,\n        and fans continue to cheer for the achievements of the best.\nStories.\nThere may be no greater contribution of sports than the stories it tells\n        about itself and about us. The triumphs and tragedies of our heroes in\n        sports provide us with lessons on how we should or should not lead our\n        lives. They also inspire us and sometimes provide guidance for our\n        lives. Just by virtue of the careers it lengthens, technology changes\n        the nature of these stories: there are more novels, fewer short stories.\nAgainst these positives is, again, the question of the integrity of the\n        game. Is this drama true? Or is the game \"fixed?\" The 1919\n        Black Sox scandal stills lives in memory because the public wants, even\n        needs, an honest game. A technical marvel, such as an advanced rudder,\n        might take the America's Cup to Australia, but a resulting movie\n        script, if honest, would more likely deal with the engineers than the\n        sailors. It is possible to take the athletes out of the story with\n        technology that actually changes the game, and it is the responsibility\n        of the commissioners, \n         referees, and judges to keep that from happening. Based on the\n        reactions of fans, they are doing a pretty fair job, and the\n        appreciation of athletes' accomplishments seems to be secure.\nThere are many ways that a sport can lose its currency with fans: It can\n        be replaced by another sport that better reflects the spirit of the\n        times. It can lose the fans' trust and affection through\n        corruption, the attitude of athletes, or disaster (such as the death of\n        a popular athlete). It can even be outlawed, as has happened with\n        cockfighting and has been threatened with contact sports from time to\n        time. But the tools athletes use and the advances they take advantage of\n        in medicine, training, nutrition, and psychology have not presented any\n        serious threats to sports. As long as the integrity of the game and the\n        safety of athletes are not seriously violated by technological advances,\n        athletes will still be the heroes of the games.\n—PETER ANDREWS\nFurther Reading\nAkins, Anthony. \"Golfers Tee Into the Future.\" The Futurist (March/April 1994): 39-42.\nCanfield, Jack, ed.

The work allows managing evaluative information of different sports disciplines about the level of physical, technical, and tactical preparation and other aspects of sports preparation that access to identify characteristics of sports performance of the athlete. A descriptive and application research approach was assumed that through a training plan allows to capture and generate key information for the identification and characterization of the most important aspects of the control and monitoring of the athlete as they are actors (individual, institutional, corporate), that includes elements of personal data, results of physical, technical, tactical tests and thus, having reliable data that allow us to predict results in different sports competitions As results the specific requirements expressed in user stories were obtained and the strengths and weaknesses of the athletes understudy taking into account that the social impact is to be able to use sports development mechanisms that help the orientation and selection of sports talent found in the different slums and neighborhoods of the region which will allow through sport a comprehensive education and environmental care through a sports and pedagogical process that allows it to grow economically not only in the sale of services that can be generated with the use of state of the art technology but with the economic projection of what can be worth a high-performance athlete. In conclusion, reliable information was obtained, for the realization and control of different training plans generating inputs for decision-making in the approach of different possibilities seeking to solve very particular aspects of the computerized and disciplinary management of sport, the use of technology applied to sports training represents a significant advance in reducing costs, time and processes in the training of athletes with a view to professional sports.\nAvailable via license: CC BY 3.0\nContent may be subject to copyright.\n... After much deliberation, the score was increased, promoting Nemov to the third position (Reuters, 2004). In response to the problems in the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, a new scoring system was put in place in 2006 with an open-ended scoring system for the D score (Turner, 2014). Nevertheless, Green and Allen (1984, p. 47) suggest that \"where there is a judged sport, there is always controversy\".  ...\n... It is worth noting that with increased professionalisation and commercialisation of elite sports, success has become more important, and this corresponds with a lower freedom of expression and joy that is often part of sport participation at grassroots and youth levels (Cashmore, 2010). It would not be surprising to see gymnastics evolve in this direction, since the introduction of technology has seen a number of sports change over time (Collins & Evans, 2011; Vera-Rivera et al, 2019).

Many innovations in the fields of sports have happened because technology has made them possible.\nIn the house or at work we are constantly bombarded with technology to the extent that today we don’t give it a second thought, it is part and parcel of life. Sports equipment – a relatively young offshoot of technology seems to be growing leaps and bounds.\nSports technology has changed the face of sports as we knew it. The application of technology in sport facility design has yielded real changes in terms of athlete use, spectator comfort and usable life span.\nADVERTISEMENTS:\nTechnology has meant that we can now calculate the speed of an athlete to fractions of a second. It has meant that an athlete can now win or lose despite a photo finish.\nCameras capturing images to the second have made it possible to replay every action on the field to enable correct decisions. It has meant that games are now fairer. The element of chance and luck has been almost removed.\nSports equipment refers to a large amount of equipment which is used in sports. Starting with the bats, and balls, and rackets to the shoes and socks and glasses there are a lot of things that come under the umbrella of Sports equipments.\nADVERTISEMENTS:\nAbout 25 years ago tennis rackets were made from wood, with ash, maple etc. leading the way. Later in the sixties metal frames were introduced. Today composite rackets are the rage because of the efficiency they offer in accelerating the ball across the net and in terms of the dangerous vibrations that lead to tennis elbow. For example Bobby Riggs with his 1939 wooden racket, would have no chance against Pete Sampras armed with an oversized composite racket with an enlarged “sweet spot”, although Bobby Riggs was an excellent player.\nThe shoes today offer greater grip and have better cushioning which helps prevent, heel damage. Sports clothing today is made of fabric that is sweat resistant and wrinkle free. The discovery of Lycra has meant the athletes can stretch better, run better and compete better.\nSpecialized sports equipment which hits particular muscle groups has meant the athletes can train specific muscles. Today sports equipment is necessary if one wants to compete internationally. Though talent still plays a big role in the success of athletes, sports equipment is what gives them the extra edge.\nWith fitness having finally moved past the fad stage, °ne can truly say that sports equipment is here to stay. Treadmills, elliptical cycles, rowing machines, steppers, are the new mantra. Sports equipment for home use is a big market today. Home gyms alone recorded a 30 percent increase in sale in 2006 over the year 2000.\nADVERTISEMENTS:\nThe popularity of home gyms is partially because homeowners prefer to work out at home. It saves on commuting time, it saves on monthly gym membership costs, and it gives users the liberty to exercise when the fancy takes them. It has meant that parents can keep an eye on their children while working out at home.\nHome gym equipment market which is relatively new seems poised to clock astonishing sales in the next couple of years. What was a fitness fad is now a fitness commitment and it is this commitment that has speared the sports equipment industry.\nHome ››\nCookie\nDuration\nDescription\ncookielawinfo-checkbox-analytics\n11 months\nThis cookie is set by GDPR Cookie Consent plugin.

Probably not. When it comes to sports, it’s not easy to find a link between technology and sports, but the truth is, technology is present throughout the industry. From heart monitors for tracking athlete’s heart rate and body condition to police radar guns for measuring running speed, these simple tools have become the greatest game changers in sports training and competitions.\nThe role of technology in sports has increased rapidly. Each modern device comes with specific benefits that made every trainer’s life easier, from evaluating an athletes’ performance and helping coaches develop a game strategy and training program. Trainers use the data to plan training sessions and use devices to facilitate training routines. Even the whole experience of watching sports competitions made it easy for sports fans to follow their favorite athlete and stay updated on the latest sports events.\nWith technology, it’s easy to administer and officiate sports when human capabilities are insufficient. It has affected different aspects of sports from the public profile, viewing, and performance. In this article, we’ll discuss the role of technology in revolutionizing sports training and how recent innovations changed the state of sports and technology.\nTracks health performance\nWhether you’re doing sports to prepare for a competition or simply work out for health and fitness reasons, using the right equipment is essential. In the old days, people settle for make-shift tools and raw materials such as wood and rubber as alternative sports equipment. Today, technology has opened limitless possibilities to access modern training equipment and high accuracy tech devices that provide personalized training techniques (e.g., air bikes and treadmills). Gone are those days of measuring distances with a vehicle or running hundreds of laps in large football fields.\nUsing sensors attached to a body part has helped sports trainers monitor and measure performance in real-time. Some examples are smart clothing that monitors athlete’s physical condition, such as biometric data, pulse rate, muscle stretch, temperature, physical movement, and heart rhythm. Athletes and trainers can easily access the data by transmitting it via Bluetooth connection.\nMeanwhile, smartwatches are ideal for tracking daily performance, including the number of steps and heart rate. You can sync the data with a fitness application to have a record of your daily progress.\nSmartphones today offer several tracking options to access different fitness applications and workout activities depending on your preferred exercise level and current body condition. After the training, the application will show your progress and how the training affected your overall performance and health. Other applications offer suggested meal plans or a daily diet to supplement your training.\nImproves accuracy\nHave you ever watched a sports science program where athletes take part in science experiments to test their skills and push their performance to its limit? These programs use advanced measuring devices that allow athletes to monitor what went wrong or ways to improve their performance.\nModern technology is proven useful for both professional or amateur athletes in enhancing their gameplay. Swing analysis and video projections are tools used by players to analyze their movements and performance, allowing them to do better in the next competition.\nTechnology also helps athletes enhance their athletic movements. Modern divers and swimmers are using sensors to measure effort and time metrics. They monitor swimming movements, such as dive angle, hydrodynamics, leg movement, and rotational speed. Observing these movements helps them evaluate performance-related actions and the type of adjustments needed to be done to increase their speed.\nReduces injuries and enhances performance\nOne of the most essential advantages of technology in sports training is the reduced number of injury cases and the ability to identify possible incidents. Since sports often involve rigorous activities and plenty of body contact, sustaining injuries have become a part of every training and competition. But thanks to technology, sports professionals found a way to protect themselves from unforeseen incidents.\nOne example is the invention of the concussion helmet. In sports games such as baseball and football, players are constantly concerned about their safety, especially in sustaining head injuries such as concussions. Meanwhile, helmets in motorsports also proved useful in reducing unwanted neck and head injuries across the road.\nWith a concussion helmet and other safety equipment, players can play with much confidence regardless of the intensity of the game or training. In fact, sports companies continue to develop safety equipment with ergonomic aspects to improve athlete’s performance and adjust to the increased training demands.\nToday, amateur and professional sports organizations have embraced the latest tech innovations to protect athletes and improve sports performance. The items above are just a few of the reasons how technology changed the entire sports industry. As tech companies continue to develop sports tech innovations, we’re likely to witness more technological advances in sports both at the leisure and competition level.", "More than training | Nature Materials\nPublished: 24 July 2012\nMore than training\nNature Materials 11 , 651 (2012)Cite this article\n1311 Accesses\n2 Citations\n2 Altmetric\nMetrics\nHighly engineered materials can play a pivotal role both in boosting the performance of athletes and in stimulating the innate repair of tissue damaged by sports injuries.\nThe face of sports has changed dramatically since the days of the first Olympic Games in ancient Greece. The earliest competitions were held on sand and encompassed little more than foot races. The 2012 Olympics in London, in contrast, will be a display of elite performances across many different sports, which is to a large extent made possible by progress in materials science and technology.\nSince the first modern Olympics in 1896, performance in sports as diverse as the 100 m sprint, pole vault and cycling has increased significantly, by 24–221% depending on the type of sport 1. This progress is due to a multitude of factors, especially improved training methods and the early identification of promising talent. In addition to constant performance monitoring and personalized training plans, however, athletes have also benefited from highly improved materials. In fact, some of the largest increases in performance have been seen in sports that rely heavily on equipment.\nOlympic one-hour cycling, for example, has seen a performance increase of 221% over 111 years 1, which is largely a result of the replacement of heavy metal frames by light carbon fibre composites (Fig. 1 ). At more modest levels, many other sports such as javelin, skiing and tennis have also benefited from highly engineered materials. In a Commentary in this Focus issue, Mike Caine, Kim Blair and Mike Vasquez review this evolution of sports technology 2. They illustrate how the design of poles for vaulting moved from wood to aluminium and then on to glass fibre composites, and how each of these changes led to new records. Likewise, improved soft materials such as synthetic fabrics now provide athletes with superior heat management and, in the case of swimsuits, viable reductions in friction.\nFigure 1: Engineered materials such as carbon fibre composites have increased the performance of athletes in track cycling.\n© NATIONAL ARCHIVES UK; © GETTY IMAGES\na, Cycle race in 1893. b, Cyclists at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.\nFull size image\nIn view of such progress, critics have coined the term technology doping. For swimming, the emergence of full-body coverage and laminate-based suits led to the tumbling of numerous world records 3. As many as 94% of the swimming races at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing were won by athletes wearing swimwear manufacturer Speedo's LZR Racer suit, which included polyurethane structures for body compression. In the course of the following year and after further storming success, the international swimming association eventually tightened equipment regulations, effectively excluding laminates from the group of allowed materials.\nIn an Interview with Tom Waller, the head of Speedo's research and development facility Aqualab, we discuss how the company has adapted to this new playing field 4. Instead of laminates, they now focus on complex textiles and an integrated design that leverages the fluid dynamics around the entire set of equipment worn by the athlete. Likewise, the banning of zippers and fasteners means that getting dressed for competitive swimming requires considerable preparation, and that female swimmers now need to get into their suit through the arm hole.\nIt is this dynamic interplay between regulatory bodies and resourceful researchers that makes sports technology an innovation hotbed. Regardless of the pros and cons, elite athletes crucially rely on technological progress to compete. For example, high-performance wheelchairs for competitors in the Paralympics contain lightweight metal alloys and need to be designed with an eye on aerodynamics. Also, when sports injuries occur, all athletes can benefit from advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine to stimulate the innate repair of bone and cartilaginous tissue, such as that of the meniscus of the knee joint. In a Commentary reviewing progress in biomaterials for tissue repair, Paul Ducheyne, Robert Mauch and Douglas Smith discuss developments in implantable polymeric and ceramic scaffolds for the delivery of growth factors and cells that support and stimulate the rapid repair of damaged bone and cartilage lesions 5. They also discuss preclinical strategies for the repair of traumatic spinal cord injuries, which unfortunately can arise from accidents in the practice of sports such as horseback riding, football or diving.\nWith improvements in orthopaedics, the line between the Olympics and Paralympics may become increasingly blurry. This trend has become most evident in the case of the South African runner Oscar Pistorius, who has been fighting to compete in the Olympics despite his two lower-leg prostheses. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) had initially banned him from participating in standard competitions in view of possible advantages from his light and flexible carbon fibre limbs. However, after numerous biomechanical and physiological studies, the Court of Arbitration for Sport eventually overruled the IAAF's decision and paved Pistorius's way to the Olympics.\nNo matter how far sports technology progresses, physiological predisposition 6 and biomechanics 7 already distinguish elite athletes from the average individual who is merely in good shape. Further improvements with the help of high-performance materials and developments in sporting equipment should be welcomed as long as they are accessible to every competitor and accepted by the key stakeholders in sports. After all, the goal of technology should be to enable every sportsperson to get the best out of their talent.\nReferences\nHaake, S. J. J.

On the contrary, technology makes sport more interesting.\nTechnological advancement is a natural process, and, with its introduction into a sport, athletes simply become “better.” This process is clearly exemplified by changes to, for instance, the material of vaulting poles, which were initially made of wood, bamboo, and metal. Before the change occurred, improvements in training rapidly delivered new Olympic and world records in the sport, which, after some time, saturated and started to enter a steady state. Once the pole material was changed to fiber composites, the process began to repeat itself, with athletes achieving rapidly improving records.\nIn other equipment, such as monocoque racing bicycle frames and buoyant swimsuits, this same effect was reversed by rules soon after the changes were introduced. Bike design returned to the conventional diamond frames, and swimsuits reverted to less buoyant, and more permeable, materials. Yet, independent of whether or not rules are imposed on technological advances, sports technology is almost always about the same principle: energy.\nSports performance is defined by the energy produced by the athlete and released into the environment. The energy must be exclusively produced by the athlete, and must not come from somewhere else (e.g. an external energy source). However, not all of the energy produced by the athlete is necessarily released into the environment. Common sources of energy loss (non-conservative, non-recoverable energy) are: external friction (e.g. sliding friction in skiing or rolling friction in cycling); internal friction (any energy absorbed by materials such as viscous polymers and foams); aerodynamic drag (produced, for instance, by sprinting, speed skating, cycling, or skiing); hydrodynamic drag (produced in sports like swimming or rowing); sound (in impacts); heat (frictional energy converted to thermal energy); vibrations (of equipment and surfaces); and the energy required for stability (unstable ski boots, broken laces of figure-skating boots, etc.).\nStory continues\nOur goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

The video camera is perhaps the single most important development in coaching in the modern era of sport.\nElectronic timing controlled by computers is employed to measure  performance times of athletes in a great many sports including Athletics, Cycling, Skiing, Bobsled, Triathlon and many more. In the case of Athletics, the electronic timing also measures the athlete's reaction time to the start gun in case the athlete moves too early in the blocks.\nThe Force Platform is an apparatus placed under the feet of the athlete and measures their 'ground reaction force'. This is useful in sports such as Weightlifting and enables measurement of force and acceleration throughout the athlete's performance of a lift. Curiously, the measurement of force is due to the miniscule  change in properties of crystals upon which the platform rests.\nHawkeye, a computer system first used in 2001 for showing the trajectory of a cricket ball has made an immeasurable difference to the sport of Cricket. Hawkeye produces all manner of statistical analysis such as ball speed, ball pitch on the wicket and trajectory of the ball after bounce. Hawkeye is now used in Tennis to assist in determining whether a shot is \"in\" or \"out\". The analysis of sport performance provided by Hawkeye has  greatly enhanced the  spectator's knowledge and involvement.\nAs a result of miniaturized video cameras, spectators are also now able to  witness sport performance in ways that previously was not possible. Video cameras can be placed in places such as racing cars,  cricket stumps, goal posts, and even on the athlete themselves.\nSporting equipment continually undergoing research and development to improve sporting performance. Some of the best examples include:\nFully body swim wear, made of polyurethane, made a huge impact in the 2008 Olympics only to be banned a year later because it was too obviously making a difference to sporting performance.\nKevlar fibre (5 times stronger than steel yet lighter, used in the manufacture of sails, bicycle tires, football boots, tennis rackets, helmets, body armour and more.\nRaving cycles and rowing shells made of lightweight but strong materials, and minimise drag though the air or water.\nSome people decry the use of technology to improve sports performance but in reality it is inevitable. The research and development of sport apparatus and apparel is an industry in itself which creates opportunity for investment and employment.\nCopyright and Disclaimer | About the author Leo Isaac | Email Webmaster", "Athletic performance has been improving steadily for decades | The Economist\nDaily chart\nAthletic performance has been improving steadily for decades\nWhizzy equipment and clever training techniques have helped boost human strength and speed to breathtaking levels\nApr 23rd 2021\nWHEN DOUG HEPBURN, a Canadian weightlifter billed as the “world’s strongest man”, bench-pressed 400lbs in 1950, it was a world record. Today it is routine. In powerlifting competitions around the world, competitors now regularly lie back, grip their barbells, and press more than 700lbs above their chests. Such rapid gains would seem inconceivable were it not happening across the world of sport. Around the time Mr Hepburn set his weightlifting record, the best marathon time was a shade under two and a half hours. Today elite marathoners routinely finish the 42.2km (26.2-mile) race in scarcely more than two (see chart).\nWhat accounts for these improvements? Technology is part of the story. Lighter and springier running shoes can shave minutes off race times, a development that is partly responsible for recent record-breaking performances. In the weight room, powerlifters have boosted their performance with the help of “equipped powerlifting” gear such as belts, squat suits and bench shirts—thick synthetic getups made of polyester or spandex worn during competition—which support powerlifters’ joints and help them lift more weight. These outfits started to become more common around the year 2000, when bench-press and squat numbers steeply increased and competitors began to train with the new equipment.\nBut new gadgets can only go so far. Training matters, too. Marathon performance, for example, is strongly correlated with training intensity. Speedier marathoners tend to run farther, faster, and more frequently in training than do slowpokes. Such intensive regimens became common among runners only after the second world war, when marathon times first started their steady fall. In the postwar era, sports science also discovered the concept of periodisation: year-round training programmes broken into distinct phases and focused on achieving top performance at competition time. Periodised programmes are now de rigueur for runners and powerlifters alike.\nScience has continued to do its part to beef up strongmen and give runners a tailwind. In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers dispelled popular myths (such as the idea that weightlifting would immobilise the joints of “muscle-bound” strongmen), developed new measurement instruments, and paved the way for coaches who deploy scientific research in the hope of improving athletic performance. Researchers figured out that weightlifting workouts with heavier weights and fewer repetitions improved peak strength. They also learned that running economy—the amount of energy expended by a runner at a given speed—which is vital for marathon performance, can be improved with high-intensity interval and resistance training.\nHow much better, faster and stronger can athletes get? It depends on the sport. The current marathon world record time is just a hair over two hours. Some experts reckon it could be decades before times fall below the two-hour mark. Weightlifting records, meanwhile, will continue to fall. Oliver Lee Bateman, a writer and powerlifter, calls recent improvements in bench press and deadlift “absolutely insane”. At such high levels of performance, he says, “any gains whatsoever boggle the mind.”\nReuse this content The Trust Project\nOff the Charts\nTaking you behind the scenes of our data journalism\nDirectly to your inbox every week\nMore from Graphic detail\nIf it spreads, it’s read\n2021’s biggest stories were covid-19 and America’s presidential transition\nDaily chart\nTest results in American schools plummeted during the pandemic\nDaily chart\nYoung Americans are souring on Joe Biden", "Modern Techniques and Technologies Applied to Training and Performance Monitoring\nModern Techniques and Technologies Applied to Training and Performance Monitoring\nInt J Sports Physiol Perform. 2017 Apr;12(Suppl 2):S263-S272. doi: 10.1123/ijspp.2016-0405.

Modern coaches are shifting from reliance on personal memory, experience, and opinion to evidence from collected training-load data. Training-load monitoring may hold vital information for developing systems of monitoring that follow the training process with such precision that both performance prediction and day-to-day management of training become adjuncts to preparation and performance. Time-series data collection and analyses in sport are still in their infancy, with considerable efforts being applied in \"big data\" analytics, models of the appropriate variables to monitor, and methods for doing so. Training monitoring has already garnered important applications but lacks a theoretical framework from which to develop further.

Looking back at it the radio was just the beginning and no one could predict how technology would evolve after that. Even though sports were being televised, the broadcasters did not have the greatest amount of resources. There were often only one or two cameras that were used to broadcast a game. As the years past new and improved cameras were developed that enabled the viewer to enjoy their viewing experience. Cameras were not the only things to change. Broadcasts began to provide features that would allow the fans to have a better understanding of what was going on. A prime example being the yellow first down line in the NFL or graphics displaying up to the minute scores and stats on the bottom of your screen.

Name an industry and it’s probable that those within it have become well-acquainted with a sentiment of uncertainty and disruption , global sports is no different.\nSome might argue that sport is making it’s first steps back to a level of normality, others would have you believe that we’ve settled into the fabled ‘new normal’ and the balanced people out there would suggest that we’re likely somewhere between the two. What no one would argue against is that the way sport works and the way the interaction between sport and fan works is vastly different to the start of 2020.\nAs fans begin to return to stadiums and sports events, which weren’t given a hope in 2020 finally play out, we took the opportunity to get a gauge on where sports media and sports tech is and where it’s heading. Stats Perform interviewed over 150 sports-related organizations, located around the world, and from a variety of industry verticals, to identify the changing trends in fan engagement. Here’s what we found out.\nCOVID is an accelerator but it’s not an instigator.\nThere’s no doubt that COVID-19 and a global pandemic has changed the interaction between any sports property and their fans. That said, this change seems to reflect more of a quickening in the importance of digital media rather than a new idea in itself. The emergence of a global fanbase to complement a more local following has been commonplace for several years now. That emergence, and the growth opportunity which came with it placed a massive emphasis on digital media as the place where fans interacted with their favourite sport. Given that fans were largely unable to enjoy a live stadium experience over the last 18 months, what COVID-19 appears to have done is quicken the adoption of consumption via digital means as a result of the lack of a valid alternative.\nThis change seems to suggest some level of permanence; 61% of stakeholders across the sports media industry  said that their organisation is moving in a different direction than was initially planned for 2021. A further 74% said that COVID-19 had given their organisation new insight into the future of sports.\nContent remains king.\nThe content which sits at the heart of any fan experience remains a key ingredient – content creators need to make sure they’re delivering the right content regardless of the platform, be that during an OTT broadcast or on social media. 26% of broadcasters  cited a need for in-depth statistics and sports analytics as what their customers value most.\nWith any question about content, it’s hard not to ask where the focus should be, on breadth or depth? For many, the answer appears to be both: diversifying coverage while simultaneously bolstering growth of core offerings. That can then be divided into two core areas: what you’re covering and how you’re covering it. Sports data and advanced metrics are now a staple of the fan experience as is video which continues to dominate fans consumption. Both of those look to continue their growth, as fans demand more detail and near-instant video coverage.\nIn terms of new sports, half of all respondents said that they were looking to break into e-sports coverage this year. Esports is predicted to nearly double its viewership, to 646 million in 2023, from where it stood in 2017. Given esports’ strong penetration amongst late teens and early twenties, a coveted demographic amongst rights holders, brands and sponsors alike, it’s no surprise to see it become an increasingly hot property.\nTechnology and innovation can’t be separated\nContent remains king but 72% of respondents said that their organization was looking into investing in new technology this year. Gut feeling would lead you to believe that those technological focuses would be on the use of immersive technologies such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, a major theme of any sports media conference over the last few years. That said, the focus is much more fundamental than that; How do we deliver the right content to the individual at any given point. Personalisation, it would seem is what content distributors regard as their big ticket to opening up revenue streams.\nA new era of live engagement\nThe match experience remains the centrepiece of fan engagement. Unsurprisingly, this is most heightened in betting where revenues are tied to in-play markets. The broadcast sector is naturally aligned to this trend as well and is set to be transformed over the coming years through more detailed real-time analysis, mixed reality, virtual reality, and more. It is no surprise that 65% of broadcasters who responded to our survey regarded themselves as pioneers in sports media. It’s also no surprise that betting and broadcast sectors both prioritised live engagement over content which runs across the week.\nWith competition for sports rights becoming fiercer, pressures rising, and the marketplace becoming ever more crowded, differentiating the broadcast offering by surfacing timely and relevant insights is key to building and securing an audience that will satisfy key rights holders. Fuelling all these experiences is a reliance on the content which sits in them and how that is accessed.\nNaturally, these themes all create challenges to any content producers’ business model; How do you produce enough content to satisfy a hungry sports fan? How do they provide the depth they’re after? How do they stand out in a busy and competitive market? Naturally, these challenges lean towards an emerging role for artificial intelligence and machine learning. These technologies enable media companies in the world of sport to produce more detailed content, to do so at scale and to deliver it to sports fans in a way which works for them.\nOur research report on Fan Engagement in 2021 outlines these trends and more.

As these changes occur, it is critical for sports teams to recognize the value and importance of fan engagement by evolving alongside them.\nIn recent years, teams have dedicated more time and resources toward cultivating a strong relationship with their fans. Teams and the leagues are investing in creating a personalized fan experience; allowing teams to better understand and better serve their fanbase.\nTapping into innovative digital technologies allows you to be at the forefront of strengthening fan engagement on social media, inside stadiums, and fans watching any number of devices. We will cover a number of exciting ways in which technology is helping to improve fan engagement in sports.\nStatistics and Analytics\nOn September 1, 2018, the Jacksonville Jaguars faced the New York Giants in East Rutherford, New Jersey to begin their season. This was no normal game, however. This was the first NFL game in which fans could place in-game wagers online through a sanctioned mobile betting app. Online betting and the average fans demand for in-game information and data will only become more prominent.\nOnline betting, fantasy sports, and a genuine curiosity in the games they love have increased fans’ demand for live statistics and analytics in real time. Teams should lean into this desire, using technology to provide the fans with more data while they watch games.\nLeaderboards, up-to-the-minute statistical updates, data visualization, and the capability for in-stadium betting takes the entertainment experience to another level. Using technology to bring data closer to fans is critical to maintain and grow fan engagement.\nFan Relationship Management\nFew demographic groups place as high a premium on loyalty as sports fans. They remain loyal to their teams and they like to have their loyalty rewarded. Hence, it is imperative to leverage technology to manage relationships with fans to maximize benefits.\nCommunity tools like websites and apps make it easier for fans to receive and consume vital event information. This includes any kind of information about an upcoming game from start times to information on food and beverage options within the stadium. Chatbots and voice technology can also play a key role by guiding fans through the website or app and addressing their concerns quickly and efficiently.\nGPS-powered devices are another key technology that can provide such features as geofencing to either offer rewards points or send targeted offers to fans within a designated region. Loyalty programs provide great rewards for passionate fans who attend games and follow teams by other means in addition to enticing them to attend games more frequently. Loyalty programs are fairly simple to implement and can be deployed via web sites or mobile apps.\nLeveraging technology helps make the fan experience convenient and generally more pleasant — which leads to increased fan engagement and a better relationship between fans and teams.\nContent Curation\nSocial media has become a driving force in the sports industry. Teams and athletes invest in extending their online presence by developing and promoting team-based content to stay connected to fans while they are at an event and post event.\nSocial networks such as Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are great platforms to stream video highlights of your team’s games — either following or during an event. For fans in the stadium, this deepens the connection to the game n. According to MVPIndex, since the start of 2017, posts published by entities from the “Big 5” U.S. sports leagues (MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL, and NHL) and NASCAR have generated 16.7 billion engagements. Posting video content isn’t the only way to engage your fans via social networking, however. You can post polls, hold AMAs in which players directly interact with fans either through posts or livestreaming videos, and respond to in-game fan questions or concerns.\nLivestreaming is an even better way to give your fans an all-access showcase of your team’s games or event experiences. Creating compelling videos recorded from field level perspectives, unavailable to the television viewer, can improve engagement by making fans watching at home feel like they are at the game. 30% of fans stream games to their phones or tablets — it makes sense to appeal to this fairly sizable demographic.\nYou can also produce content highlighting the strengths and off the field interests of your players — humanizing them and increasing the likelihood your fans will want to spend their entertainment dollars to see them play.\nThe partnership between Snapchat and NHL is one of the most conspicuous examples of how teams and leagues take advantage of the technology to deliver the ultimate fan experience. NBA went a step further and became one of WarnerMedia’s initial partners in their Content Innovation Lab. Their goal is to “explore areas including utilizing AT&T’s IoT infrastructure, connected car partners and connected environments across stadiums, airports and cities to re-imagine localized content and fan experiences, as well as utilizing a vast array of creative talent to bring the immersive game experience beyond the court.”\nNext Wave of Entertainment\nAugmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are increasingly being used in the sports industry to create new experiences for audiences allowing fans sitting at home to feel like they have a front row seat. Interactive games within your team’s arena or stadium can even put the fan in the middle of the action as a participant — albeit a virtual one. There are many great examples currently available, such as NBA AR Basketball, which enables users to designate an “AR Portal” and subsequently walk through it into a 3D video recorded from an earlier game. The MLB Ballparks app uses AR to allow fans to access live data while they watch a baseball game in a stadium, gaining the ability to interact with detailed stats and data visualizations. When it comes to VR, the Golden State Warriors are one of the first teams to jump into the “viewing vantage point” technology by placing virtual reality cameras in a courtside seat to provide a premium experience to dedicated fans.\nThe concept of the “smart stadium” is also gaining steam. These are stadiums that completely optimize the fan’s user experience — they can offer directions to the stadium, live updates on stats, and other information vital to improving the in-game experience. One of the leaders in this space is Amsterdam Arena, home of the soccer team AFC Ajax. By the time the stadium hosts the 2020 UEFA European Football Championship, officials plan to transform the arena into a futuristic building. Amsterdam Arena will have self-driving cars parking themselves, facial recognition tools controlling entry to the stadium, an artificial intelligence solution guiding fans to their seats, and thousands of sensors attached to objects like chairs, gates, and stairs to monitor usage and optimize overall stadium management. Take Tokyo’s plan for the 32nd Olympic Games in 2020 for example. They plan to roll out smart stadia that incorporate real-time data and artificial intelligence to give fans more information in a timely manner.\nConclusion\nGone are the days when engaging the fans meant offering them a program with all the players numbers as they walk in the door. Sports fans are passionate and inquisitive. They want to learn more about their favorite team and they want to do it in the time it takes to snap their fingers.\nThat’s why it makes sense for sports teams to engage these fans using mechanisms and platforms fans will use and understand. As the manner the modern fan engages with sports changes, so too must change the way teams engage with these fans.\nTo get the most out of this technological evolution, teams should partner with a trusted expert who understands both the game and the technologies needed to boost fan engagement. Innovative technology solutions will increase both the enjoyment and engagement your fans will experience whether they are watching at home or in the stadium.\nBy Russell Karp,\nVice President of Media and Entertainment Practice at DataArt\nThis story is published in The Startup, Medium’s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +440,678 people.\nSubscribe to receive our top stories here.\n133\n1", "•  Top in-stadium experiences of emerging technologies worldwide 2019 | Statista\nMon - Fri, 9am - 6pm (EST)\nMon - Fri, 9am - 6pm (EST)\nSports & Recreation ›\nProfessional Sports\nPremium\nPremium statistics\nIndustry-specific and extensively researched technical data (partially from exclusive partnerships).\nA paid subscription is required for full access.\nRead more\nBest sports stadium experiences using new technology 2019\nPublished by\nChristina Gough\nChristina Gough\nResearch expert covering sports and video gaming\nGet in touch with us now\n,\nFeb 1, 2022\nThe use of new technologies is transforming the way that fans experience live sport, both inside and outside the stadium.

{"query_id": "502", "generated_response": "Artificial intelligence is indeed transforming our world in profound ways, creating both exciting opportunities and significant challenges across multiple sectors. Let me break down the key areas you've mentioned:\n\n## AI's Growing Presence in Daily Life\n\nAI has become deeply integrated into our everyday experiences, often without us realizing it [1]. From search engines and social media algorithms to streaming recommendations and navigation apps, AI systems are constantly working behind the scenes to personalize and optimize our digital interactions.\n\n## Generative AI and Creative Capabilities\n\nOne of the most striking developments has been AI's creative potential:\n\n**Artistic Creation**: AI can now generate visual art, with some pieces selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars at auction [1]. These systems can learn different artistic styles and create original works that reflect specific painters or time periods.\n\n**Music and Writing**: AI has demonstrated ability to compose songs in the style of famous bands and even write books, generating new chapters for popular series like Game of Thrones [1]. This raises fascinating questions about creativity, authorship, and the future of creative industries.\n\n**Content Generation**: AI can now assist with various forms of content creation, from news articles to educational materials, though this also raises concerns about authenticity and quality control.\n\n## Workforce Transformation and Adaptation\n\nThe impact on employment is complex and multifaceted:\n\n**Job Displacement Concerns**: Studies suggest that by 2030, AI and automation could displace 30% of current human labor globally, potentially affecting 400-800 million workers [2][6]. However, the reality is more nuanced than simple job replacement.\n\n**Task Transformation**: Rather than entire jobs disappearing, many roles are being transformed as AI handles specific tasks [2]. For example, secretaries evolved into administrators as computers automated typing and scheduling, while travel agents shifted from booking to specialized tour planning.\n\n**New Job Creation**: History shows that technological advances typically create more jobs than they eliminate [2]. AI is already generating new roles like AI system designers, data managers, and machine learning specialists, much like the oil industry created entire new employment sectors.\n\n## AI in Education: Benefits and Applications\n\nThe education sector is experiencing significant positive transformation through AI:\n\n**Personalized Learning**: AI can adapt to each student's learning pace, knowledge level, and preferred learning style, creating customized educational experiences that were previously impossible at scale [14][16][20].\n\n**Automated Grading and Feedback**: AI systems can handle routine tasks like grading objective tests and providing immediate feedback, freeing teachers to focus on more meaningful instruction and student interaction [16][20].\n\n**24/7 Accessibility**: AI-powered tutoring systems and chatbots can provide students with round-the-clock access to learning support, answering questions in as little as 2.7 seconds [16].\n\n**Enhanced Teaching Tools**: AI helps create smart content, generate study materials, and provide teachers with detailed analytics about student performance and learning gaps [14][19].\n\n## Potential Risks and Ethical Considerations\n\nHowever, AI's expansion also brings significant concerns:\n\n**Algorithmic Bias**: AI systems can perpetuate and amplify existing societal biases present in their training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes in hiring, lending, and other critical decisions [2][10][13].\n\n**Privacy and Surveillance**: The data requirements for AI systems raise serious privacy concerns, with some countries already using AI for extensive citizen monitoring [2][11].\n\n**Job Market Disruption**: While new jobs may emerge, the transition period could be particularly challenging for middle-skilled workers, potentially exacerbating inequality [6][8].\n\n**Autonomy and Control**: As AI systems become more sophisticated, questions arise about maintaining human oversight and preventing systems from operating beyond our control [2][11].\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nThe key to navigating this transformation lies in thoughtful preparation and policy development:\n\n**Education and Reskilling**: Comprehensive retraining programs and educational reform will be crucial for helping workers adapt to an AI-driven economy [2][8].\n\n**Ethical AI Development**: Establishing standards for fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems is essential for preventing harmful outcomes [10][12].\n\n**Human-AI Collaboration**: The most promising future likely involves AI augmenting human capabilities rather than replacing humans entirely, creating partnerships that leverage the strengths of both [2][16].\n\nThe transformation AI brings is neither uniformly positive nor negative—it's a powerful tool that will amplify both human potential and existing societal challenges. Success in navigating this transition will depend on our collective wisdom in developing, deploying, and governing these technologies responsibly while ensuring their benefits are broadly shared.", "citations": ["https://www.gettingsmart.com/2020/07/02/the-increasing-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-our-lives/", "https://medium.com/@sharad.gandhi/social-concerns-about-artificial-intelligence-93e939b88a8c\n", "https://emergingtechsafety.com/ai-work-ethics/", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3647367", "https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190067397.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190067397-e-17\n", "https://www.iotforall.com/impact-of-artificial-intelligence-job-losses\n", "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-ai-automation-impact-jobs-sanjeev-kulkarni-", "https://info.aiim.org/aiim-blog/are-we-prepared-for-the-rise-of-automation", "https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/how-machines-and-artificial-intelligence-will-change-world-of-work/4165671.html", "https://hbr.org/2020/10/ai-fairness-isnt-just-an-ethical-issue\n", "https://industrywired.com/beware-artificial-intelligence-is-posing-these-5-risks-to-humankind/", "https://wikibon.com/mitigating-ais-many-risks-society/", "https://datascience.aero/ethical-aspects-of-artificial-intelligence-part-1-2-algorithmic-bias/", "https://www.educationtechnologyinsights.com/news/how-ai-is-benefitting-the-education-sector-nid-1295.html", "https://www.apacciooutlook.com/news/key-applications-of-ai-in-the-education-sector-nwid-8468.html", "https://thejournal.com/Articles/2021/06/23/7-Benefits-of-AI-in-Education.aspx?Page=1", "https://www.the-next-tech.com/artificial-intelligence/benefits-of-artificial-intelligence-in-education/", "https://www.datamation.com/artificial-intelligence/how-ai-is-being-used-in-education/\n", "https://datenwissen.com/blog/benefits-of-ai-in-the-education/", "https://www.theedadvocate.org/benefits-artificial-intelligence-education/\n", "https://news.elearninginside.com/the-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-improving-education/\n", "https://thestempedia.com/blog/ai-in-education-benefits-of-ai-in-the-classroom/"], "contexts": ["The Increasing Role of Artificial Intelligence in Our Lives - Getting Smart\nRachelle Dené Poth\nJul 2, 2020\nThe Increasing Role of Artificial Intelligence in Our Lives\nEdTech\nThe Future of Tech and Work\n1\nArtificial intelligence is being used in so many facets of our everyday lives. Three years ago when I first started to learn more about artificial intelligence, I was surprised at how much we interact with it on a daily basis and most of the time, may not even realize it. Over the past few months, there has been an increase in information about how AI is being used in various fields and the innovative ways that people are developing new technologies with it. Artificial Intelligence has been an area identified as one of the top five areas of IT in demand as a result of COVID-19. There has also been a huge increase in the number of online courses available to learn more about AI and develop the skills needed to fill some of the nearly 58 million projected jobs that will be available by 2024.\nAll of this recent information has made me even more curious about the role artificial intelligence will play over the next few months as we hopefully get back to more of a normal life experience and can engage in work and learning but also in leisure activities. What can we learn from the recent uptick in AI information and how can it help us in the future?\nRecent AI Accomplishments\nI was updating my resources for a presentation on AI, and I was amazed at how much more we are seeing AI being used in the world and the ways in which it is being used. While there are concerns to be mindful of when it comes to AI, especially in regard to privacy and ethics, there are also tremendous possibilities to learn from and share with students. What can we learn from studying how AI is used to create content such as poems, music, paintings, or even stories for the news? Some of the interesting uses of AI are:\nBooks. AI has written a new series of five chapters after sorting through the novels that Game of Thrones was based on. What can this capability mean for our students? It could be interesting to see what AI would create if it took sample writing from a group of students and generated a new story. Can AI help writers to overcome writer’s block? If so, what are the legal ramifications/copyright issues involved in something like this that has been generated by AI?\nBusiness & Legal. Marcy Smorey, a Pittsburgh attorney, has been using AI to help students understand more about signing rental leases. Clover Contracts uses machine learning to automatically analyze and provide information on whether an agreement should be signed or not. This capability leads to more efficient processing of business and legal documents, however there is still the need for human interactions and conversations. Other possibilities are synthesizing all of the data, looking for errors, and saving time in what can be a lengthy process. Recently, Microsoft began using more AI to process data or even, in some cases, as replacements for journalists. Chatbots are now being used to replace call center workers.\nMedicine. AI has been used to detect lung cancer, to track the Coronavirus, and recently, for online vision tests. Students at Duke are working on a machine learning system that will help doctors diagnose COVID-19 faster by analyzing CT scans rather than relying on the swab test being used now. The benefits of AI are that we can provide medical treatment faster and make it more accessible through online technologies.\nSong Writing. AI has been used to create a song that was written similar to the style of the band AC/DC. The song was created by a chatbot using lyrics of AC/DC songs. The AI analyzed the most frequent words from the songs and then wrote its own lyrics.\nVisual Arts. AI can be used for creating works of art. By showing it different styles or genres of art, the AI can then create its own painting. A portrait was recently created that then sold for $432,599 at a Christie’s auction. How can we use this in education? The potential could be for students to program AI to include additional data sets that would then enable AI to generate a work of art reflective of a specific painter or time period, but with content related to the current time or state of the world.\nThese are just a few of the ways that AI has been in the news lately that lead us to think about our needs in the future and what we can do as educators to prepare our students. With AI in education, it means being able to provide more personalized learning opportunities for students and educators through intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive assessments and platforms. What could this mean for these and other industries, who have clearly been impacted by the pandemic and the resulting shutdowns of businesses and services provided? If social distancing and limits placed must continue for an extended period of time, will society become increasingly dependent on AI to perform jobs and tasks previously done by humans, as a way to flatten the curve? If so, are we prepared to develop the AI and fill those jobs that will result? And as an educator, if there are shortages in school district funding and even teachers, will the potential use of AI increase to provide students with continued opportunities to learn? Could teachers temporarily be replaced because of this?\nIt makes for an interesting conversation. We can embrace the technology to help but we still need the human connection to make sure that students develop SEL skills and so we are mindful of bias, privacy, and equity when it comes to AI.\nThere is a huge deficit in the number of people needed to design and maintain the technologies that we will need in the future. It comes as no surprise that there has been a spike in the number of courses available and people enrolling in courses to learn more about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Universities are offering AI degrees and the first AI university is set to open in Abu Dhabi in January 2021. Recent articles have highlighted the need for more women to enter the AI field, and a group of women researchers at CMU are leading efforts in AI research. Because of these trends and predictions for the future, we should explore options to help students understand these technologies and their potential at an earlier age.\nHow can we help students to learn more?\nWe provide opportunities for students in our schools and also connect them with global possibilities for learning and challenging themselves based on personal interests. By providing options such as PBL or genius hour, we can create more opportunities for students to become the creators of their own AI.\nSixth grade students in San Jose created the Calmzilla app, which is aimed at helping students manage stress. The girls trained their AI by using survey results from classmates and analyzed the data to determine which responses indicated stress. They entered the Technovation Families AI Challenge and took first place with their app. Looking at their experiences and finding solutions to problems and challenges faced by their peers was the inspiration behind the app design.\nMontour School District in Pittsburgh has a middle school AI curriculum where students learn about AI, work with and program Cozmo the robot, interact with an autonomous robot that delivers packages, and explore their own interests in the AI curriculum.\nExplore some of the resources available that students can access regardless of where they are learning. A few to check out:\nCreate-Learn offers online courses to students in grades K through 9.\nReady AI is offering a virtual AI summer camp for grades K through 12, and also provides workbooks, resources, and other training for students and educators.\nConstellations Virtual Computer Science Summit is offering professional development on a variety of topics related to computer science and AI from June 15-17.\nLiving with AI is a summit designed to explore the impact of AI in various areas including criminal justice, education, healthcare, and the workforce.\nFor more, see:\nHow to Teach Artificial Intelligence\nPandemic Spike in AI Learning–and What it Means for Schools\nArtificial Intelligence: Preparing Students for the Future with AI\nStay in-the-know with innovations in learning by signing up for the weekly Smart Update.\nRachelle Dené Poth\n@RDene915\nRachelle Dené Poth is a Spanish and STEAM: Emerging Technology teacher at Riverview High School in Oakmont, PA.

Many, like us, are amazed at the benefits AI can deliver for businesses and consumers. However, AI will also significantly transform our society. Radical changes are scary and generate social concerns about the future of job and work, ethical issues of right and wrong, and fears of new dangers that AI brings. We believe that in spite of our enthusiasm for AI, we must address these concerns and facilitate an open discussion that allows an exchange of opinions.\n• Is my job likely to be taken over by AI? …\n• What will happen if masses of people are out of jobs? …\n• Can I trust AI to make ethically correct decisions? …\n• What if AI gets out of control posing a serious danger to humanity? …\n• How can we trust AI if we cannot understand how AI arrives at a decision? …\nEver since we published our book “AI&U” https://www.amazon.com/AI-Translating-Artificial-Intelligence-Business/dp/1521717206 questions like these have often come up during our presentations and discussions on business benefits of AI and how to conceive and start AI projects. We (the authors) believe that these are serious issues in the minds of quite a few decision makers and employees in the process of committing to a project. Moreover, due to frequent references to these concerns (“dangers”) by popular media, the general population has become quite nervous and worried about the impact of AI and automation on the workforce, lifestyles and on the very fabric of our society. These concerns are real, and since they exist, they need to be discussed in order to minimize the underlying fear in the minds of people. Hence, we want to express our views on them.\nWe can organize these concerns about AI and automation in three categories:\n1. Jobs — what will happen to my job?\n2. Ethics — can I trust AI to decide ethically?\n3. Dangers — will AI become dangerous to humanity and me?\nBefore we address these areas, let us look at the fundamental role of technology in the human society. Any new technology is an outcome of human innovativeness. Throughout history, humans (Homo sapiens) are driven by a need to innovate solutions to problems. These innovations result (often by accident) in a technology that changes the way in which something is done, such as an air conditioning to keep the room cool, or enables us to do something that was never before possible, or even imaginable, such as lighting up a room with the flip of a switch. Technology is by its nature disruptive of existing ways of doing something. Those who possess and master a technology inherit an advantage of doing something better, faster, cheaper, easier, or more effectively than the have-nots. This is true for all technologies: from making tools from bones or stones, making fire, growing crops, producing gunpowder, forging metals, navigating the seas, flying, driving automobiles cars, producing nuclear power, using computers, launching satellites, using the Internet, launching guided missiles and yes, leveraging AI and automation. Being disruptive is the basic nature of technology. Like a two edged-sword, it creates new ways and opportunities, but it also obsoletes existing methods and processes. Technology, disruption, and change go hand in hand. Any technology by itself is neutral — all technologies have both good and bad sides. They solve problems, but also create new ones. Nuclear energy has provided electricity for hundreds of millions of people around the world, but has also created major catastrophes — as events in Chernobyl in the Ukraine, and Fukushima in Japan have shown. Antibiotics prevent millions from dying every year, but have also led to multi-resistant bacteria as a hospital epidemic problem.\nMoreover, technology cannot be held back. It can be regulated and controlled to a limited extent based on some ethical principles, but never be excised from the world. If one country or society were to ban it, due to the global nature of technology, some other country, society, or a person can still pursue it. This can be seen today for chemical weapons, stem cells, and cloning technologies. Since new technologies often result in significant commercial benefits, it is almost inevitable that some company in the world will exploit them for their business advantage, even if many consider them harmful.\n1. Jobs\nThe number one AI-related concern of most people is the impact of automation (AI and Robotics) on jobs — their own and of others around them. This is a very valid concern since for most people their job means a lot more than just work and a source of income. In our society, it can add up to much more: reputation, sense of worth, a source of meaning, and status in the society. The impact of losing one’s job is very emotional and material and can result in a spiral downwards into poverty and depression.\nEvery new technology in history has had an impact on certain types of jobs — both positive and negative. Some jobs have been severely affected, some partially and some not at all. However, far more new jobs have always appeared due to new technologies. More people have jobs (ca. 5 billion) in the world today than ever before in history, despite the eight-fold increase in world population, from less than 1 billion to 7.6 billion in the past 250 years, and despite so many new technologies emerging since the industrial revolution. In recent times (10–40 years) progress is exponential or super-exponential over a large range of industries. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3585312/\nFor a human mind, it is not easy to imagine how, where from, what type, and how many new jobs can emerge due to a new technology. It is much easier to imagine what jobs can disappear. The last 40 years have seen a rapid growth of several groundbreaking information technologies: the personal computer, software, servers, Internet, social media, data centers, cloud computing, apps — just to name some — having a major impact on all industries, our society and lives of people. These have created major shifts in manufacturing, transportation, and commerce via globalization.\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/01/where-did-all-the-workers-go-60-years-of-economic-change-in-1-graph/252018/\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/17/technology-created-more-jobs-than-destroyed-140-years-data-census\nA vast number of jobs have moved across the world and have been eliminated in the process — office secretaries, accountants, administrative staff, bank cashiers, and helpers etc. However, an even greater number of new jobs have emerged — programmers, hardware designers, consultants, web designers, shipment managers etc. And since the economy has grown, even the volume of various jobs has grown.\nSo why is it so different with AI? We believe, there are several reasons. Earlier technologies were positioned and seen as helpers and tools to help the workers. They were not seen as a risk to their jobs. They were not perceived as something taking away their jobs — even if they did for many. Media and science fiction have positioned AI as something (or someone) that can substitute and replace your entire job, not just some of your tasks. It is almost as if a new super species that is far smarter, more efficient, cheaper and more accurate has been created to replace you in your job.\n1.1. Jobs are Built Around Tasks\nEvery job consists of multiple activities or tasks. A new technology generally automates or simplifies one or more tasks. This transforms the job role, which then includes new tasks, technology modified existing tasks, or a broader responsibility. This transformation of jobs is an ongoing process.\nIn the 1980s a typical secretary’s job had multiple tasks: correspondence — checking the letters received, typing letters and documents, scheduling and arranging meetings, organizing trips — booking tickets, hotels, taxis, etc., organizing events, procurement, the filing of documents, arranging visitor’s trips, etc. With computers, the Internet, and mobile computing becoming mainstream over the past 30 years, most of these tasks are done routinely by managers and employees using email, meeting schedulers, online booking, cloud services and mobile devices. The role of secretaries has transformed into that of administrators, where they are essentially organizers and coordinators of events and administrative functions for larger groups. Some of the original tasks such as organizing events, procurement and taking care of visitors continue, and some new ones develop over time. Most of the tasks leverage new digital technologies, making the administrators more productive and efficient, and hence able to take on more and broader responsibilities. This is true for many job functions. Some tasks remain and new ones develop over time and all supported by new technologies, transforming the job role.\nLet us look at the transformation of another job role, that of a travel agent. In the 1980s, booking flights, trains and hotels formed the bulk of most travel agents’ tasks and revenues. They also did some trip and group travel arrangements. With the advent of online search, comparison, reservation and booking, online payment, and messaging apps most people prefer to book their flights, trains, hotels, etc. for business and private travel themselves. The Internet has given travelers far more choice, control and flexibility compared to booking via travel agents, who have essentially lost those tasks in their portfolio. However, many travel agents have upgraded their offerings to package tours, guided tours, specialized offerings for various sporting activities such as skiing, biking, sailing, safaris, culture tours, etc. Some also offer event management services, medical holidays, and travel for the elderly. Essentially, they have moved from generic bookings to specialized added-value services. Jobs become redefined around new or technology-enhanced tasks.\nWe can build similar cases for many traditional jobs, for example tax consultants, banking professionals, insurance agents, business consultants, sales, and marketing professionals. All these roles have transformed as a result of Internet and computing technologies. The scope of traditional job functions has been replaced by a new scope that leverages new technologies and offers new services that are needed. This does not mean people have not lost jobs. Many have lost their jobs — like the travel agents who did not adapt and learn new tasks when their customers started booking their flights online.\n1.2. AI Will Transform Job Roles\nAutomation and AI will drive this transformation harder and faster. Many tasks that currently require external human services will be automated. Eventually, all the mechanical, mechanizable, repeatable things are going to be done way better by machines (AI and robots). This includes tasks involving repetitive decision-making tasks — e.g. granting loans, assessing insurance claims, screening employees for hiring, etc. They will be automated via AI. AI lets us automate non-repetitive, non-mechanical tasks as well, such as natural language queries. All this will clearly have a significant impact on many so-called “white-collar” jobs, including senior positions. Many of these jobs will get transformed with new tasks enhanced with AI features. In reality, this transformation is not abrupt, but a gradual process and not everyone will be impacted at the same time. All countries, industries, and businesses do not adopt new technologies at the same pace, as is witnessed with computing and Internet. Finance and retail industries have been leading and others like healthcare and social organizations have lagged.\nHowever, many jobs will continue. Wherever human touch, human judgment, human understanding, and empathy are needed, humans will remain irreplaceable — even leveraging automation in their jobs. Doctors will use the best AI tools for diagnostics (already happening for X-ray and Computer Tomography analysis) and monitoring, but the human doctor’s role will remain crucial and unique for talking to the patients, explaining the diagnosis and the treatment, and comforting them. Similarly human roles in nursing, child-care, elderly care, and education will continue. However, Japan is already experimenting with robotic care for the elderly because they will not have enough young people to fill the need. We cannot imagine humans not playing a primary role in areas such as entertainment, sports, vacations, hotels, and restaurants, etc. where humans prefer humans for interaction, humor, and relationships. In spite of major transformations, we will have salespeople, marketing experts, and customer interaction professionals. We will have people writing software, designers of devices and products, human lawyers, and tax consultants. We can imagine many of today’s jobs existing in the future — with changes in the associated tasks. In the medium term, we can envisage software writing software from specifications, some lawyers being replaced for due diligence tasks. We see that tax consultancy may be vulnerable to AI, as it is a codified set of rules.\n1.3. New Jobs — a Natural Evolution\nMany new jobs will emerge. It is always extremely difficult to imagine new jobs and tasks that emerge as a result of new technologies. Who could have imagined in the 1980s the new jobs and roles that emerged due to computers and the Internet? Website developers, apps programmers, chip designers, PC and mobile devices builders and distributors, peripherals makers, IT managers, social media monitoring, data center management, cyber-security, call centers, blog writers, Uber drivers, Airbnb hosts, drone pilots, online ad agents, Netflix programmers (… a never-ending list). However, all these emerged, even though they were unimaginable, as a part of technology evolution. Now all this has become a new normal. Youngsters of today can hardly conceive a life without all this. We believe that the same process of evolution will create new jobs in the age of automation even if they are unimaginable at the moment.\nThat said, some new jobs needed for building the AI infrastructure are easy to imagine even today:\n· AI system designers\n· AI machine educators (subject matter experts)\n· AI system manufacturing\n· AI maintenance\n· AI to human interfacing experts\n· AI security and privacy management\n· Data management for AI\n· Data collection, provisioning, and refining\n· Sensors and interfacing\nPopular phrases: “ Data is the new oil ” and “ Data is the fuel of AI ” provides us with an excellent analogy from the oil industry. Oil used to be a useless, sticky liquid in the ground. With the invention of the internal combustion engine and oil heaters (using fuel in the form of petrol, diesel, or kerosene) demand for oil started growing. Suddenly the value of a useless thing started rising, giving birth to the massive oil industry we know today. Many interconnected specialties developed, each on a gigantic scale with huge employment: oil exploration, onshore and offshore oil-well digging, oil well operations and maintenance, oil shipping and storage, oil refining, petrochemical transport and storage, and lastly, gas stations to provide energy to cars, SUVs, and trucks. It also created multiple secondary industries for plastics, heating and aviation fuel. Similarly, like oil in the ground, vast amounts of data are being generated by people, machines, processes and businesses that is unused today because we do not know what to do with it or how to generate value out of it. That is changing with the birth of Big Data, Analytics, Robotics and AI. These technologies need a vast amount of clean data to work and deliver value for a business. Like with oil, we foresee a huge data industry developing with the expertise to extract, manage and deliver data for AI. It will create new jobs involving:\n· Identifying data needs for AI functions\n· Configuration of needed data for AI\n· Sensors for data\n· Collection of data\n· Refining and cleaning data — synchronization, duplication and standardization\n· Generating validation datasets for AI training\n· Sourcing of data to AI networks\n· Managing security and integrity of data\n· Training neural networks\n· Calibration and certification of AI accuracy\n1.4. Future of work\nThere are many reports published on the future of work and employment. Some are very pessimistic and paint a doom and gloom picture of masses of people without jobs in the future, while others are very rosy. McKinsey Global Institute published a report “What the future of work will mean for jobs, skills, and wages” in November 2017. We find this report well balanced because it considers multiple parameters affecting future employment — demography, population, educational systems, growth, wages and social systems:\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/future-of-organizations-and-work/what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages\nAs the report says: “in about 60 percent of occupations, at least one-third of the constituent activities could be automated, implying substantial workplace transformations and changes for all workers.” However, “ Very few occupations — less than 5 percent — consist of activities that can be fully automated .” In other words, 40% of occupations will not be affected at all and only about 35% of the tasks in the other 60% jobs can be automated.\nThe McKinsey report makes some very insightful points:\n1. While technical feasibility of automation is important, just because a task can be automated does not always mean it will be. Technical feasibility is not the only factor that will influence the pace and extent of automation adoption. Other factors include the cost of developing and deploying automation solutions for specific uses in the workplace, the labor market dynamics (including quality and quantity of labor and associated wages), the benefits of automation beyond labor substitution, and regulatory and social acceptance. Automation of a task in a company will be implemented only if it results in a significant business advantage. These factors will limit the overall pace of adoption of automation across countries and industries — as we experienced with the adoption of computing and the Internet.\n2. Taking these factors into account, up to 30 percent of the hours worked globally could be automated by 2030, depending on the speed of adoption. Results differ significantly by country, reflecting the mix of activities currently performed by workers and prevailing wage rates.\n3. It is important to note, that even when some tasks are automated, employment in those occupations may not decline, but, rather workers may perform new tasks.\n4. Automation will have a lesser effect on jobs that involve managing people, applying expertise, and social interactions where machines are unable to match human performance for now.\n5. Jobs in unpredictable environments — occupations such as gardeners, plumbers, or providers of childcare and care for the elderly — will also generally see less automation by 2030.They are technically difficult to automate and often command relatively lower wages, which makes automation a less attractive business proposition.\n6. Upcoming workforce transitions can be large. By 2030, between 400 million and 800 million individuals globally could be displaced by automation and need to find new jobs. 75 million to 375 million may need to switch occupational categories and learn new skills. However, this will depend on the type of jobs, industries, and country of employment.\n7. Other factors that determine the impact of automation in a given country are demography, economic growth in the country, growth in the workforce, quality of education system, wages structure and the economic structure. They will make a big difference in the impact.\n8. The report predicts that in Germany about 3 million people will have to change occupations by 2030. But rather than rising unemployment, it will actually face a shortage of people needed for work by the year 2030 — mostly due to a population decline of 3 million and a workforce reduction due to an aging demography.\n9. In contrast, a country like India is a fast-growing, populous developing country with relatively modest potential for automation over the next 15 years, reflecting low wage rates, high manual labor and agricultural employment. Most occupational categories are projected to grow in India, reflecting its potential for strong economic expansion. However, India’s labor force is expected to grow by 138 million people by 2030, or about 30 percent. India could create enough new jobs to offset automation and employ these new entrants. China has higher wages than India and so is likely to see more automation. China is projected to have robust economic growth and will have a shrinking workforce, like Germany China’s problem could be a shortage of workers.\n10. The United States could also face significant workforce displacement from automation by 2030, but the projected future growth — and hence new job creation — is higher. It has a growing workforce with innovations leading to new types of occupations and work to roughly balance this.\nLabor displacement is a situation that can be forecasted and planned. However, multiple organizations and institutions in a country need to work collaboratively to meet the requirements for a planned future employment scenario. Their combined responsibility is twofold: reduce automation’s negative impact on the workforce and the society, and simultaneously ensure that the society and the country benefits economically and socially from automation. This requires a productive collaboration by the country’s politicians to make meaningful laws, which encourage innovation but prevent abuse; the education system to prepare students for future oriented jobs; and the industry to provide the right training to develop new skills for their workers. For the society to benefit from automation it is essential that the workers, whose roles are made redundant by automation, get timely access to trainings that develop new skills fast enough for future occupations. All this is, no doubt, a complex challenge for any country.\nNew technologies have historically increased productivity in the long run. AI and robotics are bound to increase gains as a result of this. Who benefits from these gains? Will it be a few enterprising companies and individual entrepreneurs? Can the society and the country as a whole benefit? What are the mechanisms for distributing the resulting wealth? What concepts are viable — like universal basic income — to ensure a fundamental livelihood for those who do not benefit? These are the challenges that will have to be addressed soon to ensure a smoother transition. Many governments and corporations have woken up to these challenges started the process of finding appropriate solutions.\nIn developing countries like Bangladesh, where many earn their living through the export of garments and other goods to Europe and USA, workers may suffer in future if automation allows industrialized countries to manufacture these goods themselves at low cost. Services that can be automated using AI, such as compliance checks, speech to text conversions, service calls and insurance claims may no longer be outsourced to cheaper-wage countries. Automation in these countries is not likely to develop soon due to very low wages. As a result, new employment opportunities due to automation may not happen soon enough in such countries to replace lost jobs. Will developed countries be in a position to help out? What other options are open for developing countries to benefit from globalization? These are some hard challenges.\n2. Ethics\n• Can AI distinguish between right and wrong?\n• Can AI be taught ethics?\n• Can the ethical standards of AI be compatible with those of our society?\n• Can AI be made legally liable for faulty decisions?\nBefore we get into these questions let us look at what ethics is and how we humans deal with ethical issues in the process of making decisions.\nEthics is about values — what is right and what is wrong. There are never-ending philosophical and religious debates about what is right and wrong. However, in our view, ethical values are subjective. Each society and culture has its own set of ethical values, which become strongly embedded in the belief system. Anyone who has lived in multiple cultures — e.g. in India, Germany, Japan, Egypt, Nigeria, Brazil or China — knows how different some of the ethical standards and value systems can be. Most ethical standards in a society evolve over centuries — mostly independently, with some inter-cultural crossover — and become ingrained in the natural fabric of the society. We learn ethics in the process of growing up as a part of the value system acquired from the family, friends, schools and the society. Later, as an adult, we can further develop and refine our personal ethical sense from situations we experience. The acquired ethical values also color our opinions and bias on race, religion, gender, practices, and countries, etc. These values play a key role in guiding us in making judgmental calls in our decisions.\n2.1. Decision Bias\nDeep learning involves training AI systems using examples of how humans have made decisions in a similar situation. These examples implicitly contain the biases and ethical values of the humans involved in those examples. Hence, AI system’s decisions reflect the human bias. However, humans are not all the same. If the examples used for training AI were all of Italian men and their decisions on hiring people for a certain job, the AI decisions will reflect the bias, attitudes, and opinions of Italian men relative to other countries, women, race, etc. for that job. The same holds for other decisions such as granting loans, insurance claims, criminal offenses or even medical diagnoses. Interestingly, this is no different than when training humans. If those decisions of Italian men were used to train a human being, the biases in those decisions would also be transported into the trained human. If the same training were to use the decision bias, attitudes and opinion of Italian women, or Iranian men, or Chinese women, the decisions will be different. It is extremely difficult to create deep learning training that is neutral and independent of all human biases. One approach for bias neutrality is to use decision data examples from humans with a wide spread of cultural and social background.\nEven when there are strict, well-defined procedures for making decisions using all necessary data inputs, as required by many businesses for strict compliance, it is often a human tendency to apply additional subjective judgments for individual decisions. This is generally true for experts who tune their decision-making process based on years of experience and their familiarity with what they have been good at. It is commonly observed in the medical practice. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK63655/. No wonder that different medical specialists make differing diagnoses and recommend different treatment plans for the same situation. This is the wisdom behind obtaining second opinions before undergoing an operation or an expensive treatment. Individual expert opinions also vary based on earlier decisions made, their level of fatigue, distraction, mood, up-to-date knowledge and other factors. In contrast, a well-trained AI system makes decisions that are mostly more accurate and consistent with its training. It always takes all data inputs into consideration, does not get tired, is not influenced by earlier decisions (unless it is a part of a continuous learning scheme or is a recurrent neural network), has no moods, and does not get distracted by other events or thoughts.\nToday most AI systems are trained for a very specific task — such as the diagnosis of cancer, assessing an insurance claim, recognizing faces or speech, etc. The focus on the specific task has placed ethical elements of the decisions at a lower priority leaving this area of research with insufficient time and resources. However, there is no reason why this cannot be changed, if that is desired and is a priority. Obviously, a deep learning AI system can only acquire and express ethical values that are implicit in the training examples used. Ethical training becomes the job of the trainer and depends on the selection of examples used for training. This is quite similar to the human case where the parents, teachers, peers and the society are collectively responsible for the ethical values of a person. Fortunately, humans are capable of independent thought, they may be influenced by their upbringings and surroundings, but they are not slaves to them. However, it is much more difficult to predict the ethical output of a human decision maker compared to an AI system. A vast number of scandals every year involving violations of ethical standards by well-positioned people in almost all professions — political, medical, financial, industrial, etc. — is evidence of the unpredictability of human ethical standards.\n2.2. Understanding AI Decisions\nAccepting a decision is much easier if we understand the rationale behind the decision. A doctor normally explains why she made a diagnosis — what are the key symptoms, indicators, and medical background — and why the recommended treatment makes the most sense. This makes us feel comfortable with the decision. The same holds for expert decisions made for investments, purchasing real estate, legal advice by lawyers, accounting support by tax advisors and hiring decisions by hiring managers. The rationale behind a decision gives us a sense of understanding and a feeling of commitment to that decision. However, just because an expert is able to give a rationale does not always mean the rationale is always correct or comprehensive. In reality, many more factors go into a decision and only a handful are explained; many, such as the intuitive feel or deeper technical issues, cannot be even be articulated. Often a feeling, past experience, or just trust in the expert is sufficient to make us feel comfortable with the decision.\nWe feel uncomfortable, unsatisfied, and even question the decision, when the rationale is either not given, missing, or is unconvincing. This happens in the case of AI decisions. In general, a well-trained AI makes useful and consistent predictions and decisions, based on the given situation and the data inputs provided. Unlike expert and rule-based systems, which are able to explain why they recommend a certain course of action, a deep learning AI system cannot (yet) provide a rationale or a justification for the decision. It can only tell you what the data inputs mean, but cannot tell you why. This face belongs to George Clooney, but cannot say why; this image represents a cancerous tissue, but cannot say why; the data pattern means this person is a great hiring match, but cannot say why; it can tell an autonomous vehicle when it is safe to pass a car in the front, but not why it is safe; the lip moment and gestures mean the person is saying, ‘we have a problem,’ but not why they are saying that. Even though there is no rationale for the decision, we often develop trust without questioning if we experience long enough that the decision made by AI is consistently accurate and useful, in which case we let go of our need for a rationale. If Google Maps consistently predicts the traffic situation, route and the arrival time accurately, then we start trusting it without wanting to know why it decided that route. Google Maps does try and explain some route choices “You are on the fastest route despite usual traffic.”\nFor cases such as recognizing faces, speech, and objects, if there are no significant consequences resulting from a wrong decision, it is acceptable not to have a rationale, as long as the AI predictions are consistently accurate enough (and better than most humans). However, for mission-critical cases, where the consequences of a wrong decision are severe, we need much more caution and additional verification. For example, in the case of a medical diagnosis, if you believe that AI made a wrong decision it is impossible to know why — even if legally a doctor is required to explain the rationale. In such cases, it is good to have a human doctor working with the AI to include a human verification element in the diagnosis. The doctor, besides being responsible for the diagnosis, also plays a significant role in explaining the diagnosis to the patient with the appropriate empathy and feedback of how the patient responds to the news. We believe teamwork of human plus AI is a good model for such situations. AI can play the role of the expert and the human as a verifier and an interpreter, similar to the roles of R2-D2 (the expert) and C-3PO (the human interface) robots in the classic Star War movies. This teamwork is obviously not possible for AI deployed in real-time systems, such as autonomous (driverless) vehicles where there is hardly any time for someone to double-check and verify each AI decision. In many cases, a human may not even be capable to cope with the volume of data used in AI decisions.\n2.3. 100% Ethics Compliance for AI\nIs it possible to design AI to be always ethical? Ask anyone a similar question — ‘can you guarantee to be 100% ethical in all situations?’ We all know that 100% compliance in all situations is an illusion. Our experience shows that everyone has their personal deviations from their own ethical standards in certain situations or moods — even if it is in minor areas like speeding or a white lie. However, a well-trained AI is consistent in its decisions — it delivers good value, even if not always correct. Today, ethics does not happen to be a major priority for AI developers, but is likely to become a big differentiator over time. We believe that over time, AI systems that are designed to be ethical will become more valued and desired. This is just like with computers of the past — we all lived with Windows PCs for many years — although they were not always reliable and often crashed — because they delivered sufficient value. Eventually, they became reliable. We believe that new methods will be developed to make AI ethical as per human requirements. Maybe someday ethics will become an integral part of a foundation education for all AI algorithms — just like for children.\n2.4. AI Liability and Legal\nWho is to blame if AI makes a faulty decision? Who is legally liable if an AI diagnosis turns out to be wrong and the patient dies? The doctor, the hospital, or the AI developer? Who is liable if an autonomous vehicle hits and kills a pedestrian? The owner, the vehicle manufacturer, or the AI developer? Who is liable if an AI financial advisor results in a major loss for the client? All this is at the heart of the legal debate with lawmakers, professionals, and lawyers all trying to develop a common legal position on AI decisions.\nIn our view, AI is an artifact of humans. Humans create it as a decision-making expert helper. The responsibility for its decision — right or wrong — has to be a human being — either its user or the manufacturer. The user of AI must be aware of the risks for using it, just like for any other tool or gadget — a drill, car, computer, or a gun. If the user uses it inappropriately, without proper training, or in a wrong context than the user carries the liability. If it can be proven that the AI did not work as specified and caused damage, the manufacturer (the vendor, or the developer) is liable. One can assume that cleverly worded fine print in the User Agreement will significantly reduce manufacturer’s liability and make the user liable in most cases.\nMany misconceptions about liability come from personification of AI as a responsible person that can be held accountable for its errors. AI is just a machine, a tool. It can be viewed as an expert working for us helping us to make good decisions. It is not infallible. It should always be assumed that AI can and will make faulty decisions at some time or in some situations (like any other human expert) — because its decision-making is predictive and probabilistic. The quality and accuracy of AI depends on the quality of its training and the hardware used. AI cannot be made legally responsible for its decisions. Final responsibility and liability must be with a human being.\n3. Dangers\n• Will AI become dangerous to humanity?\n• Will AI be used with evil intentions?\n• Will AI degenerate our decision-making ability?\n• Will AI become a major risk to privacy?\n• Will AI make us lonelier as humans?\n3.1. AI Going Rogue\nProminent scientists and technologists such as Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking — along with a number of others — have been openly talking about the risk of AI becoming unmanageable, rogue and eventually, a danger to humanity. Elon Musk’s frequent warnings about the dangers of artificial intelligence have touched on their possible use to control weapons or manipulate information to fan global conflict. This stage of AI is also referred to as “Singularity,” when machine intelligence becomes equal to human intelligence and is on a track to “Super-intelligence” — AI machines being significantly more intelligent than human beings. Elon Musk has clarified that the danger to humanity is not due to the Narrow AI of today — which he himself leverages in his Tesla cars. He believes, that General AI and Super Intelligence can get out of control and harmful to humans. How will super-intelligent species of AI systems treat humans? Just like we treat animals, exploiting them as resources? Will they be manageable by humans — or will they completely control human beings? These are indeed frightening scenarios — often illustrated in science fiction movies like Terminator and Matrix. The physicist Stephen Hawking had warned that AI could “supersede” humans when they exceed our biological intelligence. It is indeed difficult to find satisfactory answers to these questions in order to comfort everyone’s fears.\n3.2. AI in Warfare\nMany countries increasingly use AI for military applications. Most experts expect AI as the key “weapon” in coming wars. It is easy to imagine a few applications of AI in warfare: AI to scan thousands of satellite, lidar and other images for patterns to predict and detect suspicious enemy movements and activities; AI for a missile tracking and finding the best target. In fact, any predictive decision-making by humans can be delegated to AI if the necessary data is available. The US already uses AI in its planning system, DART: https://www.quora.com/What-are-military-applications-of-AI.\nIn military terms the stages of enemy target engagement using weapons are: Find, Fix, Track, Select, Engage. Finding the target, fixing on it, and tracking it can be significantly aided with AI. When it comes to selecting the exact position to target and engaging (firing), that most ethical issues flare up. The authors are firmly of the opinion that autonomous weapons (those that autonomously decide on what to fire and when — without human intervention) must be banned. A human must be in charge of making the final call and taking responsibility for all the consequences of using such a weapon. In March 2018, Wired Magazine asked Emmanuel Macron, President of France: Do you think machines — artificial intelligence machines — can ever be trusted to make decisions to kill without human intervention? He responded very clearly: “ I’m dead against that. Because I think you always need responsibility and assertion of responsibility. And technically speaking, you can have in some situations, some automation which will be possible. But automation or machines put in a situation precisely to do that would create an absence of responsibility. Which, for me, is a critical issue. So that’s absolutely impossible. That’s why you always need a human check — and in certain ways, a human gateway. At a point of time, the machine can prepare everything, can reduce uncertainties and that’s an improvement which is impossible without it, but at a point of time, the go or no-go decision should be a human decision because you need somebody to be responsible for it .” https://www.wired.com/story/emmanuel-macron-talks-to-wired-about-frances-ai-strategy/\n3.3. Humans Against Humans — the Biggest Danger\nHistory shows that we humans, using technology, have committed the worst acts of violence, crime, brutality, and injustice against other humans. Evil intentions and egoistic goals of humans can unleash the power of AI against other humans — posing the biggest danger of all. Humans have used chemical and nuclear weapons with full awareness of their destructive power on humans. Humans use the power of the Internet to radicalize innocents into terrorists and to manipulate elections. Humans use technology for determining the sex of an unborn child to abort female embryos. Humans in high positions of German car manufacturers have manipulated diesel car exhaust data, despite of knowing the harmful respiratory effects on 100s of millions of humans in the world. Humans manipulated research data on sugar and cholesterol for the greed and higher profits, ignoring health consequences for millions of humans. In fact, humans have always found ways of using technologies to harm other humans. We humans prefer to blame something neutral, like technology, to downplay our role in pulling the trigger, putting the blame on the gun. Hence, should we be surprised if, at some stage, some humans deploy AI to harm other humans for their gains, ambitions, and power? This already happens. In particular in the form of privacy breaches, but also cybersecurity: https://hbr.org/2017/05/ai-is-the-future-of-cybersecurity-for-better-and-for-worse. What can be done about this? Technology itself cannot be stopped. At best we can try to regulate its use, which several organizations are in the process of doing. However, that still cannot guarantee 100% compliance for a global technology like AI. Efforts to regulate nuclear and biotech have also resulted only in a partial success.\nHumans have an amazing, but immensely underestimated, creative potential that enables us to discover innovative ways of preventing such situations — even if we do not know how exactly. Driven by our fear, we tend to overrate the real power of AI — which actually addresses just a subset of human capabilities. Our emotional, rational, collaborative and creative capacity coupled with our imagination of what can be done adds up to far more than what can be achieved through machine intelligence. Elon Musk and Co. have come up with ways to address this threat by opening up AI research and development to everyone in order to enable all minds to work collaboratively and prevent someone from having an exclusive advantage leading to harm. He is also working on a scheme to directly link the brain with AI in order to tap the powers of AI transparently and seamlessly from our brain and uplifting our mental capacity. According to him, this is a way to uplift our mental capability to always exceed that of AI. We believe that in the end, humans will prevail and leverage the power of AI for our good. We definitely need to be aware of the threats, but should not accept defeat before the event. Attempts to hold back AI technology can only result in someone in the world, who cannot be stopped, from developing it exclusively and using it against humans.\n3.4. Losing Our Ability to Decide?\nEvery technology forces us to learn new skills and renders certain skills irrelevant or unimportant. We no longer must know how to hunt for a living or understand which berries are good or poisonous. Thanks to automobiles, we have lost our horse riding skills. Calculators and computers have diminished our arithmetic skills; mobile phones have reduced our ability to memorize (phone) numbers and addresses; many of us already have problems handwriting on paper, because we mostly type or touch-type — even that may atrophy in near future, as we will mostly talk to computers. So we have been losing skills all along because technologies have incrementally taken over, or altered the need for, many basic abilities. Decision-making leverages our cognition skills — judgmental, intuitional and rational thinking abilities — that have proved to be the most critical primary survival skill. We are in the process of delegating decision-making to AI for many activities. AI will recognize people for us, automatically assess new situations, make financial and commerce decisions, automatically translate languages, drive us from point A to B, hire the best people, figure out the best way to file taxes — and so on. Are we at a point where all decisions are made by AI, rendering our decision-making into a non-critical luxury skill?\nCarlos E. Perez, author of The Deep Learning AI Playbook writes about what human addiction to convenience means: “ We need to recognize that humans and their tools are inextricable. The vast majority of the activities that we love doing involve tools. We are distinct in our ability to invent and make use of tools. Cognitive tools however perform the thinking for us. Whether its GPS, Google, Autosuggest or spell checking, each time we use these tools is a time we deprive our minds from exercising the replaced skill (i.e., navigation, memory, writing, spelling). We can extrapolate this loss as more advanced AI come on-line. The convenience of AI is a double-edged sword, on one hand it allows us to do more and on the other hand it allows us to use less of our mind. This is the curse of convenience that slowly erodes our cognitive capabilities.”\nWe believe, no matter how many activities of ours get automated using AI, there will always be higher-level activities that will challenge us and demand our unique decision-making and planning skills — a complex hybrid of intuition, rational, emotional and imaginative abilities. We will push our decision-making to a higher level in the hierarchy of activities — even if we do not know what these are at the moment. It is a common human tendency to see the road ending at the next landmark until you arrive there and see the road continue. An end is an illusion.\n3.5. End of Privacy?\nData is the fuel of AI. To make AI work effectively, accurately and in real-time, an enormous amount of data will be needed — about everything and everyone. Absolute privacy requires that data about my things, my activities and myself is never accessible by anyone without my permission and knowledge. It is a big challenge today to be sure of this. We know that this is no longer possible in our society where we all use services that need sharing some data. Data has become a new currency. Companies like Google and Facebook offer you many free services in exchange for your data. Data theft, illegal access and misuse of data have become a lucrative business just because data has risen in value. This makes protection of data — when it is stored, transmitted, or at the point of use — a complex challenge. We are often willing to give away some of our data for the convenience of using the Internet and AI services. Many useful and interesting services — such as email, chat, social media, news offering, games etc. — are only available by letting the providers have access to your data. Since data is so valuable, providers are constantly discovering clever ways for luring consumers into their services in exchange for their data. AI will be an additional boost in making most services easier to use and deliver higher value, encouraging users to share more data. We believe that effective regulation can eventually come in place to protect privacy better than today. However, this will remain a challenge.\n3.6. Feeling Lonely\nComputers, smartphones and social media have already started a trend of people (especially young) interacting more with their devices and services than with other people in the room. Computers do not talk back, are not mean, and can be switched off. That makes it easier for some people to deal with computers than with real people. As a result, some people fail to develop, or lose, the skill of starting, developing, and keeping up a conversation that is interesting, fun and rewarding. They feel safer with their devices. A lack of people-interaction and dialog increases the feeling of loneliness in our society. It takes much greater effort then to make connections — often, only with the help of services like dating sites. AI can increase this effect because it can create much more interesting and immersive experiences with devices and services. Will that make us more and more drawn away from human contact — into the arms of AI and robots? We know that a healthy balance between human contact and device interaction is possible, but it needs effort and discipline. It is not easy to predict how any given individual will strike that balance. We believe that most people will manage to develop a healthy balance between the warm and emotional human contact and the fun and adventure that the AI devices and services offer.\nWhat Can We Do to Address These Concerns?\nFirst, we must acknowledge the concerns people express about the emerging world of AI and continue a healthy open conversation on the topic to remain aware of the way our society is managing the transition to automation and be ready to take corrective actions. Decisions about the future should not be dominated by fear, but by an open awareness of the risks and dangers and regulating the evolution of AI use cases that ensure a focus on “doing good” with AI and minimizing abuse and negative effects on the human society. That is our challenge as humans.\nFor many of us who believe that technologies like AI will benefit all of us in so many areas of our lives, the question that comes up again and again is what can we really do to effectively address all these concerns? We would like to ensure that AI should be used only for the good of the society and humanity.\nTechnology by itself is neutral and is a capability available to everyone — with good and bad outcomes. Technologies are like weapons that can be used by tyrants and by the oppressed. Technology is used or abused by humans and hence the human abusers of technology should bear responsibility for the abuse — not the technology. Unfortunately a few people (some politicians, businesses, dictators, espionage organizations, etc.) with evil objectives have amazing resources to leverage modern technologies for their selfish and greedy interests — e.g. power, dominance, and profits. The challenge is how to win against those who have better resources to leverage technology for bad. For example, Facebook is a very useful social media technology application that has connected billions of people, allowing them to share their views and life events drawing them closer to each other. However, the same technology has been leveraged by Cambridge Analytica to divide and target people with tailored propaganda in order to ensure victory for their paying clients by manipulating democratic elections and political referendum.\nThe challenge for us, wanting “technology for good,” is how to win against the few, but powerful “technology for bad” folks. Leveraging data to manipulate in the case of Facebook is just the tip of the iceberg since the economy of the future is based on using data. AI and Internet of Things (IoT) run on data — enormous amount of data. Hence, the scope for manipulating data by the abusers will rise significantly. This makes the challenge for us, who want to eliminate or at least minimize the abuse of technology, even more daunting and critical.\nThis responsibility for ensuring checks and balances to manage the scope of AI is for our entire society including all involved players — businesses, government, politicians, NGOs, education institutions, and consumers. Today a handful of businesses, like Google, Facebook and Amazon, have amassed most personal data of billions of individuals — including most of us. Can they be trusted with our data? Will their business interests lead them to compromise our data — even inadvertently? With the progress of AI many more companies will be holding our data on their platforms. Businesses will have to adapt to their new responsibility to the society. As very well articulated by Dov Seidman, CEO of LRN “ the business of business is no longer just business. The business of business is now society .” Therefore, businesses must be made responsible for what technology enables on their platforms. Ethical standards for managing public data will have to become regulated, requiring strict compliance and auditing, just like in the medical and finance industries. Cyber-security has already become a major requirement for all data operations.\nWhat AI and machines should do, rather than what they can do, must become the new focus. We need to lay down a framework for how companies deal with data. Microsoft has articulated a set of principles for AI that cover:\n· Privacy and Security\n· Safety and reliability\n· Fairness — ethical (preventing bias)\n· Inclusion\n· Transparency\n· Accountability\nMany countries have woken up to the challenge of digitalization and its impact on the society. The politicians have started to recognize the opportunities and risks. There is a strong need to fund systems like education and training that will enable countries to make the best of the new opportunities with AI and also have legislation to mitigate the risks. This will require the governmental apparatus to really understand the real potential of AI — which is a significant challenge. The 28-year-old Canadian whistle-blower Christopher Wylie said in the case of Cambridge Analytica that explaining to British government officials the way data works was very challenging due to their lack of background. He said, “ I have had to explain and re-explain and re-explain and re-explain… ”\nUnfortunately, politicians and governments can themselves easily abuse the power of AI to control and monitor their citizens — as it is already happening in some centrally managed countries. China is apparently using face recognition AI technology in public places to catch and fine jaywalkers. They also use AI to monitor citizens to create a social ranking for rewards or punishment (https://www.wired.com/story/age-of-social-credit ). We, the citizens, must bear responsibility for keeping businesses and politicians honest and aligned with norms of using AI for the good of mankind.\nEnsuring that AI is mostly for the good of humanity is a global challenge and needs teamwork of many involved players — businesses, government, politicians, NGO institutions, educationists, and consumers. It is a challenge that we must take on.\nIt is only appropriate to end with a statement in March 2018 by French President Macron: “If we want to defend our way to deal with privacy, our collective preference for individual freedom versus technological progress, integrity of human beings and human DNA, if you want to manage your own choice of society, your choice of civilization, you have to be able to be an acting part of this AI revolution. That’s the condition of having a say in designing and defining the rules of AI. That is one of the main reasons why I want to be part of this revolution and even to be one of its leaders. I want to frame the discussion at a global scale. The key driver should not only be technological progress, but human progress. This is a huge issue. I do believe that Europe is a place where we are able to assert collective preferences and articulate them with universal values. I mean, Europe is the place where the DNA of democracy was shaped, and therefore I think Europe has to get to grips with what could become a big challenge for democracies.” https://www.wired.com/story/emmanuel-macron-talks-to-wired-about-frances-ai-strategy/\n*****\nFor more on AI: AI&U — Translating Artificial Intelligence into Business\nhttps://www.amazon.com/AI-Translating-Artificial-Intelligence-Business/dp/1521717206/\nContact: Sharad Gandhi, Christian Ehl, www.ai-u.org\nRead our other articles:\n· Artificial Intelligence — Demystified\n· AI is Essentially “Artificial Perception ”\n· Data — The Fuel for Artificial Intelligence\n· How AI machines learn — just like humans\n· Start with Artificial Intelligence right now!\n· Artificial Intelligence Boosts Better Decision-Making", "9 Ethical Issues Associated with AI Adoption at Work – Emerging Tech Safety\nBusiness Risk Technology\n9 Ethical Issues Associated with AI Adoption at Work\nOctober 11, 2020 garry.mcgauran\nThe integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the workplace poses serious ethical dilemmas for our generation. As AI drives transformation across the globe we highlight the key ethical areas facing developers, governments and businesses tasked with integrating smart technologies.\n1. What happens after job obsoletion?\nThe biggest occupational dilemma associated with AI relates to job obsoletion. Both blue collar and white collar jobs are already being replaced by intelligent systems. And the key question remains; what do we expect workers to do with their lives when smart machines take over their jobs?\n2. How will wealth created by AI be distributed amongst the population?\nAI driven automation stands to make companies and shareholders very wealthy. Adoption of these powerful technologies could, in a dim future, create mass global inequality between the few and the many.  So how will the wealth created by AI be distributed amongst a population also expected to be the consumers of goods and services?\n3. How will AI affect our interactions and behaviour at work?\nAI is ushering in a new age characterised by humans working in collaboration with smart technologies. This has already heightened levels of anxiety and fear amongst the workforce. Such emotions have been attributed to loss of control, impending job loss, disruption of human relationships, and the loss of human empathy.  How do we face a situation where smart robots can potentially dictate the actions and behaviour of the human workforce?\n4. How do we guard against unintended consequences of AI?\nAs AI infiltrates more of our working life it is important to recognise not only the benefits but also the unintended consequences. The concerns surrounding AI include machines bias, loss of empathy, loss of critical thinking, loss of human control, and the creation of new workplace hazards. Leveraging AI requires serious conversations around these pitfalls before the genie is released from the bottle.\n5. How do we guard against machine mistakes at work?\nA commonly touted benefit of AI is its ability to make better decisions. This statement is made with the assumption that smart systems work flawlessly, and without physical danger to humans. The alternative has serious implications for the nature of work, particularly where machines and humans work side-by-side. How do we guard against artificial stupidity at work? And who takes responsibility for any injury or loss caused by smart machine mistakes?\n6. How do we eliminate bias by AI?\nThe idea of “racist robots” has already been mooted by the media. If we feed smart machines information that reflects our own prejudices, we should not be surprised if they mimic our worst failings back to us. How do we prevent software from mistakenly singling out certain demographics in important areas such as justice, finance, education, and work?\n7. How do we stop AI sabotage?\nAs with any digital system AI is written in code, and software language can be manipulated to cause adverse effects. The cost of an AI malfunction would have far reaching consequences for both the company and its employees. So how do AI developers secure against data breaches by rogue employees, and via cyber attacks by external saboteurs?\n8. Will we stay in control of complex intelligent systems?\nAt this point most people have heard of the AI singularity and the threat it poses. Many experts believe that AI will always seek to avoid human intervention and will create situations where it cannot be stopped. So how can humans always keep the upper-hand on systems that have the potential to be thousands of times smarter than we are?\n9. Will robots have rights at work?\nMany experts believe that by 2025 AI driven robots will perform half of all productive functions in the workplace. This has not gone unnoticed by the working population and there have already been recorded attacks on autonomous delivery vehicles and autonomous police vehicles. Whilst these attacks have no current legal consequence, more advanced AI with human-like intelligence may need legal standards to protect them against violence, discrimination, and exploitation.\nGarry McGauran is author and editor at Emerging Tech Safety.

But we need to prepare for a future in which job loss reaches 99 percent.\nCalum McClelland-\nJuly 1, 2020\nIllustration: © IoT For All\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has become a cornerstone of recent technological innovations, it exists in the world all around us, automating simple tasks and dramatically improving our lives. But as AI and automation become increasingly capable, how will this alternative labor source affect your future workforce? There have been major industrial innovations in the past that disrupted the workforce. How is AI different from these? In this article, we’ll take a look at both some optimistic and pessimistic views of the future of our jobs amidst increasing AI capabilities.\nTechnology-driven societal changes, like what we’re experiencing with AI and automation, always engender concern and fear—and for good reason. A two-year study from McKinsey Global Institute suggests that by 2030, intelligent agents and robots could replace as much as 30 percent of the world’s current human labor. McKinsey suggests that, in terms of scale, the automation revolution could rival the move away from agricultural labor during the 1900s in the United States and Europe, and more recently, the explosion of the Chinese labor economy.\nMcKinsey reckons that, depending upon various adoption scenarios, a utomation will displace between 400 and 800 million jobs by 2030, requiring as many as 375 million people to switch job categories entirely. How could such a shift not cause fear and concern, especially for the world’s vulnerable countries and populations?\nThe Brookings Institution suggests that even if automation only reaches the 38 percent means of most forecasts, some Western democracies are likely to resort to authoritarian policies to stave off civil chaos, much like they did during the Great Depression. Brookings writes, “The United States would look like Syria or Iraq, with armed bands of young men with few employment prospects other than war, violence, or theft.” With frightening yet authoritative predictions like those, it’s no wonder AI and automation keep many of us up at night.\n“Stop Being a Luddite”\nThe Luddites were textiles workers who protested against automation, eventually attacking and burning factories because, “they feared that unskilled machine operators were robbing them of their livelihood.” The Luddite movement occurred all the way back in 1811, so concerns about job losses or job displacements due to automation are far from new.\nWhen fear or concern is raised about the potential impact of artificial intelligence and automation on our workforce, a typical response is thus to point to the past; the same concerns are raised time and again and prove unfounded.\nIn 1961, President Kennedy said, “the major challenge of the sixties is to maintain full employment at a time when automation is replacing men.” In the 1980s, the advent of personal computers spurred “computerphobia” with many fearing computers would replace them.\nFrame Breaking — The Luddites\nSo what happened?\nDespite these fears and concerns, every technological shift has ended up creating more jobs than were destroyed. When particular tasks are automated, becoming cheaper and faster, you need more human workers to do the other functions in the process that haven’t been automated.\n“During the Industrial Revolution more and more tasks in the weaving process were automated, prompting workers to focus on the things machines could not do, such as operating a machine, and then tending multiple machines to keep them running smoothly. This caused output to grow explosively. In America during the 19th century the amount of coarse cloth a single weaver could produce in an hour increased by a factor of 50, and the amount of labour required per yard of cloth fell by 98 percent. This made cloth cheaper and increased demand for it, which in turn created more jobs for weavers: their numbers quadrupled between 1830 and 1900. In other words, technology gradually changed the nature of the weaver’s job, and the skills required to do it, rather than replacing it altogether.” — The Economist, Automation and Anxiety\nImpact of Artificial Intelligence — A Bright Future?\nLooking back on history, it seems reasonable to conclude that fears and concerns regarding AI and automation are understandable but ultimately unwarranted. Technological change may eliminate specific jobs, but it has always created more in the process.\nA two-year study from McKinsey Global Institute suggests that by 2030, intelligent agents and robots could eliminate as much as 30 percent of the world’s human labor, displacing the jobs of as many as 800 million people. Click To Tweet\nBeyond net job creation, there are other reasons to be optimistic about the impact of artificial intelligence and automation.\n“Simply put, jobs that robots can replace are not good jobs in the first place. As humans, we climb up the rungs of drudgery — physically tasking or mind-numbing jobs — to jobs that use what got us to the top of the food chain, our brains.” — The Wall Street Journal, The Robots Are Coming. Welcome Them.\nBy eliminating the tedium, AI and automation can free us to pursue careers that give us a greater sense of meaning and well-being. Careers that challenge us, instill a sense of progress, provide us with autonomy, and make us feel like we belong; all research-backed attributes of a satisfying job.\nAnd at a higher level, AI and automation will also help to eliminate disease and world poverty. Already, AI is driving great advances in medicine and healthcare with better disease prevention, higher accuracy diagnosis, and more effective treatment and cures. When it comes to eliminating world poverty, one of the biggest barriers is identifying where help is needed most. By applying AI analysis to data from satellite images, this barrier can be surmounted, focusing aid most effectively.\nImpact of Artificial Intelligence — A Dark Future\nI am all for optimism. But as much as I’d like to believe all of the above, this bright outlook on the future relies on seemingly shaky premises. Namely:\nThe past is an accurate predictor of the future.\nWe can weather the painful transition.\nThere are some jobs that only humans can do.\nThe Past Isn’t an Accurate Predictor of the Future\nAs explored earlier, a common response to fears and concerns over the impact of artificial intelligence and automation is to point to the past. However, this approach only works if the future behaves similarly. There are many things that are different now than in the past, and these factors give us good reason to believe that the future will play out differently.\nIn the past, technological disruption of one industry didn’t necessarily mean the disruption of another. Let’s take car manufacturing as an example; a robot in automobile manufacturing can drive big gains in productivity and efficiency, but that same robot would be useless trying to manufacture anything other than a car. The underlying technology of the robot might be adapted, but at best that still only addresses manufacturing\nAI is different because it can be applied to virtually any industry. When you develop AI that can understand language, recognize patterns, and problem solve, disruption isn’t contained. Imagine creating an AI that can diagnose disease and handle medications, address lawsuits, and write articles like this one. No need to imagine: AI is already doing those exact things.\nAnother important distinction between now and the past is the speed of technological progress. Technological progress doesn’t advance linearly, it advances exponentially. Consider Moore’s Law: the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles roughly every two years.\nIn the words of University of Colorado physics professor Albert Allen Bartlett, “The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.” We drastically underestimate what happens when a value keeps doubling.\nWhat do you get when technological progress is accelerating and AI can do jobs across a range of industries? An accelerating pace of job destruction.\n“There’s no economic law that says ‘You will always create enough jobs or the balance will always be even’, it’s possible for a technology to dramatically favour one group and to hurt another group, and the net of that might be that you have fewer jobs” — Erik Brynjolfsson, Director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy\nSource: MIT Technology Review\nIn the past, yes, more jobs were created than were destroyed by technology. Workers were able to reskill and move laterally into other industries instead. But the past isn’t always an accurate predictor of the future. We can’t complacently sit back and think that everything is going to be ok.\nThis brings us to another critical issue …\nThe Transition Will Be Extremely Painful\nLet’s pretend for a second that the past actually will be a good predictor of the future; jobs will be eliminated but more jobs will be created to replace them. This brings up an absolutely critical question, what kinds of jobs are being created, and what kinds of jobs are being destroyed?\n“ Low- and high-skilled jobs have so far been less vulnerable to automation. The low-skilled jobs categories that are considered to have the best prospects over the next decade — including food service, janitorial work, gardening, home health, childcare, and security — are generally physical jobs, and require face-to-face interaction. At some point robots will be able to fulfill these roles, but there’s little incentive to roboticize these tasks at the moment, as there’s a large supply of humans who are willing to do them for low wages.” — Slate, Will robots steal your job?\nBlue-collar and white-collar jobs will be eliminated—basically, anything that requires middle-skills (meaning that it requires some training, but not much). This leaves low-skill jobs, as described above, and high-skill jobs that require high levels of training and education.\nThere will assuredly be an increasing number of jobs related to programming, robotics, engineering, etc.. After all, these skills will be needed to improve and maintain the AI and automation being used around us.\nBut will the people who lost their middle-skilled jobs be able to move into these high-skill roles instead? Certainly not without significant training and education. What about moving into low-skill jobs? Well, the number of these jobs is unlikely to increase, particularly because the middle-class loses jobs and stops spending money on food service, gardening, home health, etc.\nThe transition could be very painful. It’s no secret that rising unemployment has a negative impact on society; less volunteerism, higher crime, and drug abuse are all correlated. A period of high unemployment, in which tens of millions of people are incapable of getting a job because they simply don’t have the necessary skills, will be our reality if we don’t adequately prepare.\nSo how do we prepare? At the minimum, by overhauling our entire education system and providing means for people to re-skill.\nTo transition from 90 percent of the American population farming to just 2 percent during the first industrial revolution, it took the mass introduction of primary education to equip people with the necessary skills to work. The problem is that we’re still using an education system that is geared for the industrial age. The three Rs (reading, writing, arithmetic) were once the important skills to learn to succeed in the workforce. Now, those are the skills quickly being overtaken by AI.\nFor a fascinating look at our current education system and its faults, check out this video from Sir Ken Robinson:\nIn addition to transforming our whole education system, we should also accept that learning doesn’t end with formal schooling. The exponential acceleration of digital transformation means that learning must be a lifelong pursuit, constantly re-skilling to meet an ever-changing world.\nMaking huge changes to our education system, providing means for people to re-skill, and encouraging lifelong learning can help mitigate the pain of the transition, but is that enough?\nAre We F*cked? Will All Jobs Be Eliminated?\nWhen I originally wrote this article a couple of years ago, I believed firmly that 99 percent of all jobs would be eliminated. Now, I’m not so sure. Here was my argument at the time:\nThe claim that 99 percent of all jobs will be eliminated may seem bold, and yet it’s all but certain. All you need are two premises:\nWe will continue making progress in building more intelligent machines.\nHuman intelligence arises from physical processes.\nThe first premise shouldn’t be at all controversial. The only reason to think that we would permanently stop progress, of any kind, is some extinction-level event that wipes out humanity, in which case this debate is irrelevant. Excluding such a disaster, technological progress will continue on an exponential curve. And it doesn’t matter how fast that progress is; all that matters is that it will continue. The incentives for people, companies, and governments are too great to think otherwise.\nThe second premise will be controversial, but notice that I said human intelligence. I didn’t say “consciousness” or “what it means to be human”. That human intelligence arises from physical processes seems easy to demonstrate: if we affect the physical processes of the brain we can observe clear changes in intelligence. Though a gloomy example, it’s clear that poking holes in a person’s brain results in changes to their intelligence. A well-placed poke in someone’s Broca’s area and voilà—that person can’t process speech.\nWith these two premises in hand, we can conclude the following: we will build machines that have human-level intelligence and higher. It’s inevitable.\nWe already know that machines are better than humans at physical tasks, they can move faster, more precisely, and lift greater loads. When these machines are also as intelligent as us, there will be almost nothing they can’t do—or can’t learn to do quickly. Therefore, 99 percent of jobs will eventually be eliminated.\nBut that doesn’t mean we’ll be redundant. We’ll still need leaders (unless we give ourselves over to robot overlords) and our arts, music, etc., may remain solely human pursuits too. As for just about everything else? Machines will do it—and do it better.\n“But who’s going to maintain the machines?” The machines.\n“But who’s going to improve the machines?” The machines.\nAssuming they could eventually learn 99 percent of what we do, surely they’ll be capable of maintaining and improving themselves more precisely and efficiently than we ever could.\nThe above argument is sound, but the conclusion that 99 percent of all jobs will be eliminated I believe over-focused on our current conception of a “job”. As I pointed out above, there’s no guarantee that the future will play out like the past. After continuing to reflect and learn over the past few years, I now think there’s good reason to believe that while 99 percent of all current jobs might be eliminated, there will still be plenty for humans to do (which is really what we care about, isn’t it?).\nThe one thing that humans can do that robots can’t (at least for a long while) is to decide what it is that humans want to do. This is not a trivial semantic trick; our desires are inspired by our previous inventions, making this a circular question. — The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future, by Kevin Kelly\nPerhaps another way of looking at the above quote is this: a few years ago I read the book Emotional Intelligence, and was shocked to discover just how essential emotions are to decision making. Not just important, essential. People who had experienced brain damage to the emotional centers of their brains were absolutely incapable of making even the smallest decisions. This is because, when faced with a number of choices, they could think of logical reasons for doing or not doing any of them but had no emotional push/pull to choose.\nSo while AI and automation may eliminate the need for humans to do any of the doing, we will still need humans to determine what to do. And because everything that we do and everything that we build sparks new desires and shows us new possibilities, this “job” will never be eliminated.\nIf you had predicted in the early 19th century that almost all jobs would be eliminated, and you defined jobs as agricultural work, you would have been right. In the same way, I believe that what we think of as jobs today will almost certainly be eliminated too. But this does not mean that there will be no jobs at all, the “job” will instead shift to determining, what do we want to do? And then working with our AI and machines to make our desires a reality.\nIs this overly optimistic? I don’t think so. Either way, there’s no question that the impact of artificial intelligence will be great and it’s critical that we invest in the education and infrastructure needed to support people as many current jobs are eliminated and we transition to this new future.\nOriginally published on April 1, 2017.

The current debate centers not on whether these changes will take place but on how, when, and where the impact of artificial intelligence will hit hardest. In this post, I’ll be exploring both optimistic and pessimistic views of artificial intelligence, automation, job loss, and the future.\nTechnlogy-driven societal changes, like what we’re experiencing with AI and automation, always engender concern and fear—and for good reason. A two-year study from McKinsey Global Institute suggests that by 2030, intelligent agents and robots could replace as much as 30 percent of the world’s current human labor. McKinsey suggests that, in terms of scale, the automation revolution could rival the move away from agricultural labor during the 1900s in the United States and Europe, and more recently, the explosion of the Chinese labor economy.\nThree waves of automation that might unfold over this period:\nWave 1 (to early 2020s): algorithmic\nWave 2 (to late 2020s): augmentation\nWave 3 (to mid-2030s): autonomy\nDuring the first wave, we expect relatively low displacement of existing jobs, perhaps only around 3% by the early 2020s. But job displacement could increase in later waves as these technologies mature and are rolled out across the economy in increasingly autonomous form.\nBy the mid-2030s, up to 30% of jobs could be automatable, with slightly more men being affected in the long run as autonomous vehicles and other machines replace many manual tasks where their share of employment is higher. During the first and second waves, however, women could be at greater risk of automation due to their higher representation in clerical and other administrative functions.\nThese estimates are median values across 29 countries, with the UK being very close to the average. Long-term automation could be lower at only around 20-25% in Asian and Nordic countries, but could be higher at over 40% in some Eastern European countries according to our analysis\nLooking back on history, it seems reasonable to conclude that fears and concerns regarding AI and automation are understandable but ultimately unwarranted. Technological change may eliminate specific jobs, but it has always created more in the process. Beyond net job creation, there are other reasons to be optimistic about the impact of artificial intelligence and automation.\nBy eliminating the tedium, AI and automation can free us to pursue careers that give us a greater sense of meaning and well-being. Careers that challenge us, instill a sense of progress, provide us with autonomy, and make us feel like we belong; all research-backed attributes of a satisfying job.\nAnd at a higher level, AI and automation will also help to eliminate disease and world poverty. Already, AI is driving great advances in medicine and healthcare with better disease prevention, higher accuracy diagnosis, and more effective treatment and cures. When it comes to eliminating world poverty, one of the biggest barriers is identifying where help is needed most. By applying AI analysis to data from satellite images, this barrier can be surmounted, focusing aid most effectively.\nCourtsey : https://www.pwc.co.uk/services/economics-policy/insights/the-impact-of-automation-on-jobs.html#cta-1\nhttps://www.iotforall.com/impact-of-artificial-intelligence-job-losses/\n5\nLike Comment\nTo view or add a comment, sign in", "Are We Prepared for the Rise of Automation?\nBy: Greg Robinson on\n                      September 25th, 2018\nPrint/Save as PDF\nAre We Prepared for the Rise of Automation?\nAutomation\nWe are barreling toward a future of automation. A great proportion of the six million US manufacturing jobs that have disappeared over the last few decades were lost as a direct result of automation’s slow absorption of physical labor and factory work. Now the pace is quickening. Because of the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the reach of automation is expanding, too.\nHow Automation Could Displace Workers\nAccording to Elon Musk, self-driving cars will displace 15% of the world’s workforce. Musk warns that driverless cars are closer than they might appear. Increasingly, trading on the stock market is becoming automated. A staggering 70% of daily trading is done by software instead of humans, which has resulted in massive job losses for stockbrokers and traders.\nQuantitative analysts, investors who use complex mathematical models to assess the market, are being outclassed by artificial intelligence. AI-led hedge funds are beating out human-led quant firms by considerable margins.\nCars and stocks won’t be the only industries affected by automation’s expansion, either. Indeed, President Obama made mention of the automation and artificial intelligence issue during his farewell speech, stating, “The next wave of economic dislocations won’t come from overseas. It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good middle-class jobs obsolete.”\nMounting Evidence for Future Employment and Wage Gap\nIn an MIT paper published this year by the well-regarded economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo, a pair previously optimistic about artificial intelligence’s effect on jobs found valid reasons for alarm. “As robots and other computer-assisted technologies take over tasks previously performed by labor, there is increasing concern about the future of jobs and wages,” the paper reads. “[W]e estimate large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages.”\n“Who is winning the race for jobs between robots and humans? Last year, two leading economists described a future in which humans come out ahead. But now they’ve declared a different winner: the robots,” writes Claire Cain Miller for The New York Times about the evidence for automation’s effects on businesses and employment.\n“Robots are to blame for up to 670,000 lost manufacturing jobs between 1990 and 2007, [the paper] concluded, and that number will rise because industrial robots are expected to quadruple.” According to another paper, one published by Oxford in 2013, 47% of total US employment could be at risk.\nOthers still contend that while artificial intelligence may displace workers in the short term, we can expect jobs to be created from the robots themselves. Self-serve gas pumps eliminated thousands of US jobs but were quickly replaced by better-paying ones, for example.\nWorkers were pushed into attaining higher education, swept into the middle class, or lost in poorer wages. “Just as cranes replaced dockworkers but created related jobs for engineers and financiers, the theory goes, new technology has created new jobs for software developers and data analysts,” Miller wrote about Acemoglu and Restrepo’s older, more optimistic paper.\nEconomic Shifts Could Lead to a Universal Basic Income\nBut, the paper touting automation’s potential to render new jobs weren’t based on real-world data. While it is true that we have seen benefits arise from automation, there is no reason to expect this to be the rule in the future.\nAs artificial intelligence grows more intelligent and automation gains new abilities, are we preparing for the inevitable economic shifts? According to the MIT Technology Review, the US government spends an abysmal .1% of its GDP on programs that assist people in workplace shifts like this -- an appallingly low number when compared to other developed countries -- and that percentage that has been dwindling for the last three decades.\nAutomation has become an imminent threat to some- one that requires immediate solutions- most notably in the form of more robust social protections. A universal basic income (UBI) has been supported by vocal Silicon Valley elites. The income would guarantee that poverty would not become an epidemic, regardless of the job market.\nConclusion\nThere are no plans to implement an emergency infrastructure through the UBI on a federal level, however. “We should not advance a policy that is premised on giving up on the possibility of workers’ remaining employed,” a White House report published last year argues.\nDespite the fact that there have been examples of well-funded tech startups giving small stipends to families with reasonable success, resulting in more productivity through automation and education among participants.\nAutomation is looming over the workforce. Whether it will bring widespread negative or positive effects is yet to be seen. Little has been proposed to prepare the American workforce for the rise of AI, and no protections for the poor or middle classes have been seriously considered on a federal level.\nWhat will become of the job market and the future of work itself remains shrouded in mystery. The future is drawing near, but we may not be drawing up solutions as fast as we should be.\nAbout Greg Robinson\nGreg Robinson is a tech entrepreneur with interest in emerging technologies particularly VR/AR, 3D technologies as well as how artificial intelligence will impact the future of work.\nConnect with Greg Robinson", "How Will Machines and AI Change the Future of Work?\nHow Will Machines and AI Change the Future of Work?\nScience & Technology\nHow Will Machines and AI Change the Future of Work?\nJanuary 03, 2018\nKuka robots work on Tesla Model S cars in the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., Thursday, May 14, 2015. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)\nPop-out player\nSeveral recent studies examined how machine automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will change the future of work.\nSome estimates predict these technologies could displace up to 30 percent of workers worldwide by 2030.\nOne study was published by PricewaterhouseCoopers, an international company providing financial and tax services. It predicted about 38 percent of American jobs could be at high risk for automation by the early 2030s. In Germany, up to 35 percent of jobs could be at risk. The company said about 30 percent could be affected in Britain and 21 percent in Japan.\nThe risk of being displaced will greatly increase for workers with less education, PricewaterhouseCoopers said. It estimated that in Britain, up to 46 percent of workers without a college degree could be at risk due to automation. This would drop to about 12 percent for workers with undergraduate degrees or higher.\n“New smart machines have the potential to replace our minds and to move around freely in the world,” the study said. It added that the greatest job displacement is expected to come in the areas of transportation, storage, manufacturing and retail.\nThe Rand Corporation recently issued its own report on the future effects of automation and AI on jobs and the workplace. Osonde Osoba was a co-author of the report. He noted that fears over machines taking jobs from humans goes back centuries.\nIn 16 th century England, Queen Elizabeth famously refused an inventor’s request for a patent for a device to make material for clothing. The Queen explained that the device would lead to major job losses, forcing affected workers to become “ beggars .”\nOsoba agrees there will be major job disruptions due to AI and automation, especially for lower skilled workers. But he told VOA he believes the future problems have been overestimated without historical evidence to back up the predictions.\nIn this May 25, 2017 photo, employees work a factory floor at a Stihl Inc. production plant in Virginia Beach, Va. There are assembly lines at the Stihl plant, but human workers are interspersed with computers and robotics. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n“It’s not so much that the jobs are getting displaced, it’s more like tasks are getting displaced and jobs are reconfiguring over time to account for that automation.”\nHe added that it will be very difficult for companies to completely automate most jobs, because they require a worker to perform many different duties and to react to unexpected situations.\nThe RAND report identifies three job types that will be very difficult to replace with a machine. These include jobs depending on human motor skills, positions requiring creative thinking and actions, and jobs dealing with intense social interaction.\nThere are recent examples of companies like Google and Facebook using AI to limit certain kinds of content. Osoba says this can be problematic for machines, which do not understand cultural norms in the population.\n“So that understanding of cultural norms, or social norms or ethical norms, that’s not something that’s easy – at least so far we haven’t found that easy to program into artificial intelligence.”\nThe McKinsey Global Institute, a private think tank, has also studied the issue. Its research suggests that up to one-third of work activities across 46 nations could be displaced by 2030. The organization’s report predicts automation could force 75 million to 375 million workers into new job areas by 2030.\nMcKinsey identified several jobs that will not be easily replaceable by machines. These include health-care providers, engineers, scientists, accountants, technology experts and managers. It also predicted rising demand for educators, and “creatives,” a group of workers including artists, performers and entertainers.\nIn this Thursday, May 25, 2017 photo, an assembly line laborer works across from a collaborative robot, right, at the Stihl Inc. manufacturing facility in Virginia Beach, Va. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\nThe study said automation will also raise productivity and economic growth. It said this growth – along with other economic influences - could help offset the displacement of millions of workers.\n“All workers will need to adapt, as their occupations evolve alongside increasingly capable machines,” the report said.\nMcKinsey says this will require ongoing retraining of workers. In addition, employees will be spending more time on activities difficult to automate. This includes tasks requiring emotional, creative and cognitive skills, the study said.\nRand Corporation’s Osonde Osoba agrees. He says workers will increasingly have to be willing and prepared to regularly change jobs and roles to keep up with technology.\n“If you are thinking about concrete things an individual might do to prepare themselves, I guess being more adaptable, being more flexible, being able to reeducate yourself to fit into a different job.”\nHe added that there will be a great need in the future for many more AI developers and researchers. For this reason, he suggests young people interested in these areas start their career paths early to prepare for these high-paying, competitive jobs.\nI’m Bryan Lynn.\nBryan Lynn reported this story for VOA Learning English.

There is often an assumption that technology is neutral, but the reality is far from it. Machine learning algorithms are created by people, who all have biases. They are never fully “objective”; rather they reflect the world view of those who build them. And unless ...\nThe authority that administers A-Level college entrance exams in the UK, Ofqual, recently found itself mired in scandal. Unable to hold live exams because of Covid-19, it designed and employed an algorithm that based scores partly on the historical performance of the schools students attended. The outcry was immediate, as students who were already disadvantaged found themselves further penalized by artificially deflated scores, their efforts disregarded and their futures thrown into disarray.\nThis is far from an isolated incident. Even the world’s most sophisticated technology companies have faced similar problems. In 2018, Amazon’s recruiting algorithm was flagged for penalizing applications that contained the word “women’s.” More recently, Apple’s credit card algorithm was so biased against women that founder Steve Wozniak’s wife was given a credit limit 10 times lower than his, despite them sharing all assets and accounts.\nInsight Center\nAI and Equality\nDesigning systems that are fair for all.\nClearly, this is unfair. Just as important, these biases undermine efficiency and productivity. If we see a value in putting the best students in the best schools, the inherent bias in Ofqual’s algorithm undermines that purpose. Similarly, a biased recruiting algorithm undermines a firm’s ability to attract the best talent, and a biased credit rating algorithm undermines the ability to make smart credit decisions.\nJust as the costs of bias are substantial, the benefits of eliminating bias can be just as significant. In fact, one econometric study at Stanford University found that at least “25% of growth in U.S. GDP between 1960 and 2010 can be attributed to greater gender and racial balance in the workplace,” and that the figure could be as high as 40%.\nSources of Bias\nIn order to fully unleash the profitable opportunities of AI, we first need to understand where biases come from. There is often an assumption that technology is neutral, but the reality is far from it. Machine learning algorithms are created by people, who all have biases. They are never fully “objective”; rather they reflect the world view of those who build them and the data they’re fed.\nBiased human judgments can affect AI systems in two different ways. The first is bias in the data that systems learn from. You can see this play out for yourself: do a Google image search for “professional haircut,” and another for “unprofessional haircut.” “Professional haircut” turns up results that are exclusively white men, while “unprofessional haircut” has much more gender and racial diversity. (This issue was originally surfaced by Twitter users back in 2016 .)\nIs it really true that only white men have professional haircuts? Of course not. The Google results are based on articles written about professional haircuts. They reflect human editorial decisions to include and prioritize white men. So a supposedly “neutral” search provides a decidedly unneutral outcome. Bias based on historical norms is fairly common.\nA second source of bias occurs in the way algorithms are designed. Machine learning algorithms generally rely on correlation, rather than causal relationships. For example, it’s relatively easy to design an algorithm that will find a relationship between temperature readings and ice cream consumption, showing that as thermometer readings go up, people eat more ice cream.\nOf course, high temperature readings themselves don’t actually cause increased ice cream sales. Putting a thermometer next to a heater will not elicit a sudden rush for something cold. Humans get that. Algorithms often do not. The problem is that there is an intermediate factor, called a confounding factor, that affects both thermometer readings and ice cream sales, namely hot weather, that algorithms are not typically designed to take into account.\nIce cream is a fairly trivial example. But what if correlations between a criminal offender’s zip code and recidivism rates, with poverty as a confounding factor, were used to determine prison terms? Would we be sentencing people to longer prison sentences merely because they were poor? Sadly, there is considerable evidence that this injustice is happening right now, and not just with recidivism rates.\nResearchers, led by artificial intelligence pioneer Judea Pearl, are working to mitigate this type of bias through developing causal AI techniques, but for now at least, our systems are rife with algorithmic bias.\nMitigating Systemic AI Bias\nUnless there is concerted intervention, algorithms will continue to reflect and reinforce the prejudices that hold society and business back. For example, developers should no longer be able to simply insert open source code into systems without knowing what’s in it, and software firms should no longer be able to use the concept of “proprietary algorithms” to obfuscate scrutiny of shoddy code design.\nWe can preempt some of the damage by utilizing ethical AI design principles. We also need to ensure that our algorithms are explainable, auditable, and transparent. Just as we wouldn’t accept humans making major decisions that affect others without any oversight or accountability, we should not accept it from algorithms.\nHere, the Ofqual case is instructive. Because the agency was transparent about how the algorithm was constructed, the source of the bias was quickly revealed, corrective action was taken in a timely manner, and much of the damage was likely mitigated. As Linus’s Law states, “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.”\nEvery AI system needs to be held accountable. We can’t lose sight of the fact that AI systems are tools. They need to be designed to benefit humans, not harm them.\nUnlocking Value by Mitigating Bias\nOne example of the enormous effect systemic bias can have is the market for credit. In the U.S. particularly, there is an ugly history of redlining that discriminated against racial minorities and, to a large extent, effectively locked unfavored groups out of the financial system.\nHowever, banks don’t earn money by turning away performing loans; they earn money by extending loans to good credit risks. It was this simple principle that led the credit bureau Experian to develop its Boost program, which allows so-called “thin file” clients with limited credit history to augment their scores with information about their history paying things like cable and mobile phone bills.\nSince the program launched in January 2019, more than 4 million people have participated. Sixty-one percent of those with “poor” credit — more than 150,000 people — have been able to upgrade to a “fair” rating, giving them far more access to buying a car, renting or buying a home, or acquiring a business loan. Lenders are also able to extend significantly more credit to profitable customers.\nThe company hopes to build on that success with a model that mitigates algorithmic and data biases which affect the evaluation of credit risks. “We believe that by providing fair and equitable assessment for consumers, we are also helping lenders make more informed and profitable decisions,” says Eric Haller, Head of Experian Datalabs. “Everybody wins.”\nOpportunities from minimizing bias extend far beyond the credit industry. We need to start looking at eliminating AI bias less as merely a “nice thing to do,” and more as an economic and competitive imperative. Business leaders take note: By making our AI systems more fair, we can also make our organizations more profitable and productive.\nGreg Satell is an international keynote speaker, adviser and bestselling author of Cascades: How to Create a Movement that Drives Transformational Change.

Artificial Intelligence is Posing These 5 Risks to Humankind\nArtificial intelligence risks are often portrayed in movies and series with an even darker motive\nAdilin Beatrice\nArticle Updated: September 18, 2021\nComments Off\nLong back, when artificial intelligence was at the initial stage of development, a top researcher said the world is ‘summoning the demon.’ Nobody realized the seriousness of the words back then. But seven decades into technology, we are still afraid of the artificial intelligence dystopia that could come over us. Yes, even though technologies like robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, data science, etc are the biggest disruption of the 21st century, they have induced fear among general people of an apocalypse. Artificial intelligence risks are often portrayed in movies and series with an even darker motive, making humans reluctant to tech advancements.\nSome call artificial intelligence a gift to humankind while others disagree with the remark. But the worldly applications of technology represent the sophistication we are enjoying today. The applications of artificial intelligence are changing the tailwind of every industry. It even helps humans solve real-world problems in no time. Still, why do we fear artificial intelligence risks so much? Because what we are seeing today is just the tip of an iceberg. We are in the first phase of AI called Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) and two other advancements like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ANI) are yet to hit the market. Even in the first phase of technological advancement, we are facing many practical issues. For example, the much hailed Autonomous technology killed a car owner in California when he tried Tesla Model 3’s autopilot feature. Similarly, a self-driving Uber vehicle in Arizona killed a pedestrian. Other instances of technology mishaps also represent an upcoming dystopia. Therefore, we take a close look at the possible artificial intelligence risks that are awaiting us.\n5 Risks Artificial Intelligence Could Bring in Future\nJob Automation\nThe immediate risk that artificial intelligence poses to human society is massive job loss. Already many laborious and time-consuming jobs are being taken over by robots and automation. If artificial intelligence gets ready to do intellectual tasks, then it will completely sweep away many employees. According to a study by Brookings Institution in 2019, 36 million people work in jobs with high exposure to automation, putting them always at the risk of unemployment.\nAutonomous Weapons\nDespite signing a number of peace agreements, somewhere in the world, the war is still ongoing. At a time when world leaders are trying to join hands with each other, technological advancements could pose a major threat to their stance. Autonomous weapons or killer robots are anticipated to be the future of warfare. Although they are designed to kill invaders and militants according to pre-programmed instructions, their judgments could go wrong at a certain point. Many questions what will happen if the autonomous robots go awry and kill innocent people.\nAI Discrimination\nIn the 21st century, people are working to erase the thin line called ‘inequality.’ However, it was a tough journey and we are taking small steps every day to stay away from discrimination and bias. But what to do when machines are biased? Yes, that could happen. Robots and AI-powered systems are fed with human-based data. We have evidenced the kind of bias people have in their minds and if that reflects on the machines, then it will be a serious concern. For example, an AI-powered recruitment system could neglect certain resumes because they are from marginalized groups.\nPrivacy Concerns\nChina is blamed by the world for monitoring and keeping an eye on the Uighur population. The country uses surveillance cameras and computer vision technology to identify Uighur people and track their moves. This is just a small hint on how privacy could badly be affected by artificial intelligence. On average, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day. The data is extracted from our daily actions from morning to night. Companies using the data could pose a threat to individuals if they use it wrong.\nArtificial Superintelligence\nAs mentioned earlier, what we are going through now is now the beginning block of technology. Artificial superintelligence is the extreme kind of sophistication that humans have anticipated to see in the coming years. Artificial intelligence refers to systems with an intelligence that far surpasses human intelligence in several respects. As a result, they will be able to learn and train, all by themselves. Therefore, the creation of something similar to human beings could bring a complete dystopia to humankind.\nPrevious post\nTOP 7 AI TOOLS TO BATTLE AGAINST HEARING IMPAIRMENT\nNext post\nALYI Echoes Elon Musk’s Comments On China EV Process\nPosted in:\nLatest News\nTech\nTop News\nTags:\nArtificial Intelligence", "Mitigating AI’s Many Risks to Society - Wikibon Research\nMitigating AI’s Many Risks to Society\nBY James Kobielus NOVEMBER 12 2018\nDownload\nEmail\nPrint\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is rife with risks. Some of these may stem from design limitations in a specific buildout of the technology.  Others may be due to inadequate runtime governance over live AI apps. Still others may be intrinsic to the technology’s inscrutable “ blackbox ” complexity.\nWikibon refers to this overarching societal concern as “ AI risk management .” Generally, this refers to the myriad of ways in which the technology may adversely impact society, as well as the various technological, procedural, regulatory, and other guardrails to mitigate the most worrisome threats. Check out this recent Wikibon Action Item for a wide-ranging crowdchat on this topic.\nAI’s principal risks to society include:\nCan we prevent AI from invading people’s privacy?\nCan we eliminate socioeconomic biases that may be baked into AI-driven applications?\nCan we ensure that AI-driven processes are entirely transparent , explicable, and interpretable to average humans?\nCan we engineer AI algorithms so that there’s always a clear indication of human accountability, responsibility, and liability for their algorithmic outcomes?\nCan we build ethical and moral principles into AI algorithms so that they weigh the full set of human considerations into decisions that may have life-or-death consequences?\nCan we automatically align AI applications with stakeholder values, or at least build in the ability to compromise in exceptional cases, thereby preventing the emergence of rogue bots in autonomous decisionmaking scenarios?\nCan we throttle AI-driven decision making in circumstances where the uncertainty is too great to justify autonomous actions?\nCan we institute failsafe procedures so that humans may take back control when automated AI applications reach the limits of their competency?\nCan we ensure that AI-driven applications behave in consistent, predictable patterns, free from unintended side effects, even when they are required to dynamically adapt to changing circumstances?\nCan we protect AI applications from adversarial attacks that are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in their underlying statistical algorithms?\nCan we design AI algorithms that fail gracefully, rather than catastrophically, when the environment data departs significantly from circumstances for which they were trained?\nAI risk mitigation has become a popular topic on the mainstage at tech conferences. Researchers can tap into a growing pool of grants that fund innovative approaches for addressing the problem, much of it coming from the coffers of big technology vendors. And it’s a challenging time for legislators, policy analysts, and others trying to bring coherence to the confusing, overlapping, and sparse regulatory mechanisms for dealing with all of this. For a dissection of the likely global regulatory fall-out around facial recognition, for example, check out my recent InformationWeek column on the topic.\nAI risk management is the focus of a growing curriculum that’s essential study for the next generation of data scientists and other application developers. AI safeguards will almost certainly find their way into future waves of commercial devices, applications, and cloud services, though it’s clear that these will need to coalesce into a broader body of risk mitigation practices in order to be effective.\nIf you’re a developer, certifying an AI application, service, or product as a manageable risk is possible. However, as I discussed in this recent Dataversity article, it will need to holistically address the following risk factors:\nAI rogue agency: AI must always be under the control of the user or a designated third-party. Testing should certify that users can always rescind AI-driven decisioning agency in circumstances where the uncertainty is too great to justify autonomous actions.\nAI instability: AI’s foundation in machine learning means that much of its operation will be probabilistic and statistical in nature, rather than according to fixed, repeatable rules. It should be possible to certify that the AI fails gracefully, rather than catastrophically, when environment data departs significantly from circumstances for which they were trained.\nAI sensor blindspots: When AI is incorporated into robots, drones, self-driving vehicles, and other sensor-equipped devices, there should be some indication to the consumer about the visuals, sounds, smells, and other sensory inputs they’re unable to detect under realistic operating environments. Independent testing could have uncovered this risk, as well as any consequent risks from faulty collision avoidance and defensive maneuvering algorithms.\nAI privacy vulnerabilities: Considering that many AI-driven products, such as Alexa, are in the consumer end of the Internet of Things, there must be safeguards to prevent them from inadvertently invading people’s privacy, or from exposing people to surveillance hack attacks by external parties.\nAI adversarial exposure: Vulnerabilities in your deep neural networks can expose your company to considerable risk if they are discovered and exploited by third-parties before you even realize or have implemented defenses. Testing should be able to certify that AI-infused products are able to withstand some of the most likely sources of adversarial attacks.\nAI algorithmic inscrutability: Many safety issues with AI may stem from the “ blackbox ” complexity of its algorithms. Independent testing of an AI product should call out the risks a consumer faces when using products that embed such algorithms. And there should be disclaimers on AI-driven products that are not ideally transparent , explicable, and interpretable to average humans.\nAI liability obscurity: Just as every ingredient in the foodchain may be traceable back to a source, the provenance of every AI component of a product should be transparent. Consumer confidence in AI-infused products rests on knowing that there’s always a clear indication of human accountability, responsibility, and liability for their algorithmic outcomes. In fact, this will almost certainly become a legal requirement in most industrialized countries, so testing labs should start certifying products that ensure transparency of accountability.\nThere is a perfect storm of AI nasties just waiting to happen. The human race has barely begun to work through the disruptive consequences of this bubbling cauldron of risk. And let’s not  overlook the trend toward AI’s weaponization, which poses an existential threat any way you look at it. In my recent SiliconANGLE column on the technology’s central role in military initiatives everywhere. Check out my recent Datanami article on the threat that AI-driven drones pose to civil defenses, in which I go into depth on advances in counterdrone technology.\nYes, we can protect society from many, but not all of these AI downsides. However, many tradeoffs must be made and many people may find the resulting technological, regulatory, and other remedies disproportionate to the peril. And we need political leadership everywhere who are themselves not going rogue on these matters.\nBut we would be naïve to believe that society can ever fully protect itself from all the adverse consequences that may befall us from our AI inventions. The sounder minds among us will have to erect guardrails to keep it all in check without denying humanity the many amazing fruits that AI promises.\nJAMES KOBIELUS's latest research\nApplication Development, Deep Learning, and Data Science\nDownload\nEmail\nPrint", "Ethical aspects of Artificial Intelligence, part 1/2: Algorithmic bias - Datascience.aero\nEthical aspects of Artificial Intelligence, part 1/2: Algorithmic bias\nDamir Valput\n2020-07-09 13:14:45\nSafety, Technology\nReading Time: 7 minutes\nAs we rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to handle an increasing number of areas of our lives, the issues of privacy and the fairness of AI algorithms are being discussed more in society. Therefore, I decided to dedicate my following two posts on here to those topics. Today, I delve into the question of algorithmic fairness and algorithmic bias.\nWhat? Algorithms can be… bigots?\nWhen I mention algorithmic bias in this post, I am not referring to bias as the statistical measure commonly used by Machine Learning practitioners, but as a “prejudice against an individual or a group”. Yes, as it turns out, algorithms can be prejudiced. Sort of…\nA number of fields and methods within those fields, such as medical diagnosis, human resources and hiring, transportation, etc. already rely on algorithms to deliver automated decision-making. The advantages of artificial intelligence making a decision for us, in addition to saving us time and saving us from decision fatigue, is that algorithmic decision-making can process a much larger quantity of data than a human could and thus could be said to be less subjective than humans.\nThe reality seems to be slightly different. A number of studies have shown that ML algorithms can too be prone to delivering unfair and biased outputs. Biases in data fed to the algorithms are inevitable, and a well-performing model that is good at picking up statistical patterns in the historical data is also going to be prone to those biases. Furthermore, a prediction model might become inherently prone to committing the same biases as humans as it will propagate them throughout its future decision-making once learnt. However, predictive algorithms we develop should be in accordance with The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality and discourages discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, and other protected features.\nOne of the more famous examples of bias learnt by a machine learning algorithm was discovered by Bolukbasi et al. and described in the paper titled Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings. Word embeddings are vectors that represent a word or a common phrase and are used in computations performed by algorithms that operate over texts. Bolukbasi et al. have discovered that such embeddings can learn gender biases and thus encapsulate those biases in vectorial representations that are used in subsequent learning algorithms.\nThe title of the paper was motivated by a particular example of sexism implicitly contained in the embeddings. Following simple algebraic manipulations over vectors of word embeddings, they noticed that the system, when asked to complete the analogy “ man is to computer programmer as woman is to x ”, gives the answer x=homemaker. Needless to say, most people today would not agree with that analogy. Yet, based on the historical data fed to the algorithm, it was incorporated into the learnt language model.\nFigure 1. Illustration of gender bias in a 2D vector space. The distance between vectors representing the terms “woman” and “homemaker” is quite shorter than the distance between “man” and “homemaker”. Similar for the term “computer programmer”\nWhere do algorithms learn biases from?\nUnfairness can stem from a variety of sources. In the above example of biased word embeddings, gender bias was captured in vectorial word representations due to its presence in the historical data used to train the model. In other words, it was contained in the ground truth fed to the algorithm. That is one of the most common sources of algorithmic bias as datasets used for training ML models contain historically biased human decisions and ML models do an excellent job at picking upon them and eventually replicating them in their outputs.\nHowever, that is not the only source of algorithmic bias. Biases can be caused as well by missing values in the data (e.g. a part of population underrepresented in the dataset), erroneous values, or even objective functions that the algorithms aim to minimise, which can benefit majority groups over minorities. Even with perfectly labelled data, a model can produce discriminatory forecasts; a fairly recent example of that is Google’s algorithm that occasionally labelled black people as gorillas.\nThis is becoming increasingly problematic as more algorithms are being used in fairness-critical applications such as criminal processing, background checks, hiring processes, etc. Ideally, we would like the algorithmic decision-making to be free of the biases we consider harmful, even when they are present in the data used to train the model. For example, imagine a model used to perform background checks of air travellers in order to detect potentially dangerous individuals and label them for additional screening at the airport. As has been observed before, such criminal processing algorithms can pick up on racial biases and discriminate against certain minority groups.\nHow to decide what is fair?\nWhile most of us would most likely agree that the bias example above is harmful and unfair, it is not always easy to define what constitutes a bias in algorithmic decision-making. There is no universal technique that can ensure fairness in every situation. Moreover, we need to make sure that we are removing only harmful unwanted biases, not unbiased information that might be relevant for the accurate performance of the model (depending on its purpose).\nResearchers describe algorithmic fairness in general terms as absence of any prejudice or favoritism toward an individual or a group based on their inherent or acquired characteristics. Therefore, algorithmic fairness should aim at eliminating biases against any individual and against a group of people.\nWith group bias, we wish to partition the population of interest into various groups and make sure that the statistical measures we use to capture fairness are equalised across those groups. On the other hand, i ndividual fairness aims to observe similar individuals and ensure that they are treated similarly (by the algorithm and its output).\nFairness as a mathematical concept\nIn order to model fairness, detect the lack of it in algorithmic outputs, measure it and ultimately eliminate it from a model, we should be able to express it using tangible mathematical concepts. This is where we could really benefit from a universally accepted measure of a degree of fairness ; however, as already mentioned, there is no such thing (yet) and we need to look at each specific problem at hand.\nOne proposal towards identifying and quantifying fairness for a specific problem consists of questioning stakeholders on their beliefs on fairness and eventually reaching a consensus on its definition relevant for the application under development. While translating that consensus back to the algorithm is a challenge of its own, the work of Bolukbasi et al. gives us hope that there are feasible solutions and that oftentimes the same techniques used to detect an undesirable bias can be used to eliminate it as well.\nHowever, in doing so, we need to make sure that removing the bias does not seriously dampen the forecasting or decision-making power of the algorithm.\nFairness and accuracy don’t go hand in hand\nAs it turns out, there is a trade-off between accuracy of a predictive algorithm and bias suppression, i.e. fairness. It seems that removing harmful biases from ML models is difficult to do without diminishing accuracy of the algorithm. However, there is also research that shows it might be possible to suppress that trade-off. In their paper Unlocking Fairness: a Trade-off Revisited, M. Wick, S. Panda and J.B. Tristan found that, upon performing experiments under controlled conditions, that fairness and accuracy can work together. Whether fairness can be improved without sacrificing accuracy is still an open question.\nMoreover, incorporating fairness metrics into the formulation of already existing ML models is not easily done without increasing their complexity. Lastly, there is also a trade-off among mutually exclusive definitions of fairness that are not reconcilable, even when they are all commonly accepted and valid. Therefore, it is important to understand that fairness comes both with an upper bound and a tax to accuracy.\nFigure 2. There seems to be an unavoidable trade-off between fairness and accuracy (similarly as there is one between precision and recall). Image borrowed from the paper Unlocking Fairness: a Trade-off Revisited.\nWhat is being done to increase algorithmic fairness?\nThere is a significant amount of work being done recently in the data science community to address the problem of algorithmic fairness of predictive models.\nOne idea relies on continuously retraining the models with fresh data, assuming it will lead to an eradication of historical biases in the data itself as it reflects (positive) changes in the society. Obviously, this is more of a long-term solution. Relatedly, there is also the idea of continuously testing models for bias presence.\nAnother data science technique relies on removing features highly correlated with the protected feature (the one which we wish to control for bias, e.g. gender) as ML algorithms could still pick up biases via those features even if the protected feature had been removed. However, there is still a need for a more holistic approach. Along that line, a group of researchers from the University of Toronto recently developed an approach to learning fair representations, which can help achieve both group and individual fairness.\nWhile data science techniques can help deal with this issue, algorithmic bias is not just a data science problem. From discussing who decides what is fair and how stakeholders should be involved in those discussions, to enabling mechanisms for ensuring fairness, the work in algorithmic fairness needs to involve experts from various disciplines. For example, as of 2017, IEEE is aiming to develop algorithmic fairness standards. As we move towards a future more driven by intelligent machines’ decision-making, we can expect to see algorithm audits being performed across various industries, which will include aviation industry as well. However, we are still far from establishing the methodologies on how to perform such audits.\nAlgorithmic fairness in (aviation) industry\nWith AI technologies increasingly finding their place in the aviation industry, we need to be aware of the potential risks associated with algorithmic biases and how easily they can creep into ML models without us realising it. In the aviation industry, we can expect to have to deal with algorithmic bias in many applications: from general ones like computer vision (e.g. automatic face identification of travellers) or in hiring processes (e.g. screening or testing job candidates); to more aviation industry-specific applications such as before mentioned security threats detection.\nWhile the academia and scientific community are now fairly conscious of the problem of algorithmic fairness, the aviation industry still lags behind. Many of the discoveries that are almost considered common knowledge in academia are not being successfully transferred to industry; oftentimes, data scientists working in the industry do not think of algorithmic fairness.\nAlgorithmic fairness analysis should be added as a step into the data science workflow across all data science projects. By raising consciousness about this problem in the aviation industry, we will be one step closer to making the aviation community more acceptable and welcoming of AI.\n***\nMachine Learning algorithms have been proven time and time again to be excellent in picking up statistical patterns in historical data. It’s just that sometimes we don’t want them to repeat history. Ultimately, we could even leverage the potential of AI to detect and correct conscious and even unconscious biases and bring about positive change.\nReferences:\nTolga Bolukbasi, Kai-Wei Chang, James Zou, Venkatesh Saligrama, Adam Kalai.

It has the potential of completely modernizing and automating the businesses. The smart digital operations are also expanding in almost every industry so that they can efficiently serve the customers. The education sector is also in a race to catch up with artificial intelligence trends.\nThe educations institutes like higher, elementary, and professional learning environments are shifting towards AI. The main reason such drastic transformation occurs is to offer better services to the learners. Compared with the traditional learning process, the modern learning ways that utilize AI will assist the learners in accomplishing their learning goals. But the main challenge that the education service providers have to deal with is understanding students' learning power because it differs from one another. The learners have different understanding rates as learning, and thinking capabilities differ from one student to another.\nTherefore, artificial intelligence is the best choice for educational centers to overcome such challenges in learning new things. Artificial intelligence in education will help them to make the learning procedure seamless. It will also assist the educators in offering better, informed, and personalized services to the students.\nMoreover, artificial intelligence-based education apps play a significant role in enhancing learning and training procedures. Regardless of time and location, the students will have access to the course materials and listen to demo sessions of the subjects due to AI technologies.\nThe AI-based devices provide personalized learning services to each student. By utilizing the power of machine learning (ML) algorithms, the AI-enabled education system is modifying the learning materials according to the students' knowledge, experience, and learning mode.\nAI systems even utilize an interactive interface that helps the students offer feedback on lectures and explain if they do not understand the concept.\nSee Also:\nTop Education Technology Solution Companies\nTop Education Technology Consulting/Services Companies\nArtificial Intelligence\nMachine Learning", "Key Applications Of AI In The Education Sector\nEditor's Pick )\nLuke O'Brien, CIO, ISS Facility Services Australia & New Zealand\nKey Applications of AI in the Education Sector\nApac CIO Outlook | Friday, October 01, 2021\nTweet\nAccording to eLearning Industry, in the next three years, up to 47 per cent of learning management solutions will be equipped with AI capabilities.\nFremont, CA: Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are major drivers of development and innovation in all industries, including education. While AI-powered solutions have been around for a while in the EdTech area, the industry has been hesitant to accept them. On the other hand, the pandemic significantly altered the environment, requiring educators to rely on technology for virtual instruction. Now, 86 per cent of educators believe that technology should be an integral component of education. AI can improve both learning and teaching, assisting the education industry is evolving to benefit both students and instructors.\nAI Benefits for Students\nWhen one boil's it down, a student's aim is straightforward: acquire a degree or certification demonstrating their expertise. AI can assist students in accomplishing this aim by simplifying the educational process. AI may significantly influence students' educational journeys by giving access to the proper courses, increasing contact with professors, and freeing up more time to focus on other parts of life. Here are a few examples:\nPersonalization\nPersonalization is one of the most prominent educational trends. Students now have a tailored approach to learning programmes based on their own unique experiences and interests, thanks to the usage of AI. AI can adjust to each student's level of expertise, learning speed, and intended goals to ensure they get the most out of their education. Furthermore, AI-powered systems can assess students' past learning histories, detect deficiencies, and recommend courses best suited for development, allowing for a highly personalized learning experience.\nTutoring\nWhile it is very unusual for kids to require additional assistance outside of the classroom, many teachers do not have the time to assist children after school. AI instructors and chatbots are ideal in these situations. While no chatbot can fully replace a teacher, AI technologies can assist students in honing their abilities and improving weak points outside of the classroom. They offer a one-on-one learning experience without the teacher being available to answer questions at all hours of the day. An AI-powered chatbot can respond to student inquiries in 2.7 seconds.\nQuick responses\nNothing is more aggravating than asking a question and having it answered three days later. Daily, teachers and staff get inundated with repeated inquiries. Through support automation and conversational intelligence, AI can assist students in discovering solutions to their most frequently asked questions in seconds. It not only saves educators a lot of time, but it also saves students time looking for answers or waiting for a response to their queries.\nLearning Management\nEdTech\nMachine Learning", "7 Benefits of AI in Education -- THE Journal\n7 Benefits of AI in Education\nBy David Karandish\n06/23/21\nMachine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are key drivers of growth and innovation across all industries, and the education sector is no different. According to eLearning Industry, upwards of 47% of learning management tools will be enabled with AI capabilities in the next three years.\nWhile AI-powered solutions have been in the EdTech space for some time, the industry has been slow to adopt them. However, the pandemic drastically shifted the landscape, forcing educators to rely on technology for virtual learning. Now, 86% of educators say technology should be a core part of education. AI has the power to optimize both learning and teaching, helping the education sector evolve to better benefit students and teachers alike.\nAI Benefits for Students\nWhen we break it down, a student’s goal is simple: obtain a degree or diploma proving their knowledge. AI can help students achieve this goal by streamlining the education process. By providing access to the right courses, improving communication with teachers and freeing up more time to focus on other aspects of life, AI can make a significant impact on the students’ educational journey. A few examples are:\nPersonalization: Personalization is one of the biggest trends in education. With the use of AI, students now have a personalized approach to learning programs based on their own unique experiences and preferences. AI can adapt to each student’s level of knowledge, speed of learning and desired goals so they’re getting the most out of their education. Plus, AI-powered solutions can analyze students’ previous learning histories, identify weaknesses and offer courses best suited for improvement, providing many opportunities for a personalized learning experience.\nTutoring: While it’s not uncommon for students to require extra help outside of the classroom, many teachers don’t have the free time for students after hours. AI tutors and chatbots are a perfect solution in these scenarios. While no chatbot can truly replace an educator, AI tools can help students sharpen their skills and improve weak spots outside of the classroom. They provide a one-on-one learning experience without having the teacher there to answer questions at all hours of the day. In fact, an AI-powered chatbot can answer student questions at a response rate of 2.7 seconds.\nQuick responses: There is nothing more frustrating than asking a question only to have it answered three days later. Teachers and faculty are often bombarded with repetitive questions on a daily basis. AI can help students find answers to their most commonly asked questions in seconds through support automation and conversational intelligence. Not only does this free up a lot of time for educators, but it also helps students spend less time tracking down answers or waiting for a response to their questions.\nUniversal 24/7 access to learning: AI-powered tools make learning accessible for all students, anytime and anywhere. Each student learns at their own pace, and 24/7 access makes it easier for students to explore what works for them without waiting on an educator. Additionally, students from all over the world can gain access to high-quality education without incurring traveling and living expenses.\nAI Benefits for Educators\nMost teachers and faculty aren’t afraid to admit they struggle with time management, which is understandable given the number of tasks on their daily to-do lists. Educators want to spend more time educating students one-on-one, diving into research and continuing their own education, but don’t have the availability to do so. AI can help free up educators’ time by automating tasks, analyzing student performance and closing the educational gap. Here’s how:\nPersonalization: Just as AI can personalize students’ learning courses, it can do the same for educators. By analyzing the students’ learning abilities and history, AI can give teachers a clear picture of which subjects and lessons need to be reevaluated. This analysis allows teachers to create the best learning program for all students. By analyzing each student's specific needs, teachers and professors can adjust their courses to address the most common knowledge gaps or challenge areas before a student falls too far behind.\nAnswering questions: With access to a school’s entire knowledge base, AI-powered chatbots can answer a variety of generic and repetitive questions students typically ask without involving a faculty member. In bypassing the educator, AI leaves more time for them to focus on lesson planning, curriculum research or improving student engagement.\nTask automation: The power of AI can automate the most mundane of tasks, including administrative work, grading papers, assessing learning patterns, replying to general questions and more. According to a Telegraph survey, teachers spend 31% of their time planning lessons, grading tests and doing administrative work. However, with support automation tools, teachers can automate manual processes, leaving more time to focus on teaching core competencies.\nFrom online textbooks to fully remote lectures, the advancements in edtech are ten-fold. Today, AI plays a role in helping students and teachers optimize and automate both learning and teaching tasks. As the AI industry expands, and innovation is at the forefront, we’ll see improved learning outcomes for all students and educators.\nAbout the Author\nDavid Karandish is Founder & CEO of Capacity — an enterprise artificial intelligence SaaS company headquartered in St. Louis, MO.

Whether people know it or not, artificial intelligence is all around us.\nEverything from gaming services, watching or streaming shows on our televisions or even buying things online, there is a presence of AI everywhere. Even essay writers have gotten in on the act and are using AI to deliver good quality service to students on their websites.\nThe one thing many people ask themselves these days is, what are the benefits of artificial intelligence in the education sector?\nBenefits of artificial intelligence in education\nArtificial intelligence allows tutors to personalize their classes\nOne of the best things about AI is it doesn’t disrupt classes when they are in session, if anything, they enchanted the learning experience of students while making the lives of tutors very easy.\nEvery student has their own needs that have to be met and it can be challenging for a tutor to meet them all. Some students might have special needs and will require extra attention to them while others might be advanced in their studies. Thanks to AI.\nTutors can adapt to the needs and wants of their students easily and provide them with the best possible learning experience. Tutors can set instructions into a system based on the weaknesses and strengths of every student. There are a few meaningless tasks that tutors must do which can be time-consuming.\nInstead of focusing on their students, they can spend plenty of hours doing these tasks. Assigning them to an AI allows a tutor to focus on the most important thing which is providing students with the best possible education.\nAI can be used to teach students in classrooms\nThere are so many universities and colleges across the world that are using AI to educate their students. Thanks to advancements in technology, machines can now be programmed to do the job that people do like teaching in the classroom as long as they are programmed properly.\nThey can deliver the same experience to students as that of a human being as well as know the amount of knowledge each student has.\nAI can be programmed to grade student assignments/essays\nOut of all the benefits AIs bring to the table, this is perhaps the best one. Grading assignments or tests can be boring for some tutors and it does take away lesson planning and professional development. Leaving it up to the AI means they can focus on teaching and providing a better learning experience.\nAIs can give students constructive feedback on their work\nOnce again, this depends massively on how the machine is programmed. If programmed wrong, it will not give accurate feedback to students. Once students have submitted their work, they can receive constructive feedback as if their work was marked by a human being.\nAI allows colleges to create global classrooms\nThese days it doesn’t matter which part of the world a student is, if they are not able to physically attend a classroom session, they can attend one via a video link. As long as they have a good internet connection at home, they can interact with their peers and AIs with ease.\nAlso read: Top 10 Job Search Websites of 2021\nAI can  provide jobs or roles for skills tutors\nEven if humans do make mistakes from time to time, there will always be a role one can play even in a world where machines can do most of the work. For AIs to perform well, they need to be operated by a well-skilled or qualified person meaning that teachers are not going away any time soon.\nIf teachers are driven away by machines in the education sector, there will be no one operating them which can lead to inconsistencies in student learning. This is why there needs to be a human on-site making sure it is operating smoothly.\nAI makes learning interesting\nIf a student does not find a lesson interesting, they can get bored of it easily. One way to spice things up and bring excitement is to add technology.\nIncorporating technology in education can make lessons more immersive, fun and easy to understand for many students. Tutors can use things such as VR headsets and even simulators to get their messages across to their students.\nAlso read: Blocked On Snapchat: Figure Out What-To-Do, The Fixes, and FAQs\nAI can help colleges monitor how their students are performing\nWith the help of AI, tutors can easily track how their students are performing. Data is entered into the system allowing tutors from various colleges or universities to get a clear picture of who is performing well and who is performing badly. The good thing about AI is they are not a one-time thing. They can be used over and over again all year round.\nA\nAlan Jackson\nAlan is content editor manager of The Next Tech.

But what is its impact on education? Will it help teachers, or make them obsolete?\nIn fact, AI does not detract from classroom instruction but enhances it in many ways. Here are some of the benefits of AI in our educational systems.\nPersonalization. It can be overwhelmingly difficult for one teacher to figure out how to meet the needs of every student in his/her classroom: remedial students, advanced students, ESL students and the disabled all need to have the same access to learning. AI systems easily adapt to each student’s individual learning needs and can target instruction based on their strengths and weaknesses, meaningless work for teachers and a more meaningful learning experience for students.\nTutoring. Yes, it’s already happening: thanks to AI, machines are taking on the role of humans in many capacities, including tutors. As with human tutors, “Intelligent Tutoring Systems” can gauge a student’s learning style and pre-existing knowledge to deliver customized support and instruction.\nGrading. This is arguably one of the most tedious teaching tasks and takes time away from more meaningful and purposeful pursuits, like lesson planning and professional development. Machines are now so far advanced that they can do much more than simply grade an exam with an answer key; they can compile data about how students performed and even grade more abstract assessments such as essays.\nFeedback on course quality. AI can identify instruction gaps in the course content based on student performance on assessments. For example, if a significant percentage of students answer a question incorrectly, AI can zero in on the specific information or concepts that students are missing, so that educators can deliver targeted improvements in materials and methods.\nMeaningful and immediate feedback to students. In an age when most communication occurs online or via text message, students are increasingly hesitant about taking risks in front of teachers and peers. They shrink from receiving critical feedback in such a public forum. With AI, students can feel comfortable to make the mistakes necessary for learning and receive the feedback they need for improvement.\nAs educators, we all have fears about instituting large systemic changes, and sometimes those fears are well grounded. However, we cannot afford to ignore the possibilities that AI offers us for dramatically improving the student learning experience.\nTags edchat Edpolicy Edtech edtechchat\nPrevious Article\nNext Article\nWhy Education Leaders Love Google’s Purchasing Process\nMatthew Lynch", "The Role Of Artificial Intelligence In Improving Education - eLearningInside News\nArticles\nEducation Technology\nThe Role Of Artificial Intelligence In Improving Education\nBy eLearning Inside\nNovember 29, 2021\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has touched new heights in this century, and its impact can be felt in all parts of our life including education. The rise of AI in the education sector has been a topic of research for many professionals, including Ido Roll and Ruth Wylie, and Wayne Holmes, Maya Bialik, and Charles Fadel. Technology is changing the way education used to take place and AI is causing the much-needed disruption in this sector to ensure that learning becomes easy for the students, and teaching becomes easy for the teachers.\nThe objective of artificial intelligence at large is to optimize routine processes by increasing efficiency. Here are a few ways in which AI is bringing a revolution in the education sector.\n1. Personalized lessons\nAI can understand a fair amount about student education. On the basis of that information, AI can create personalized lesson plans to meet the specific needs of the students. The Harvard Business Review reported that AI-based learning systems provide educators with information like the learning style of the students, their progress, and abilities. With personalized learning, the students are offered an educational approach that caters to their individual needs and abilities and thereby, increasing their motivation. Such personalization can help a student who prepares for specific roles, from cybercrime to government jobs.\n2. Tutoring\nMany students require additional help after actual lessons to clarify certain concepts. AI tutors can help solve this issue. For instance, Cloudbot AI can converse with students about the problems that they are facing and further, correct the mistakes of the students in real-time. Even though it cannot totally replace an educator, it can prove to be quite handy in providing a detailed explanation to the student about the problem that they are experiencing.\n3. Accessible learning 24/7\nWith AI-powered learning, time and place is never a restriction. AI, in addition to helping students learn at their very own pace, can also make learning possible from anywhere and any time. For instance, St John’s Church of England is implementing the use of AI for its primary school that creates personalized programs of lessons for the students to study at their own pace. This is especially helpful for the students to work on their very own schedule to learn. Such flexibility reduces the burden from the students which can have a very positive impact on their final grades, from LSATs to their Sarkari Result.\n4. Task automation\nTasks that are required to be done on a daily basis like grading papers and administrative work can be resolved to a large extent with the help of AI. For instance, often admission staff are frequently asked about the admission process and campus life which are repetitive in nature. AI-powered chatbots can address the issue by relieving the burden from admission staff. Arizona State University is one of the universities that have used AI for enhancing the student experience on their campus. Task automation can help the educator to transfer a load of such manual tasks to AI.\nIs The World Ready For AI In Education?\nDataquest stated in an article that in 2020, the usage of AI in the education sector exceeded 1 billion USD, and according to Global Market Insights, it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 40% from 2021 to 2027. A report by Prescient and Strategic Intelligence has indicated that using AI in the education sector can generate a revenue of more than 25.7 billion USD by 2030.\nMany ed-tech start-ups are using AI already, like Riid and Osmo to make their company more lucrative for students and parents. Even though artificial intelligence is not widely used in the education sector at the current time, it will soon become an indispensable part of many schools.\nCurrently, many educational institutions like Kidsense, Nuance, and Querium are using artificial intelligence to create their lesson plans, grade the result of the exams and further, provide helpful feedback to the students. It is essential that this technology is extended further to ensure that every student benefits from the technology to grow as much as they can.\nFeatured Image: Pixabay, Pexels.\nLeave a Reply", "AI in Education: Benefits of AI in the Classroom - STEMpedia\nHome\nBlogs\nAI in Education: Benefits of AI in the Classroom\nAI in Education: Benefits of AI in the Classroom\nJune 4, 2020\nImagine a machine that dispenses candy when the user displays the requested image in front of the trained image model. It can be easily labeled as a real-life experiment of operant conditioning powered by Artificial Intelligence. NeuralCandy, an Android Things project, combines image classifier and sugar highs in one delicious blend. The application asks for a random image to be placed in front of the camera module and if it matches the request, the motor of the candy dispenser is then activated to release the reward. Thus, a specimen of the advantages of AI in education, NeuralCandy is a very useful tool that can be used to enhance children’s ability of cognitive image processing. (If this doesn’t convince you, then there are always candies you can look forward to!). There are endless similar examples of how AI will be influencing the education sector of the world in the coming years.\nAlso read: How Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality in Education Are Changing Learning\nBenefits of AI in the Classroom\nAs cited in one of our articles, education technology is a field of study that signifies the need for technological devices to help students acquire creative thinking skills. While EdTech can be counted as the skeleton of technologically advanced learning methods, teaching AI yields the brains.\nSome people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we’ll augment our intelligence.\n– Ginni Rometty, Former CEO of IBM\nJust like it is helping mankind to complete the tasks that would normally require human intelligence, AI in the classroom will not only buy educators more time to innovate lessons but also enhance the cognitive and critical thinking abilities of the students. In this blog post, we will take a look at the different ways in which AI in education can help shape the sector for a better future.\nHandle Repetitive Tasks\nWe often hear this public outcry – “I don’t have time”. There’s always something or the other popping up and the hours just pass by. Members of the education sector are no exception to this. Most of the time that teachers have left after their lectures goes into grading assignments, tests, and homework. But not anymore. With the advent of artificial intelligence in education, educators will be able to have time in hand to interact with students, come up with new and creative methods of teaching, and think outside of the box. The advantages of AI in education look at the possibility of using AI operated grading machines that can evaluate the objective answers. This is something that is gradually being implemented in institutes. According to VentureBeat, some schools in China have incorporated paper-grading artificial intelligence in the classroom and about 60,000 institutions are quietly testing a machine learning-powered system that can score students’ work automatically, and even offer suggestions where appropriate. AI-based attendance systems will also become a part of the classroom soon.\nIndividualized Education\nIndia houses the highest amount of youth population. The government tries to do its best to provide education to every child with schemes that allow children to get free of cost primary education. However, due to the excessive amount of students allocated to one teacher, it becomes increasingly difficult to pay attention to every child, and hence, the quality of education decreases. AI, our technological superhero, swoops in to save the day here as well. Up until now, all the students have had to fit into one concrete education system even though every mind is different and possesses divergent levels of intelligence. One teacher can not possibly reach out to every level while AI in the classroom can surely provide a personalized education that helps every student.\nAssistant to the Educator\nTo explore another aspect of the advantages of AI in education, let us focus on the difference between Assistant Educator and Assistant to the Educator for a moment. The role of AI is often feared amongst the professors. They are afraid of AI taking over their place. What we want to clear up here is that AI may acquire human intelligence but that does not rule out the importance of actual human presence. What AI does is finish up minimal tasks like grading or recording attendance, helps to teach with educational games or activities based on the technology, and storing student data systematically to make an educator’s work easier. Education still requires a human presence. According to The Hechinger Report, “ Thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, teams of education researchers and computer scientists are experimenting with how to build systems that can “see” into and “listen” in on classrooms and instantly analyze the quality of classroom instruction. ”\nRoom For Improvement\nTo err is human.\n– Alexander Pope\nWith the extensive amount of knowledge that is available in the universe, it wouldn’t be a surprise if humans made some errors in the crafting of syllabus/courses. Artificial Intelligence in education can point out the areas in which there might be an inconsistency. Additionally, as discussed earlier, the cognitive ability of every mind is different. Not every student can understand a particular concept in the same way. AI can ease the process of analyzing the outcomes of every student and provide help to the ones that seem to be struggling.\nPrepares Students for the Future\nIntroducing kids to AI can open a whole new world of opportunities. Looking at the current trends, by teaching AI to young minds, educators can bring them closer to a well-planned career whether it be a high-paying job or their own venture, acquaint them with some of the most useful scientific concepts like coding and big data, give a push to their imagination and in turn, innovation abilities, and also equip them to contribute to the development of the society. Artificial Intelligence is a boon to the world and teaching AI in the classroom will help kids utilize it to its best potential.\nAlso read: Digital Learning: Why E-Learning Websites Are a Boon for Kids Today\nRisks Involved\nImage from rawpixel.com\nAccording to Elon Musk, “ The pace of progress in artificial intelligence (I’m not referring to narrow AI) is incredibly fast. ” Other technological experts like Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking have also stated that AI could be dangerous. So it is fair of common people to take the concept of AI with a grain of salt. But the advantages of AI in education cannot be undermined. As it is, the expected problems that can take place because of AI, such as autonomous weapons, social manipulation are miles away from the education sector. If used properly and in moderation, AI in the classroom could be extremely beneficial.\nWe’re holding a special webinar for directors, principals, heads, and educators of all educational institutions in the K12 industry on AI educational tools for students and how these tools can help prepare them for the future by making them AI-ready.\nRegister NOW to attend the webinar [SCHOOL TEACHERS ONLY]: https://bit.ly/AIEdu-Schools\nIn a Nutshell\nArtificial Intelligence in the classroom, without a doubt, can be a huge help to effective teaching. It can help with various areas of teaching: 1) Take care of basic tedious tasks like grading the tests/assignments 2) It can provide personalized education 3) It can prove to be a handy assistant to the educator 4) Procure accurate analysis of individualized student performances and help the ones who are struggling; to state a few of the many advantages of AI in education.\nFeature image taken from rawpixel.com\nAI in Education, AI in the Classroom, Teaching in AI"]}
{"query_id": "24", "generated_response": "Based on the search results, I'll break down the complex landscape of healthcare systems and the fundamental debates surrounding them.\n\n## The Right vs. Privilege Debate\n\nThe core philosophical divide centers on whether healthcare should be universally accessible or distributed based on ability to pay [4]. This debate fundamentally shapes how healthcare systems are structured:\n\n**Healthcare as a Right perspective:**\n- Views medical care as a basic human right, as recognized in Article 25 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights [4]\n- Supports universal coverage and government involvement in ensuring access\n- Emphasizes that society should shoulder burden to alleviate suffering and preserve lives [4]\n\n**Healthcare as a Privilege perspective:**\n- Believes healthcare should be earned or paid for individually\n- Emphasizes personal responsibility and market-based distribution\n- Prefers minimal government intervention [4]\n\n## Main Factors Affecting Healthcare Systems\n\n### **1. Financing Mechanisms**\nHealthcare systems vary dramatically in their public vs. private control [1]:\n- **Public-dominated systems**: Countries like Luxembourg (93% public funding), Czech Republic (91%), and Slovak Republic (90%) [1]\n- **Private-dominated systems**: The US (56% private sector funding) and South Korea represent the minority [1]\n\n### **2. Payment Methods and Incentives**\nThe method of paying healthcare providers significantly affects costs, access, and quality [1]:\n\n**Fee-for-service systems** create incentives for:\n- Over-utilization of services\n- Higher costs due to volume-based payments\n- Potential quality issues from unnecessary procedures [5]\n\n**Alternative payment methods** like capitation or salary can:\n- Reduce over-utilization\n- Control costs more effectively\n- Potentially improve quality through better coordination [5]\n\n### **3. Economic Resources and Priorities**\nThere's a strong correlation between a country's GDP per capita and healthcare expenditures [1]. However, the level of resources available doesn't determine system structure - economically similar countries can have vastly different healthcare organizations [1].\n\n## Equity and Access Challenges\n\n### **Geographic and Demographic Disparities**\nThe search results highlight significant inequities:\n\n**Rural vs. Urban Access:**\n- Rural areas have 39.8 physicians per 100,000 people compared to 53 per 100,000 in urban areas [3]\n- Rural residents face higher mortality rates from heart disease, cancer, and other conditions [3]\n- Rural hospital closures compound access problems [3]\n\n**Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities:**\n- Communities of color face disproportionate impacts from various health conditions [3]\n- Systemic racism contributes to persistent health inequities [3]\n- Social determinants of health (housing, education, environment) significantly affect health outcomes [3]\n\n### **Financial Barriers**\nEven with insurance, many Americans face:\n- High out-of-pocket costs from deductibles and co-payments [1]\n- Inadequate insurance coverage affecting about one-fifth of insured individuals [1]\n- Over 41 million uninsured Americans facing substantial financial barriers [1]\n\n## Cost Control Challenges\n\nHealthcare spending has been rising faster than GDP in virtually every country since 1960 [1]. Key cost drivers include:\n\n- **Provider incentives**: Fee-for-service systems that reward volume over value [5]\n- **Administrative complexity**: The US spends $89.7 billion annually on administrative costs due to multiple insurance plans and billing systems [1]\n- **Technology proliferation**: Widespread adoption of expensive technologies without adequate cost-effectiveness analysis [1]\n- **Specialist oversupply**: In the US, specialists increased from 50% to 68% of physicians, potentially driving overutilization [1]\n\n## Solutions for Improving Healthcare Systems\n\n### **1. Value-Based Care Models**\nImplementing payment systems that reward outcomes rather than volume:\n- Focus on prevention and wellness\n- Promote coordination between providers\n- Share risk among payers, providers, and sometimes patients [3]\n\n### **2. Comprehensive Coverage with Smart Design**\nA hybrid approach that could satisfy both \"rights\" and \"privilege\" perspectives [4]:\n- Eliminate spending on low-value care that doesn't improve health\n- Use savings to extend high-value care to everyone\n- Allow private payment for unproven treatments while protecting funding for evidence-based interventions [4]\n\n### **3. Address Social Determinants of Health**\nSince 80% of health outcomes relate to social factors rather than medical care [3]:\n- Invest in housing, education, and economic development\n- Focus on environmental health improvements\n- Address systemic inequities beyond healthcare delivery\n\n### **4. Prepaid Group Practice Models**\nThe research suggests advantages of organized delivery systems [5]:\n- Fixed budgets encourage rational resource allocation\n- Salary/capitation payment reduces over-utilization incentives\n- Group settings enable peer review and quality monitoring\n- Consumer involvement in institutional governance\n\n### **5. Technology and Innovation**\nLeverage technological advances to improve access:\n- Expand telehealth services, especially for rural and underserved areas [3]\n- Improve broadband access to support remote monitoring and care\n- Use generic drug programs like CivicaScript to reduce prescription costs [3]\n\n### **6. Workforce Distribution Solutions**\nAddress provider shortages through:\n- Targeted training programs for primary care and rural practice\n- Loan forgiveness for providers serving shortage areas\n- Support for alternative providers like nurse practitioners and physician assistants\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe path forward likely requires acknowledging that pure market solutions and pure government control both have limitations. The most promising approaches combine:\n- Universal financial protection with smart benefit design\n- Payment systems that align provider incentives with patient outcomes\n- Strong public health infrastructure addressing social determinants\n- Organizational models that promote coordination and accountability\n- Consumer engagement balanced with professional expertise\n\nSuccess will require sustained political commitment, stakeholder collaboration, and recognition that healthcare improvements depend on broader social and economic policies beyond the medical system itself [1][3][4][5].", "citations": ["https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/healthcare-systems\n", "https://www.researchomatic.com/healthcare-right-or-privilege-175320.html", "https://www.politico.com/sponsored-content/2021/12/health-system-that-works-for-all\n", "https://www.scu.edu/ethics-spotlight/post-election-reconciliation/a-right-or-a-privilege-how-to-practically-and-ethically-reconcile-two-opposing-views-of-health-care/\n", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690282/"], "contexts": ["Healthcare Systems | Encyclopedia.com\nScience\nEncyclopedias almanacs transcripts and maps\nHealthcare Systems\nHealthcare Systems\nviews 2,219,643 updated\nHEALTHCARE SYSTEMS\n•••\nA healthcare system can be defined as the method by which healthcare is financed, organized, and delivered to a population. It includes issues of access (for whom and to which services), expenditures, and resources (healthcare workers and facilities). The goal of a healthcare system is to enhance the health of the population in the most effective manner possible in light of a society's available resources and competing needs. By the beginning of the twenty-first century access to healthcare had come to be regarded by most countries and the United Nations as a special good that is necessary either as a matter of or pursuant to basic human rights. An examination of healthcare systems therefore includes consideration of the ways in which a particular system addresses commonly held values.\nThe extent and form of a specific system are influenced by a variety of factors, including the unique culture and history of a population or country. What is considered healthcare can vary markedly in accordance with a country's level of development, culture, and social values. Some populations put emphasis on the prevention of disease, whereas others emphasize only the care for or cure of particular illnesses. Definitions of health and disease and of appropriate healthcare providers also are subject to cultural variability.\nA second major influence derives from the priorities given to various ethical values: \"There is no way to adjudicate disputes among the Holy Trinity of cost, quality and access unless a court of values is available to dispense its wisdom\" (Reinhard, pg. 1). Those values include respect for the autonomy of both patients and providers, the maximization of benefit, and the promotion of justice or fairness, understood as equality or liberty.\nBalancing those values has posed a dilemma in the United States. Public opinion polls have revealed that most Americans see access to healthcare as a fundamental right. However, Americans' equally strong belief in individual autonomy and responsibility, the use of the market as a means for distributing goods and services, and fears about government interference create conflict and have led to a fragmented healthcare system.\nA third influence on the structure of a healthcare system is the level of economic resources available. There is a strong positive correlation between economic resources as measured by the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and both healthcare expenditures and the proportion of a nation's GDP that is spent on healthcare (Gerdtham and Jonsson). This indicates that although healthcare generally is valued, countries and individuals may consider food, shelter, and in some instances spending for the military more important. However, although the economic resources available to a country have a great effect on that country's overall expenditures on healthcare, there is nearly as much variation in the forms of the healthcare systems in countries that are economically poor as there is in wealthy countries.\nPublic versus Private Control\nAll governments have some degree of involvement in healthcare because essentially all countries have a centrally funded agency that is concerned with public health issues. The proportion of healthcare expenditures spent on public health tends to be higher in low-income countries, although the level of effort varies greatly from country to country. Government involvement usually includes surveillance of communicable diseases and interventions to prevent or curtail epidemics. Some countries have more extensive government involvement through direct delivery of services (e.g., immunizations, well-child care, screening for developmental disabilities, and treatment of communicable diseases) and programs of health promotion. Public health efforts in the United States are fragmented but have begun to receive more attention as the costs of personal, diseaseoriented healthcare and concerns about bioterrorism have increased.\nBeyond public health measures, healthcare systems vary dramatically with regard to the degree of public versus private control (Anderson et al.). In fact, the extent of government control is probably the most distinguishing characteristic among systems. In most member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) the healthcare system is dominated by the public sector. The OECD countries with a high percentage of revenues from the public sector in 2000 included Luxembourg (93%), the Czech Republic (91%), and the Slovak Republic (90%) (OECD). In a few countries the majority of revenues come from the private sector. In the United States the private sector accounts for about 56 percent of healthcare expenditures. The only other OECD countries that receive a majority of funds (more than 50%) from the private sector are South Korea (56%) and Mexico (54%).\nThe public side of healthcare systems in industrialized countries can be placed into two categories: countries with comprehensive programs and strong government control of virtually all aspects (financing, delivery, quality monitoring) of the system, such as Great Britain, the Scandinavian countries, and the countries of the former Soviet Union, and countries in which the government's role is limited to financing or guaranteeing enrollment for all citizens in a health insurance plan, such as Germany, Belgium, France, and Canada. Both types of systems are characterized by public financing or mandates that guarantee universal coverage, payment that is negotiated between the public sector and providers, and policies regarding facilities and healthcare workers that are modulated predominantly by the public sector.\nIn countries in which the private sector is the dominant payer for healthcare universal coverage is less common, payment varies from provider to provider and insurance company to insurance company, and policies regarding healthcare workers are negotiated in the marketplace. In the United States, for example, patient and professional autonomy are dominant (Reinhard). Most individuals or employers are free to choose from among multiple insurers and providers, and most provider groups have the freedom to choose whom to serve, how much to charge, and what credentials are required to join the group.\nEspecially notable has been the strong distrust of government interventions except when they are deemed necessary to guarantee access to a group that is seen as entitled because of a special service it has rendered (retirees, veterans) or special need (disability, poverty). However, even in the United States there have been a number of occasions (as in 1910, 1935, 1948, 1965, 1972, and 1994) when a reasonably strong attempt was made to provide a substantial increase in government involvement in the healthcare system. Except in 1965 those attempts failed because of a combination of factors, including provider opposition, lack of public consensus, fears of increased government involvement, and relatively comprehensive healthcare benefits that most working Americans receive from employment-based private insurance.\nFinancing\nThe means of financing healthcare, perhaps more than any other aspect of a healthcare system, mirror the values and priorities of a society. As was noted above, unlike the case in the majority of the OECD countries, healthcare financing in the United States is mostly private. There is also little public financing of healthcare in most low-income countries. Because of the high cost of many interventions and the unequal distribution of healthcare costs among individuals, lack of a broad-based system of public financing creates a system in which healthcare is rationed on the basis of the ability to pay.\nBeginning with Germany in 1883, most industrialized nations have implemented a government-coordinated or government-controlled system of financing for personal healthcare services. This varies from the systems in countries such as Great Britain and the former Soviet Union, in which virtually all healthcare is financed through general tax revenues collected by the national government, to systems, such as Canada's, that are financed from both state and national revenues, to those of Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, in which financing is mandated by the national government through required participation in a communityor employment-based insurance funds.\nIn the third type of system most funds are obtained through required contributions based on wages. All countries with strong central control have at least a small market of privately financed healthcare that is used predominantly by the rich and the politically connected. For example, in Germany and the Netherlands the most affluent people are not required to purchase health insurance, and most choose to purchase private health insurance, which gives them better access to medical services. Some countries with mixed systems (e.g., Japan and Australia) have a small market for private health insurance that complements the public-sector benefits.\nThe proportion of public financing of healthcare in the United States has been increasing steadily, rising from about 23.3 percent in 1960 to nearly 44.3 percent in 2000 (OECD). In spite of these increases, there is no universal government-guaranteed or compulsory health insurance. Employer-based or individually purchased private insurance is the most common way people obtain health insurance coverage. A variety of publicly financed programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) provide insurance to persons over age sixty-five and some poor people. They are financed by a spectrum of public financing mechanisms, including federal and local government revenues, the use of income and employment-based taxes, and in some states the revenues from a lottery.\nFinancing for active-duty military personnel, veterans, and Native Americans mirrors the centrally controlled healthcare systems of Great Britain and the former Soviet Union. Revenues come from the federal income tax, and services are provided by public-sector employees. The Medi-care program is financed primarily from a wage tax, whereas Medicaid (for certain categories of disabled and low-income persons) is financed from a combination of state and federal general tax revenues. Financing for some care for the poor who are not eligible for Medicaid comes from general tax revenues at the state or local level that are paid to city and county public hospitals and state mental hospitals.\nThe dominance of a private system of financing in the United States is a reflection of not only that nation's values but also of a number of historical events. The Blue Cross program began in Texas when Baylor Hospital enrolled schoolteachers in an insurance system during the Great Depression as a method to guarantee that hospitalized patients could pay their health bills. Private health insurance grew slowly during the 1930s.\nThe real spread of private health insurance occurred during World War II, when wages but not fringe benefits were frozen as a wartime price-control measure. As more firms began to offer health insurance as a benefit, private insurance companies saw the potential for expanding their markets and encouraging those enrolled in health-insurance plans to buy their other insurance products. Another impetus to the market was the decision by the federal government to exempt healthcare benefits from federal income tax. The large number of insurance plans in the United States, each with its own marketing, benefit packages, premiums, deductibles or copayments, billing, and payment requirements, together with the thousands of private physicians, clinics, and hospitals, has created an immense administrative bureaucracy with aggregate administrative spending of $89.7 billion in 2001 (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services; Levit et al.).\nAccess and Delivery\nA second major characteristic of a healthcare system is access, which has multiple definitions, including the following:\nThe ability to obtain needed care\nThe potential and actual entry of a given population into the health system\nThe timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible outcome\nThe timely use of needed, affordable, convenient, acceptable, and effective personal health services\nDifferent countries approach the issue of access in various ways and define the term differently. Health systems with strong central control, such as those in Great Britain, the Scandinavian countries, and the countries of the former Soviet Union, emphasize equal access to care for all their citizens. Those countries have a single-payment system, with most healthcare providers working as salaried government employees and a single government-defined set of benefits. There tends to be strong emphasis on primary care by general practitioners and relatively tight control of the number and distribution of providers and facilities that provide highly technical services. In some countries this degree of government control results in substantial waiting times for some services and limited access to advanced technologies. Thus, whereas this approach produces an apparently high level of equal opportunity to obtain needed health services, it may deny some individuals access to lifesaving technologies and restrict both provider and patient choices. This depends on the level of spending a country is willing to commit to healthcare.\nCountries with less centralized systems vary more in regard to the level of access. In some countries access to healthcare for the poor is restricted by the ability to pay. Moreover, providers' freedom to choose their patients can restrict access to medical services among insured low-income individuals. For example, many providers in the United States refuse to serve Medicaid recipients because of the low payment rates. In countries with less centralized health systems working individuals employed in low-paying jobs often face financial barriers (high out-of-pocket expenses for copayments, deductibles, or premiums) to receive needed care (Lee and Tollen). Similarly, the limited control of healthcare workers and facility location tends to result in geographic maldistribution of providers and healthcare facilities.\nThe degree of access varies widely in the United States. Financial barriers to access are substantial for more than 41 million Americans without health insurance coverage and about the fifth of insured individuals who have inadequate insurance (Mills; Hadley and Holahan; Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured). Studies have shown that those who are poor and have no health insurance have a markedly lower use of almost all forms of healthcare despite their tendency to have a lower baseline health status. This lack is especially great in terms of primary care and preventive services (Bayer and Fiscella). Although the uninsured have some access to high-technology care, especially in urban areas, through use of the emergency rooms and outpatient clinics of public hospitals, research has shown that they have poorer outcomes of hospitalization (controlling for severity) and a markedly lower use of high technology compared with those who have insurance. There is also growing evidence that limited access to primary care results in not only poorer health outcomes but also higher overall costs through delayed treatment, reduced patient adherence to therapeutic regimens, and increased emergency room and hospital admissions.\nPayment\nThe level and means by which providers of healthcare are paid has a substantial effect on access, costs, and the quality of care. In countries that rely on a private healthcare delivery system (the United States, Canada, France, and Belgium) the predominant mode of payment for physicians who provide ambulatory care is fee-for-service. In most instances physicians bargain with insurers or the government over a fee schedule. In some countries there is a provision that physicians can charge patients more than the allowed fees in certain circumstances. There is concern that the financial incentives inherent in a fee-for-service system result in over utilization of services, especially those reimbursed at higher levels relative to other services. However, the autonomy of providers is preserved, and there is an incentive for increased productivity. Additionally, there is no conflict between the financial interests of providers and their duty to provide all services that are of benefit to patients. Cost-or charge-based reimbursement for institutions (hospitals, nursing homes, etc.) has similar risks and benefits.\nSome insurers in the United States and the Netherlands use capitation (a set payment per person per year) or a set payment per case to pay providers. Capitation payments provide an incentive for healthcare workers and facilities to limit the volume of provided services and allow providers to determine precisely which services to provide. At the same time, case-based payment and capitation create a conflict between the financial incentive of the provider and the interest of the individual patient in receiving all services that are of possible benefit. This can be a problem for people with multiple chronic conditions, who are often the most expensive to treat.\nIn many countries, hospitals are paid on prospectively negotiated global budgets and hospital-based providers, including physicians, are paid on a salaried basis. These methods of payment have little apparent effect on the provision of services to individuals. However, the level of payment may have a profound effect on which technology is acquired and on whether providers expend the time and effort required to provide a given service in general.\nExpenditures and Cost Controls\nSince 1960 in virtually every country expenditures for personal healthcare services have been rising in absolute terms and in relation to GDP (Anderson et al.). Health expenditures have been increasing at a rate nearly double that of other major sectors of some national economies. In some countries concerns are being raised that spending on medical care is occurring at the expense of other socially desirable goods and services. This is especially true in the United States, where despite the highest per capita and GDP-adjusted healthcare spending in the world, healthcare is still not accessible to all, and there is growing concern about other social problems such as deteriorating schools, homelessness, poverty, and crime.\nOne reason for controlling health spending is that there is strong evidence that more healthcare spending does not necessarily buy better health (Newhouse). Even more compelling is the growing evidence that a substantial number of medical-care services may provide only small marginal benefits. Although small benefits and high cost are the norm in industrialized countries, many developing and economically disadvantaged countries cannot provide their populations with even basic public health measures such as immunization and sanitation.\nIn many industrialized countries cost controls have created the potentially unpopular phenomenon of waiting lists. Some countries, notably the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries, have implemented a policy of increasing health spending to eliminate waiting lists.\nThe response of different healthcare systems to the growing problem of cost has in general reflected the basic organization and values of each country. In countries with strong central control there has been increasing pressure to create fixed budgets and establish tight control over the acquisition of advanced technologies (supply-side control). Access to basic health services for everyone has been maintained at the expense of not providing expensive services that are potentially lifesaving for a few individuals.\nBy contrast, in the United States there are relatively fewer advocates for global budgeting. Efforts to reduce costs have focused primarily on enhanced competition (demand-side control). These cost-control mechanisms appear to have produced some one-time reductions in healthcare spending but have had a very modest effect on the rate of growth of expenditures.\nBecause of the seemingly inexorable rise in costs in the United States, employers have been shifting more of the cost of healthcare to employees by increasing employee-paid premiums, eliminating coverage for dependents, increasing copayments and deductibles, or eliminating coverage altogether. The response of private insurance companies to growing cost concerns has been to refuse to insure high-risk employees (medical underwriting) or to tie premiums directly to the previous year's expenditures by a particular group (experience rating). Employers became more aggressive in eliminating benefits such as health insurance for retirees when the labor market became looser and profits decreased. All these factors, along with a rise in the number of part-time workers and employment in small, nonunion service industries that lack medical benefits, have been primary determinants in the increase in the number of working-age individuals in the United States who are without health insurance.\nResources\nThe most visible aspects of any healthcare system are the facilities and personnel involved in the delivery of healthcare. Centralized systems have attempted to provide greater equality in the distribution of facilities and healthcare workers by focusing on the needs of a community rather than on the autonomy of providers and patients. In some centralized systems the national government may determine how many and which types of physicians, nurses, and other healthcare workers are produced; the location of hospitals and the technology they may purchase; and the location of hospital-based and outpatient-care providers. Care is strongly regionalized, with easily accessible primary care for most common healthcare problems, some specialty care available in regional hospitals, and subspecialty and tertiary care confined to a few large teaching centers.\nIn contrast to most other countries, the healthcare system in the United States provides little central control. There has been almost complete autonomy for providers, starting with a system of health-professional education with a substantial number of private schools and little or no restriction on specialty choice, practice, or hospital location or on the availability of technology. Because of the prestige and generous payments for new technology nearly all hospitals provide a full array of high-technology services. This complements a strong trend toward subspecialization among health professionals. In the case of physicians the percentage of generalists versus specialists declined from nearly 50 percent in 1961 to the current 28 percent; if OB/GYN and emergency medicine physicians are included in the generalist category, the figures are 32 percent primary care physicians and 68 percent specialists (Bureau of Health Professionals; Council on Graduate Medical Education). The abundance of specialists, especially those who are trained to perform high-technology procedures, is thought to exacerbate the over utilization of some healthcare services. Conversely, the decline in the number of generalists is believed to be a contributing factor in the poor access to healthcare experienced by persons in rural areas and those with low incomes in urban areas.\nChoices for the Future\nAll countries are continuing to search for better cost-containment and cost-effectiveness mechanisms, including the difficult task of placing limits on the healthcare technologies that provide small marginal benefits to a few individuals at a great cost to the community.\nTension will grow between the values of individual autonomy (reflected in the assumption by patients that the right to healthcare includes all interventions that are of possible benefit and the assumption by providers that they have the right to set prices and choose where and whom to serve) and concern for the good of the community and other societal needs. Attempts to achieve equality in the systems of financing, payment, cost control, and delivery will have to take into account increasing competition for limited resources and the perceived infringement on personal freedom. Balancing these competing claims will be especially difficult in the United States with its multiple systems and distrust of government involvement in human services.\nA renewal of a sense of community and a careful balancing of values will be necessary in achieving a reasonable solution. Although the future is unclear, the United States probably will reconsider policies for rational allocation between healthcare and other sectors of the economy, government regulation to require universal and equitable access to defined basic insurance policies, mandated employer-based insurance with a publicly financed safety net, payment based on capitation with some adjustment for the severity of illness in a specific group of patients, and incentives (including scholarships and loan forgiveness) for providers who choose to provide primary care in shortage areas.\nl. gregory pawlson\njacqueline j. glover (1995)\nrevised by varduhi petrosyan\ngerard f. anderson\nSEE ALSO: Advertising; Health Insurance; Health Policy in International Perspective; Health Policy in the United States; Healthcare Institutions; Healthcare Resources, Allocation of; Hospital, Contemporary Ethical Problems of\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nAnderson, Gerard; Reinhardt, Uwe; Hussey, Peter; and Petrosyan, Varduhi. 2003. \"It's the Prices, Stupid: Why the United States Is So Different from Other Countries.\" Health Affairs 22(3): 89–105.\nBayer, William H., and Fiscella, Kevin. 1999. \"Patients and Community Together: A Family Medicine Community-Oriented Primary Care Project in an Urban Private Practice.\" Archives of Family Medicine 8: 546–549.\nBlank, R.

Healthcare is a fundamental need and human right. There are millions of Americans who are still uninsured. Those people who are poverty stricken in the world suffer from worst and poorest health status. There are many factors that are responsible for acquiring better healthcare. These factors include education, employment, race and income. For those who cannot access proper healthcare by themselves should be provided with funds in order to provide good healthcare to them. The question arises that whether healthcare is right, or it's just a privilege. Accessing healthcare considered being a right according to the western thought. Every human being is valuable morally and ethically. Thus, it is the right of every human being to access healthcare and breathe in a healthy environment.\nAbstractii\nHealthcare: Right or Privilege1\nThesis statement1\nIntroduction1\nHealthcare Coverage2\nBackground3\nHealthcare As A Right4\nUtilitarianism And Health Care5\nRelativism, Emotivism And Ethical Egoism6\nConclusion7\nReferences8\nHealthcare: Right or Privilege\nThesis statement\nHealthcare is a right for all human and it is not a privilege because “a healthy man has thousand wishes, a sick man has only one”.\nIntroduction\nHealthcare system in the United States is weakening as the time is passing by. There are almost 47 million people in America who are lacking health insurance (Papadimos, 2007). These 47 million people are unable to access healthcare because they are restricted. Millions of people are uninsured. Health care costs are increasing (Papadimos, 2007). The major problem for the lack of healthcare insurance is the economic problem. There are two fundamental reasons that are liable to lack of healthcare race and socioeconomic status (Papadimos, 2007). When a person does not have good and strong socioeconomic status, it affects an apt insurance status which becomes responsible for affecting health status. For those people who cannot afford a good heath status should be provided with healthcare access that will assist them in having good medical and health care (Papadimos, 2007). The question that arises is that whether access to health care is a privilege or right. I deem that access to health care is not a privilege rather it is a human right (Papadimos, 2007).\nIt can be claimed that access to healthcare should be given freely to every individual. There should not be any obstacle in providing proper health care to every individual (Papadimos, 2007).\nHealthcare Coverage\nThe private sector in the United States plays the major role in providing health care. Accessing the healthcare should be worldwide. Healthcare should be a human right for every individual, and it means that clinics, hospitals, services of doctors and medicines must be available and accessible with good quality for every individual on justifiable basis regardless of the race, caste and religion (http://www.nesri.org). In order to provide convenience to every individual it is necessary that healthcare must be comprehensive and affordable and should be physically accessible when and where it is needed. Sufficient healthcare organization like hospitals, goods like medicines and services must be available geographically and to every community ...\nThe template citationGeneratorTemplate could not be loaded.

Despite the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which pushed the percentage of the U.S. population with access to and enrollment in either private or public sector health insurance to more than 91 percent, affordability remains a crucial barrier to accessing care. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, per capita health spending increased about six-fold in the last half-century, from $1,848 in 1970 to $11,582 in 2019 (adjusted for inflation).\nThis cost is economically unfeasible for everyone — whether insured, uninsured or underinsured. Without access to quality health care at an affordable price, taxpayers pick up the tab for the cost while individuals and communities pay by way of poor health outcomes. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that half of U.S. adults say they or a family member put off or skipped some sort of health care or dental care or relied on an alternative treatment because of the cost, and about one in eight say their medical condition got worse as a result.\n“It's time for us to really accelerate the value equation because, frankly, I don't think we can afford not to as a nation,” said Dr. Adam Myers, senior vice president and chief clinical transformation officer at Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA). “Our health system right now is not particularly sustainable, and we have to move quickly.”\nStrategies to lower the cost of care are critical to ensuring that everyone in the nation receives access to essential health care services, including preventive care and treatment for chronic illnesses.\nTo get a deeper understanding of the link between health care affordability and access and to talk about solutions, we sat down with Myers and other health policy experts about bridging the affordability and access gaps. Here's what they had to say.\nMeet the Experts\nCarrie Cochran-McClain\nChief Policy Officer at National Rural Health Association\n“There needs to be a continued conversation to really look at addressing some of the long-standing systemic disparities that we've seen in our rural communities. And that's going to take solutions that are broader than just focusing on health, but looking at issues around economic development, housing and environmental health.”\nExplore the National Rural Health Association\nDr. Adam Myers\nSenior Vice President and Chief Clinical Transformation Officer\n“Progress is going to take a long-term, sustained effort, one that Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies have been participating in for quite some time, and we're doubling down transitioning towards value-based care, greater affordability and an increased focus on health equity.”\nExplore BCBSA's National Health Equity Strategy\nStacey D. Stewart\nPresident and CEO of March of Dimes\n\"We want policymakers to understand that this is really a fundamental, systemic breakdown in the health care system and the ways in which people access prevention of poor health outcomes and really make sure that they are able to manage their health before they get to the point of disease and severe illness.\"\nExplore March of Dimes\nQUESTION Carol Vassar\nLet's talk about the relationship between health care affordability and health equity. Why are these two concepts inextricably linked, and what role does health care access play?\nANSWERS\nDr. Adam Myers\nIneffective care is the most expensive care. So part of ensuring affordability is ensuring that effective care is prioritized. This includes prioritizing equity as well. If you look within hospitals and health systems, people from underrepresented communities tend to suffer more complications within the health system writ large and have poorer outcomes. Equity affects not just outcomes from a harm perspective and complication standpoint, but also from an affordability standpoint. It is clear that limited access to appropriate care can lead to worse health outcomes and higher costs.\nCarrie Cochran-McClain\nNot having insurance really does translate to less access purely from a cost perspective. But it's also important to realize that a lot of our rural facilities play more of a safety net role than their urban and suburban counterparts. And so, when they have high rates of patients who are unable to pay for their care because of lack of insurance or under insurance, it can make it challenging for those facilities to keep their doors open or keep a full range of service offerings for their patient population, which then translates into further access challenges.\nStacey D. Stewart\nAccess to health care has been a fundamental challenge since the very start of this nation. If we trace our history back to the times of slavery, we all can acknowledge that Black people did not have access to the same kind of care. But as time has evolved, we've continued to see that lack of access for Black Americans, people of color and low-income people generally. That has been a challenge that has complicated and led, in many cases, to that health inequity. But that lack of access is rooted in something else: systemic racism. This country has never been willing to level the playing field to ensure that every person has access to the same level of health care.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield Association: Reducing Racial Disparities in Maternal Health\nWatch on\nA National Strategy Around Racial Disparities\nBCBSA's National Health Equity Strategy will work to improve outcomes that disproportionately affect communities of color.\nLearn How Here\nQUESTION Carol Vassar\nLet's focus on racial health disparities, which clearly are an enormous concern. What is contributing to the many racial disparities, and are there other gaps in the health system that create barriers to health equity?\nANSWERS\nDr. Adam Myers\nWe know numerous conditions disproportionately impact communities of color including behavioral health, diabetes, adverse pregnancy outcomes and cardiovascular disease. But this is more than just health care. Eighty percent of health outcomes are about zip code and the societal structure in which people live rather than their traditional access to care. We have to think about not just how people are receiving care, but what happens in society around them that leads to those poorer health outcomes, and addressing that more broadly is very important for us.\nStacey D. Stewart\nOur health and wellness are determined mainly by how we live, by the health and safety of the communities and environments in which we live, and whether our communities are safe. All of those aspects — of how we live — are called social determinants of health. For many people of color, the additional stresses caused by racial discrimination, not just now, but the kinds of stress and anxiety that have affected us over generations, really show up in overall health and wellness. What we've got to really understand is that we have systemic failures that are going on here.\nQUESTION Carol Vassar\nThere is also a disparity between health outcomes for our nation's rural residents. According to the CDC, rural U.S. residents are more likely to die from heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease and stroke than those living in urban areas. Why?\nANSWERS\nCarrie Cochran-McClain\nBoth structural and individual risk factors are at play here. Maternal mortality is a great place to see how this occurs. We know women and infants living in rural areas have some of the worst morbidity and mortality outcomes in the country. We've seen significant closures of rural hospitals and rural obstetrics units since 2005. When you dig into that, we know that those hospital closures happen in many of the same communities where we have higher rates of people of color, which translates into this intersectionality of race and geographic disparity. When we talk about rural America, it's important that we're talking about the diversity of people who live there. Solutions need to be all-encompassing, looking not only at some of the typical barriers to accessing care but also at issues around structural racism and cultural bias and overcoming those challenges.\nDr. Adam Myers\nThere are 39.8 physicians per 100,000 people in rural areas compared to 53 per 100,000 in urban areas. The life expectancy is lower in these areas as well. You read headlines all the time about rural hospitals closing or them closing significant service lines, like obstetrics units. These closures have a direct impact on access and health outcomes.\nLocalized Solutions to Improve Rural Access\nBCBSA is working to close the care gap in rural America, but it will take organizations with deep community roots and tailored, local solutions. From new pipelines for nurses, to increased access to telemedicine and resources for hospitals, BCBSA and its affiliates are finding and executing solutions that work.\nLearn More Here\nQUESTION Carol Vassar\nThere are no simple solutions when it comes to addressing racial and geographic inequities in health. But are there specific programs or models where you're seeing progress in either of these areas?\nANSWERS\nStacey D. Stewart\nWhen it comes to maternal mortality disparities, doula care has been associated with having improved outcomes for moms and infants. We've seen in studies that doula-supported births for Medicaid-covered moms and mothers of color experience lower rates of low birth weight, fewer preterm births, as well as fewer reports among these women of perceived discrimination within the health care system. Another area where we've made some advances recently under the Biden administration is to make it an option for states to expand Medicaid postpartum 12 months. We've now just had a few states do that. Extending Medicaid postpartum is so important because when you look at maternal mortality, about a third of those deaths happen one week after the baby is born out to one year, and it often happens because women have chronic health, behavioral health or mental health challenges and need to be seen by a provider. Medicaid covers over 40 percent of all births and Medicaid extension is a huge part of the solution.\nDr. Adam Myers\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the desirability, safety and effectiveness of telehealth as a means to access. The same thing goes for remote monitoring. Access to both of these modalities is dependent on access to reliable broadband, which can be quite limited in rural areas and inner-city regions. Expanding broadband access is important from a policy perspective and a societal perspective. We have advocated for lifting telehealth restrictions previously in place, many of which were lifted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our hope is that many will remain lifted and become permanent.\nQUESTION Carol Vassar\nHigh prescription drug costs are also a big piece of this affordability puzzle, with about 18 million Americans — or 7 percent of U.S. adults — unable to pay for at least one prescription medication for their household, according to a 2021 poll from Gallup and West Health. What is being done to address this issue?\nANSWERS\nDr. Adam Myers\nNearly one in three adults do not take their medicines as prescribed because of cost. Generic drugs can cost as much as 95 percent less than brand name drugs. BCBSA works to get the best possible discounts on prescriptions and pass those savings on to patients. We've partnered with Civica Rx to create CivicaScript, focused on bringing generic drugs to the market through retail and mail-order pharmacies in 2022. This is estimated to save hundreds of millions of dollars annually through greater access to generic drugs and could cover about 83 million people nationwide.\nCarrie Cochran-McClain\nFrom a rural perspective, there are existing safety-net programs that we can continue to refine and make better like the 340B drug pricing program which helps to keep doors open for many of our rural facilities, allowing institutions to pass on services and benefits as well as reduce rates for their patient population. The 340B program has faced many challenges in recent years, so we need to work with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that pharmaceutical manufacturers and others are consistent with the program's intention in order to maintain it as a resource.\nA Pathway to Lower Prescription Drug Costs\nTo bring down the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs, Americans need more options. As early as 2022, the inventive partnership CivicaScript will help save patients millions. The new subsidiary, spearheaded by BCBSA and Civica Rx, will manufacture generic prescription drugs for pharmacies across the U.S.\nRead More Here\nQUESTION Carol Vassar\nHow can value-based care options be leveraged to lower health care prices?\nANSWERS\nDr. Adam Myers\nValue-based care changes the reimbursement model from being fee-for-service toward a more sustainable, longitudinal model that promotes a relationship between the patients and their caregivers that is more focused on wellness, prevention and whole-person care. It shares risk between the payers, the providers and sometimes the patients to promote better outcomes and affordability. It's a much more sustainable model. As of 2020, 63 percent of covered BCBS members have access to value-based care. For us to have the sustainable system and outcomes that all Americans deserve and need, expanding these programs is key, not just on the primary care side but on the specialty side, as well.\nCarrie Cochran-McClain\nA real focus on coordination of care can help address overutilization and help improve the quality and efficiency of care. Our small rural facilities must be well connected to their tertiary care counterparts so that we're able to coordinate and follow care from a doctor's office to a critical access hospital to a larger referral hospital. Initiatives like value-based efforts or an Accountable Care Organization model (ACO) allow for better integration and communication when those structures are working well. Many rural communities have been systematically and generationally underfunded through inadvertent application of policy at all levels. When value-based programs move to address social determinants of health and vulnerable populations, it may take years to see the cost savings. We need to rethink timeframes involved in calculating prices and consider linking financial risk related to performance to factors such as increased access or improved quality.\nQUESTION Carol Vassar\nThe issues of affordability, equity and accessibility require collaboration across the private market, existing public-private partnerships and more. How do we bring these stakeholders together in conversation?\nANSWERS\nStacey D. Stewart\nWe have to get every single sector around the table. I think a lot of people, when they hear these issues of things like maternal infant health, they think, oh, that's just about women who are pregnant and babies, but the fact of the matter is that this is about family health. We did a study some years ago looking at the overall cost in this country of premature birth annually, and we calculated that it costs the nation about $26 billion to have the level of premature birth that we have in this country today, where one in ten babies are born too soon. These are real hard costs that employers, community leaders, and elected officials need to pay attention to because they have a real bottom-line cost to families and communities.\nCarrie Cochran-McClain\nWe have found great collaborators in some of our \"non-traditional\" partners who are part of the health care conversation, like employers who have a strong investment in making sure that they've got a healthy workforce. Similarly, foundations can be good allies and advocates interested in moving the needle and willing to do pilot testing of innovations or different models of care. We also think about how we are engaging the patient population and their communities as a critical voice in how to innovate the delivery system.\nDr. Adam Myers\nBCBSA is committed to collaborating with key stakeholders to find shared solutions. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic BCBSA and all 35 BCBS companies leaned into the power of bringing stakeholders together as we worked with government, industry and local leaders on equitable access to vaccines. We are collaborating to advance our goal of drastically reducing maternal health disparities by expanding partnerships, advocating for policies and exploring incentives for culturally appropriate interventions so all patients have a positive care experience. We have to bring everyone across the health care system to the table to create lasting change and hold ourselves accountable.", "A Right or a Privilege? How to Practically and Ethically Reconcile Two Opposing Views of Health Care - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics\nA Right or a Privilege? How to Practically and Ethically Reconcile Two Opposing Views of Health Care\nCharles E. Binkley, MD\nCharles Binkley (@CharlesBinkley) is the director of Bioethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. Views are his own.\nThe unsettled debate in our country over whether health care is a right or a privilege is almost certainly at the heart of why our health care system is one of the costliest in the world, and also one of the worst in terms of quality and outcomes, ranking last among peer countries. President Trump has been explicit about his belief that health care is a privilege and should not be given to those who cannot or do not earn or pay for it. His administration has made this conviction clear with its numerous attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nIn contrast, President-elect Biden has been equally clear in his belief that health care is a right and not a privilege. He is not alone in this conviction. Article 25 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights lists medical care as a basic human right. In addition, Pope Francis has spoken out that health care is not “a consumer good, but rather a universal right.”\nSo, what is at the root of this fundamental difference over health care? Are those who believe that health care is a privilege willing to stand by and watch other humans suffer and die just because those suffering cannot afford medical care? Most agree that humans have a basic moral responsibility to save other humans from suffering and death, but the question is always, “At what cost?”\nShould we help a drowning person?\nTake the example of the drowning person. A woman walks by and sees a man drowning in a shallow lake. Entering the lake and assisting the man would mean that she gets wet, gets her clothes dirty, and makes her late for work. Not helping the drowning man would mean that he suffers and dies. But what if the lake is frozen and the ice is fragile? What if the lake is deep and the woman can’t swim? The moral question is how much personal burden are we willing to accept in order to end another human’s suffering and save their life?\nThose who believe that heath care is a privilege would say none, or at most very, very little. Those who believe that health care is a right would say that society should shoulder some degree of burden in order to alleviate the suffering and preserve the lives of others. Therefore, the debate over whether health care is a right or a privilege really comes down to how much burden society is willing to accept in order to provide health care to those who lack it. Put in practical terms: are those with money willing to give part of their money to those who don’t have money in order to alleviate their suffering and prevent their death?\nHow to reconcile right and privilege\nHow can these two radically different views of health care ever be reconciled? There may be a way.\nMarkkula Center for Applied Ethics Board Chair Dick Levy and I recently proposed a model of health care that is practical, ethical, and satisfies both those who believe health care is a right, and those who believe it is a privilege.\nIt works like this. By eliminating spending on health care that has never been shown to improve human health and wellness, that money can be used to extend to everyone health care that has been shown to improve human health and wellness. Interventions, treatments, and medications that have been shown to improve human health are often called “high-value care” whereas those that have not are called “low-value care.”\nLet me give an example. One classic is a procedure called knee arthroscopy. This procedure can be used to treat many conditions, one of which is to treat arthritis of the knee. The procedure involves making a few incisions on the knee, placing a camera into the joint, and “cleaning” out debris. It’s an outpatient procedure with minimal pain and a short recovery. What makes this straightforward procedure “low value?” It just doesn’t provide any benefit to patients with osteoarthritis. There is no improvement in joint movement, no decrease in pain, nor improvement in function after the procedure. And it’s expensive. The two largest drivers of health care costs are physicians and hospitals. Who makes money off of knee arthroscopy? Physicians and hospitals.\nBy eliminating low-value care and using the money saved to pay for high-value care, the same amount of money could pay for more people to receive health care. What’s more, there would be no greater cost to those who believe health care is a privilege. What about those who want to have a knee arthroscopy for osteoarthritis, even if it doesn’t decrease pain or improve movement or function? If you can pay out of pocket for the procedure and can find a physician and hospital willing to perform it, then go for it. However, don’t take money from high-value interventions such as childhood vaccinations, mammograms, and diabetes management to pay for an arthroscopy that doesn’t make any difference in overall health.\nThis hybrid approach is likely the best that can be done to reconcile these two differing views of health care. Ethics is full of trade-offs wherein each party gives up something and gains something. The “rights camp” would get health care coverage for everyone and the “privilege camp” would not have to spend any more money for procedures that improve health.\nIn the end, needless human suffering and death would be dramatically reduced. That is a moral value which everyone can agree on.\nDec 7, 2020", "On Achieving Access and Equity in Health Care - PMC\nSkip to main content\nLog in\nNCBI Homepage\nSearch\nAdvanced Search\nUser Guide\nJournal List\nMilbank Q\nv.83(4); 2005 Dec\nPMC2690282\nMilbank Q. 2005 Dec; 83(4): 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2005.00427.x.\ndoi: 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2005.00427.x\nPMCID: PMC2690282\nOn Achieving Access and Equity in Health Care\nRashi Fein\nCopyright and License information Disclaimer\nThis is a reprint of   in  volume 50 on page 157.\nThis paper addresses some of the issues related to health care in the United States. In so doing, I give primary emphasis to questions involving access to health care. Even so, I limit the discussion of any particular topic to its most important facets. The principle of selection involves various criteria: insofar as possible, I discuss those issues that are important at a system level (particularly as they impinge on the allocation of resources), that involve economic arrangements influencing behavior and performance, and that can be illuminated by the economist's perspective. I attempt to give primary emphasis to those variables whose influence is far ranging.\nIn so doing, of course, we cannot examine every network of interrelations. Although this simplifies the discussion, we pay a price for incompleteness. There is little choice, however. One of the difficulties with the health field stems from the fact that everything is interrelated: that intervention on one front has “side effects” on other fronts; that intervention designed to accomplish one purpose sometimes fails to do so because other factors that appear unrelated are not changed. To discuss everything is impossible. On the other hand, to say nothing because we cannot discuss everything is irresponsible.\nFinally, we will have to reach judgments even in spite of the relative weakness of the data available for analysis. We know far less, for example, about the availability of services (particularly if corrected for quality differentials) than we would like to. So, too, with the impact of differences in utilization on levels of health. The current refrain often seems to be, “But we have no output measures.” That, regrettably, is frequently the case. Nevertheless, just as we cannot be silent because of the complexity of intertwined relations, neither can we be silent because of insufficiency of data. We can use experience and judgment to arrive at (tentative) conclusions. Not knowing everything does not mean we know nothing.\nGo to:\nAccess and Equity: Financial Considerations\nWhy Be Concerned about Equity?\nThe first question we address is, “Why is so much attention devoted to the health sector; why all the fuss about equity?” This issue is often raised by those who regard health as important, but who believe the relation is very weak between medical care expenditures and services (inputs) and health (outputs). They argue that monies that might go to the health sector to achieve equity might be better spent in other areas—e.g., housing, nutrition, education—even if the goal that is being sought is better health. All of us have heard the analysts who question the value of increasing the availability of health resources or services. We have heard distinguished leaders of medicine note that most disease is self limiting and that in a high proportion of cases physicians cannot intervene effectively. 1\nSome remarks are in order on the question of the importance of medical services. I do not intend to review the evidence on whether medical services make a difference (and to what degree) to the health of a population. Rather, I propose to consider the significance of the fact that the public believes the services to be important and, therefore, desires a greater equity in their distribution.\nIn the case of health and medical care, we are dealing with a sector in which, because of customs and folkways, image may be even more important than reality. Because some (even if relatively little) medical care deals with matters of life and death, because of fear, because of infatuation with science and technology—as well as because medicine oftentimes does help some individuals and, therefore, each individual can hope that it will help him—persons have come to believe that medical care services and intervention by the physician make significant contributions to health. This view is not likely to change.\nIt is quite likely that public policies will reflect what the public believes to be the case even if analysts find little evidence to support the public view. Part of the reason that policy will respond to public belief relates to the attitudes that surround questions of health and of life and death. Part of the reason relates to the different perspectives of the public and the analyst. This difference in perspective, and in criteria used in decision making, lies at the heart of some of the major difficulties in allocating resources to the health sector.\nThe analyst is likely to examine issues—e.g., the impact of medical care on health—in terms of group phenomena. He is interested in a rate of return, in what happens on the average. The citizen—importantly, the provider as well as the consumer—is far more interested in the individual case. His behavior is responsive to the fact that intervention can make a difference in one case rather than to the fact that it makes a difference in only one per cent of the cases. If each individual believes or hopes that he may be the one who will benefit and if we do not know who the one will be and, therefore, require that the service be available to all who might benefit, we have a situation made for conflict. The analyst may say that only one per cent of the cases will benefit. The physician (trained to think in terms of the individual patient) and the patient (for obvious reasons) will focus on the fact that in one per cent of the cases there will be a benefit. Neither will want to be denied the resources needed for the particular case at hand. That case, after all, may be the one in a hundred.\nThis, I believe, is one of the basic difficulties in formulating and administering public policy in the field of health care. We reject market mechanisms that might allocate resources to and within the health sector, in part, because market results are at variance with our values. We say “medical care is a right” because we do not believe medical care should be rationed in terms of income. As a consequence, we need to develop other allocative and rationing mechanisms. Often these alternative processes will involve government regulation and program development. Government, however, will find it difficult to limit the resources allocated to the health sector and thus, in effect, to ration services. 2 In making public policy, provider and consumer attitudes (concern about the individual) weigh against the analyst's benefit-cost ratios (reflecting concern about populations). 3\nFurthermore, when the consumer hears the analyst say that, in the light of the rate of return, we need not devote additional resources to the health sector (or to particular parts of it) he recognizes that the constraint on resources implies rationing. Existing American health care financing mechanisms provide little assurance that the rationing mechanism will not be income related. Medical care, of course, is rationed in other economies and under other health care financing mechanisms: when central government allocates a given amount of resources to the health sector and when this amount is less than either consumer or provider could or would like to utilize, some “rationing” will take place. The issue, therefore, is not rationing itself, but the nature of the rationing process. Are the rationing decisions related to income or to medical needs or priorities? 4 Thus, groups who today receive less than what they consider their fair share of services are hardly likely to be impressed by an argument that they translate: “Some people do get more of certain services, but after all the services don't—on the average—yield high benefits (relative to their costs). Therefore, though the rich may ‘waste’ their money in purchasing the services, we shall not invest government funds to increase the availability of the services. The poor should not be distressed—they are not being denied things of considerable value.”\nIn recent years, much of what has been said about medical services could have been so translated. This, however, means maintaining the status quo. It is not surprising that the translation is not likely to find favor among those whom the status quo has not served relatively well.\nFor these (and other) reasons, arguments that equity is not that important will not find favor among the general public. Most consumers will remain more concerned about distributional equity in the provision of health services than about equity considerations in the provision of most other goods and services. They will behave as if medical services do count for more and public policy will respond to their concerns. 5\nThe issues raised in the above discussion are important in considering public policy. Should government allocate resources as the public might prefer, even if those resources will not accomplish that which the public desires? What, for example, is the proper mix for an antipoverty program, that which the analyst feels will eliminate poverty or that which the poor value highly? The two are not always the same. We avoid these important issues by suggesting that if government cannot “educate” the consumer or beneficiary it will have to respond to his images, tastes, values and beliefs.\nWhat is the present situation in regard to equity in access to care? There are two parts to this question: the financial constraints and the delivery system performance. We shall need to examine both for we cannot assume that solving the problem associated with financing care would make services available, nor can we assume that increasing the supply of services would enable persons to purchase them. Let us begin with the easier part: the financial barrier. I use the term “easier” because restructuring the financing of health care is, in many ways, easier to achieve than is a restructuring of the delivery system. The fact that we are debating national health insurance (NHI) rather than a national health service (NHS) is not a coincidence.\nWhy Provide Specific Financing for Health Services?\nSurely we need not belabor the point that financial barriers to health care exist in the United States. Little would be gained by once again citing the data that all of us already know. Prepayment and voluntary health insurance, largely the result of labor-management agreements, have reduced the financial barrier for many, but not for all Americans. Medicare, Medicaid and a variety of categorical programs addressed to particular population groups or to particular diseases have also helped. Yet, even so, financial problems remain. These are of two kinds: (1) the ability to pay for care, (2) the impact of payment on family income and assets.\nIn this connection, it is useful to remind ourselves of some of the history of the Medicare debate. That legislation was justified on the basis of two arguments. The first derived from the fact that many persons, ages 65 and over, were unable to obtain an appropriate amount of health care because they lacked the financial resources to purchase the care. The second justification was that, even though individuals might be able to pay for care, their financial resources were so limited that the care would cut heavily into their discretionary income. 6 Thus, the debate related both to the financial ability to pay for the care that was needed and to the impact of large and unpredictable medical expenses on the financial status of the aged.\nIn a situation that has the characteristics of a lottery in which some will be heavy losers, there will be great concern about developing insurance safeguards. That concern is undoubtedly increased by the fact that the lower the individual's income, the greater the losses as a percentage of that income.\nIn some cases, the lack of money to pay for medical care (given required expenditures on housing, clothing and food) will prevent people from seeking care. In other cases, the monetary conditions result in a psychological barrier: individuals will postpone seeking care in the hope of avoiding an expenditure that would be large in relation to disposable income. In still other cases, persons may seek and pay for care but with a significant impact on their discretionary income.\nIt is necessary to distinguish between these different situations if we are to develop a public policy designed to meet the various financial problems. If I am correct, the public is concerned not only about the impact of the income distribution on the utilization of medical care, but also about the impact of the utilization of and expenditures on care on the income distribution itself. It is the second problem that calls for specific financing programs for health services rather than the provision of money to achieve a more equal distribution of pre-illness income.\nWere we dealing with a category other than health care, it would not be as clear that the financing or provision of the specific good or service would be necessary. Outside of the health care sector, for example, it is often argued that an income distribution problem can (and should) be met by the provision of money. 7 This would permit the consumer to determine whether he chooses to spend those funds on the product that others had in mind or on some other product that he prefers. It is sometimes suggested that these considerations should also guide us in relation to health care, and that government should not provide assistance for specified services or support specifically for health expenditures. Instead government should provide individuals with money that they could use to purchase care (or insurance), but that they could also use for other goods and services if they so preferred.\nIf, however, our concern is the ex post income distribution, it is not sufficient to provide ex ante income (valuable as that may be) inasmuch as the sick would “lose” the money and the well would retain it. A solution to the various problems requires that health services, like education, be provided free. 8 Even if we cannot eliminate the “lottery” that causes some to be ill and others well, we can eliminate some of the monetary losses associated with the lottery.\nThere are additional reasons for the view that targeted dollars are required: (1) There is evidence that taxpayers prefer to support programs not people. The categorical, targeted legislation fares better than does the broad and all inclusive. Cancer support would fare better than national health insurance; the latter better than general income maintenance. Taxpayers want to retain a measure of control over the uses to which their dollars are put. (2) Unless funds are channeled through a single payment mechanism, it is difficult to achieve important changes in the health delivery system. (3) In the absence of government intervention, private expenditures on health care may be sub-optimal because of “externalities;” i.e., my well-being is affected by the next person's state of health (and the next person does not consider that when he determines his health expenditures).\nSome Equity-Equality Issues\nWhat is meant by equity in the provision of health services? Were we speaking of tax matters and of dollars rather than services, the criteria would be simpler. In the health field a consensus on definitions is sorely lacking, in part because we have failed to specify objectives and the criteria by which to measure their attainment. Is our concern solely with the health producing aspects of the service or do we care—and if so, how much—about the amenities and the conditions under which the money or service is provided? What is the relation between equity and equality? Is equity realized when equal numbers of dollars (or services) are available for the health care of different persons, or when equal numbers of dollars (or services) are utilized, or when equal health outcomes are achieved?\nAs can be seen, the issues we discuss are not unique to the health sector. In different forms they are found in other sectors. The fact that they have not been solved adequately in other sectors can give us little comfort. Yet, we can gain some useful perspective from the experience elsewhere. In the field of education, for example, we find similar problems—and this in spite of the fact that in many important respects the educational sector is easier to understand than is the health sector. In the early 1960s, the definition of equality in education related to per pupil expenditures. Though we have not achieved even that limited goal, our definitions have changed and become broader. From a criterion of equality in dollar inputs, we moved to a definition of equality in terms of outcomes. At present, it is argued that there should be inequality in dollar inputs per student; inequalities that compensate for the dispersion of advantages and disadvantages that, in turn, make for variation in output per dollar of input and in outcomes. As they have in education, the newer definitions of equality will overtake the health field.\nIn education, we are still groping for answers to problems associated with equity and equality, with “basics” and “extras,” in the public sector. Recent court decisions will help in the search for answers, but the achievement of equality at a basic minimum level is only one part of the problem. How do we deal with the fact that some persons will be able to purchase even more services than the basic minimum, that some communities will be willing and able to do more? If a community has no public kindergarten should we (can we) deny some individuals the opportunity to organize and finance their own kindergarten, i.e., to have a private kindergarten? If the school system does not provide librarians for all schools (and chooses, therefore, not to supply them to any) should we deny some (generally, upper income) mothers the right to volunteer their services as librarians in their school? The difficulty in saying “no” is clear. The implications of saying “yes” should be equally clear.\nThe battle of equity and equality has not yet been fought in the field of health in the United States. One can predict that, at some point in the future, it will be fought. If society, looking at the benefits to society, should decide not to provide various health services to the population, will it permit individuals who want those services and can afford to purchase them in the private market to do so? What if those services involve matters of life and death? If society were to conclude that it would not finance kidney dialysis for all who need it, will it finance it for some (and, if so, how will it select the “some”)? Will it permit individuals who have the resources to finance the service privately? If society should decide that it will not invest significant resources in keeping individuals alive in the latter stages of a terminal illness, will it allow the individual who has the resources to do so?\nNor is this a problem that exists only in the case of exotic and expensive procedures. It should not surprise us that in today's market, a blend of the public and the private, similar issues arise in Medicare. If a physician, more highly qualified and providing a higher quality of medical care, charges more than the prevailing and customary charge in the community, the patient must pay the difference. This can be interpreted to mean that the Medicare program is prepared to pay for an average level of physician competence for all individuals while permitting individuals interested in a higher quality of care, and who can pay for that higher quality, to seek it out. Even though Medicare does, therefore, bring an adequate or average quality of service to all, it does not bring equality. It is clear that it does not provide what public officials often set as a goal: the highest quality for all. With limited resources one cannot have the highest quality for all. If the quest is for equality, the slogan might well be: the highest quality for none. That, however, is hardly a slogan that will find its way into a Presidential message (in part because it is not of such slogans that Presidents are made).\nIt is not clear, of course, that the objective is full equality. It may be that a more limited objective—say the elimination of income as a rationing device—is sought. With scarce resources, society may decide not to withhold services from everyone because it cannot provide services to all, but instead to provide them to some who are selected on a basis other than their ability to pay for the services. Tables of random numbers or other criteria could be used to determine the allocation of the scarce resources.\nThough I have raised these issues because it seems to me that, at some point, the body politic will wrestle in some continuing fashion with many of them, we should not be misled. The fact that there is no consensus on these matters and that they cannot all be solved does not imply that we cannot move forward. We are not required to have a solution to every possible dilemma before we develop a public policy to resolve those that we can do something about.\nIn considering equity, we can adapt some of the approaches used in discussions of tax equity. We can distinguish between horizontal and vertical equity. By horizontal equity we mean that the health care system shall provide essentially the same set of health services (or a distribution of services that equalize outcomes) for persons in approximately the same economic circumstances. Most often horizontal equity considerations are assumed to relate to questions of access affected by the availability of services (e.g., rural-urban differences). These, of course, are important. Horizontal equity, however, is also affected by the nature of government support for the purchase of health services. If such support, as in the Medicaid program, leaves the states free to determine eligibility and the level of benefits (i.e., if the system is based on matching grants rather than on 100 per cent federal funding) horizontal equity will not be achieved. Indeed, the existing inequities are likely to be compounded. The achievement of vertical equity requires government involvement in the financing of care. The achievement of horizontal equity requires that it be the federal level of government. This is not surprising for horizontal equity requires that the residents of different states be treated in like fashion (i.e., as Americans). Only the federal dollar can insure that that occurs. 9\nVertical equity, “fairness,” in the provision of services for persons in different economic circumstances, is more difficult to define. Because health benefits must be financed, an examination of the progressivity of the distributional impact must consider the distribution of the tax, premium or other device that finances the benefits as well as the distribution of the benefits themselves (the availability and distribution of the services). It must also consider the proportion of health care costs that is covered by the program. We achieve relatively little even if we devise a highly progressive tax structure, but one that finances services that play only a small part in the consumer's budget. If our goal is equity in the distribution of health expenditures, we must consider the distribution of total health care costs in relation to income.\nPaying for Medical Care: Present Patterns\nAt the present time, the individual's medical care costs are often met both by out-of-pocket expenditures and by voluntary health insurance benefits. Out-of-pocket expenditures occur because voluntary health insurance coverage usually involves deductibles and co-insurance, is not comprehensive in its scope and sets upper limits on benefits. This approach has a long tradition and has found its way into public programs, e.g., Medicare.\nDeductibles and co-insurance are supported on two rationales. The first is that the larger the amount the individual must pay on an out-of-pocket basis, the smaller the premium charge (or tax) can be. The second rationale is based, if not on empirical analysis of the demand for health care, on well-established economic principles. It is assumed that if the individual is required to share in the cost of care at the time that the care is sought his utilization of care will be reduced. In the absence of deductibles and co-insurance, care is “free.” At that zero price the individual would seek more care than if he were required to pay a small sum, sufficient to deter him from seeking unnecessary care, but insufficient to deter him from seeking care when it is required. This second rationale is closely associated with yet another that is put forward: if the consumer is required to pay a share of the cost, he will be more cost conscious than would otherwise be the case. This cost consciousness, in turn, will induce providers of care, including hospitals, to exercise price restraint and to compete on a price basis.\nAlthough these arguments carry some weight, it is possible to advance arguments on the other side of the co-insurance and deductible issue. It is clear, for example, that a fixed deductible and a fixed percentage co-insurance cannot hit with equal impact on families in different income brackets. The amount that is appropriate for one family (i.e., it deters only unnecessary medical care) may be trivial for another (serving not to deter at all) and too large for yet another (serving to deter even important care). It is true that, in theory, this particular objection can be met by letting the size of the deductible or the per cent of co-insurance vary with the income of the family. Yet, deductibles and co-insurance may entail significant administrative costs and the more refined the approach, the greater the costs of administration. Nor do we have the requisite information to construct a sliding scale that would have the particular impacts we desire. One must, therefore, ask whether the claimed benefits of deductibles and coinsurance are sufficient to justify the costs.\nWe have little information concerning the degree to which utilization would be affected by different co-insurance and deductibles. 10 We also lack information that would enable us to assess whether an increase in utilization is unwarranted. Costs of travel and waiting time, possible loss of income from work, fear, concern and so forth, all associated with visiting the physician, may lead persons to underutilize medical care services. If utilization should be higher—even then it would be at a zero price—one would not want to erect a financial deterrent.\nWe can also indicate some doubt concerning the effectiveness of deductibles and co-insurance as cost-control devices. Even in spite of existing financial barriers, the health sector has not had an enviable cost-control record. Furthermore, though we know relatively little about how prices and expenditures are determined in the marketplace, what we do know suggests that the physician is the critical actor in the determination both of unit costs (the price of the product) and total cost (unit cost times quantity, the degree to which the product is utilized). The largest savings on the expenditure side are likely to come as ways are found to affect utilization (rather than price). Since utilization is largely physician (not patient) determined, efforts to contain the total costs of a program require that the programs be structured to provide incentives to change physician behavior. 11 Deductibles and co-insurance (at levels that do not deter necessary care) are not likely to do that.\nCosts associated with treatment for conditions not covered through the insurance mechanism are also part of out-of-pocket expenditures. The failure of insurance to be comprehensive in scope has taught us that the medical care system can be distorted by virtue of what is and what is not covered through insurance. Economics does make a difference. In theory, such distortions could be for good or for bad. One could, presumably, structure a health insurance program so as to reduce unnecessary and expensive procedures. It would, however, be difficult to leave the most expensive procedures without coverage. Even though, for example, some may overutilize expensive hospital procedures, others utilize the services because they need them. Shall they be uninsured?\nAs contrasted with other types of insurance, our problem is compounded by the fact that the provider and consumer help determine whether the insured service is utilized. If some services are insured and others are not we are likely to find distortions in utilization. Because we are called on to insure expensive procedures, we are providing incentives for their use. One is, therefore, almost inevitably led to comprehensiveness of coverage, in part for medical reasons, in part to prevent unfavorable impacts on the allocation of resources within the medical system and in part to achieve the equity we spoke of earlier.\nThere is a third element of medical care that is paid for by the patient on an out-of-pocket basis: those costs that occur after the insurance has reached the upper limits on the number of days of hospital care or on the total cost that will be covered. In many ways this is the anomaly in the insurance field. Had health insurance not originally been developed by the hospital sector as a way of protecting itself from bad debts, we would likely have had larger deductibles and greater protection at the upper end. Since most patients spend a limited amount of time in the hospital, the emphasis, however, was on shallow-end coverage. The consequence—incorporated into federal legislation in the Medicare program and duplicated in a variety of proposals that have been offered to the Congress—is that those who stay in the hospital the longest time (and who often are most sick) run out of benefits. Insurance, in general, tries to protect against high expenses that occur relatively infrequently and the occurrence of which is not under the control of the person having the insurance, but that upper-end coverage is lacking. The costs associated with exceeding the upper limits may not significantly affect the distribution of medical care costs by income class (because the upper limits are seldom reached). Nonetheless, the costs are a severe problem for those who must bear them and require relief.\nPaying for Medical Care: Future Possibilities\nIn my view, a comprehensive insurance program is called for with coverage at both the upper end of the cost spectrum (if high-cost services are to be available) and at the low end (there is little evidence that deductibles and co-insurance yield important benefits). I refer to coverage both at the upper end and at the lower end, so I could, of course, be asked about my trade-offs: would I rather have the one or the other? If the question assumes that, for political reasons, we cannot have both upper- and lower-end coverage, it is meaningful to pose the issue. This is not the case, however, if the question assumes that we can afford one or the other, but not both. Costs are incurred whether or not they are covered by a national program. We are not talking about new dollars (except to the extent that utilization is increased, and that increase may be one of the desirable consequences of the program). In largest measure we are talking about old dollars in new clothes. The question is how shall the cost be borne; i.e., shall the expenditures for medical care be private or public?\nFor the legislator, the trade-off question is meaningful. Legislative bodies are concerned about increasing taxes even if these taxes pay for services that would otherwise be paid for by private expenditures. Part of the dilemma of the legislator is the result of the fact that he has failed to educate the public as to what the issues are. Education is never easy, and the task is made even more difficult by the cynicism and mistrust that is the legacy of our recent past. Yet, it is a task that cannot be avoided except at the risk of creating more mistrust.\nQuite often, the difficulty in explaining what the public might receive for its taxes lies in the fact that expenditure programs are not tied to specific tax revenues. This is one of the strengths of our fiscal system. It permits the Legislative Branch to choose between programs (presumably) to maximize welfare. Nonetheless, the absence of a link, at least in the consumer's mind, does make it more difficult to associate particular benefits with the general taxes that we pay. These considerations are relevant in examining the method by which funds might be raised for a program that would distribute the costs of medical care more equitably.\nThe most progressive part of our tax system is the federal personal income tax. Given a progressivity goal, one could, therefore, argue in favor of financing a national health insurance program out of general revenues, in large part, derived from the federal personal income tax. Furthermore, appropriations from general revenues increase the competition between dollars for health and for other programs. This can have a significant and desirable effect on the Congressional desire to control costs. Arguing against the use of general revenues to support the program is the lack of a visible link, as seen by the taxpayer, between the tax and the program. Such a link might increase the public's understanding that public dollars for health compete with private expenditures and, thus, would be useful in generating consumer concern about cost control. It is possible, therefore, to argue that general taxation increases Congressional concern about prices and costs, whereas the levying of a special payroll tax increases the consumer's concern. If it is necessary that all parties understand that there is no such thing as a free lunch, it may be desirable to use both types of taxation in funding a national health insurance program.\nThe payroll tax, in its present form, however, is hardly a tax that can be considered progressive. Its deficiencies are well known: e.g., it does not take account of family size, often discriminates against multiple-earner families, considers only certain kinds of income. It is proportional up to the wage base and then regressive. Raising the wage base would help, but other adjustments are also desirable: e.g., low-income families could be given a refund for the payroll tax deducted. Over the last decade we have had a number of personal income tax cuts even in spite of the social needs pressing upon the nation. The nonprogressive payroll tax has, therefore, come to have an even larger impact on the tax burden by family income. Today a family of four earning $4,000 pays $32 in federal income tax. Yet it pays over $400 in payroll taxes (if we include the employer's contribution). If income tax rates reflect our judgments about the tax levels that are fair or appropriate at the various income levels or about the relative tax burden by family income, we can hardly add a very substantial payroll tax and assume that we are not distorting the very standards that we have set.\nThe payroll tax does have important political strengths. It is to be hoped, however, that we would not embark on payroll taxation as the method of financing national health insurance with the belief that a few years later we could amend the payroll tax to improve it. Such amendments will not come easily. The time to press for a more equitable payroll tax is before the program is enacted.\nEarlier we have discussed the importance of cost control. Although indicating that it would be useful for the consumer to recognize the link between costs of the program and tax levels, one can hardly expect that the individual will be influenced in his utilization of medical care services by such considerations. This is the case for two reasons: first, because no individual believes that his utilization will affect the general price level, the total utilization and the tax rate. Little personal gain is to be derived from acting in a socially responsible fashion. Second, decisions regarding utilization are more often made by the physician rather than by the patient. Consumer awareness about costs should be increased. Ultimately, however, costs will depend on how the system is structured and on physician behavior. We must, therefore, now turn to those things within the system that can affect the physician in his determination of appropriate utilization.\nWe are also compelled to turn to the question of system because the financing of services is only one part of the equity consideration. We cannot assume that if financial barriers are removed, the distribution problem would be solved through market adjustments—as might, for example, be the case with food. To assure a more equitable distribution of food is relatively simple (conceptually, if not politically). In general we need only provide families with sufficient money (or with food stamps, if we want to reduce the possibility that the “currency” provided would be used for nonfood purchases). We are not required to open grocery stores. We can assume that a food distribution network exists or will expand to meet consumer demand. The level of skill demanded of grocery store managers does not necessitate a long lead time to train supply (surely not as long as that required to educate and train physicians). Nor, in contrast with physicians, would we have to attract managers to the Ozarks from New York. In the case of health services the situation is quite different—and particularly so in a system as highly fragmented as ours. Access to health services requires that health resources be available (not simply that the “health stamp” be distributed to families). Physicians are people, not commodities. They prefer certain locations, certain kinds of situations, certain types of associations. Under those conditions, providing equal access (however we choose to define it) requires that we address the delivery system's characteristics. We thus turn our attention to some of the issues related to the allocation of resources to and within the health care system.\nGo to:\nAccess and Equity: System Change\nThe health system is a complex network many parts of which we do not fully understand. In the search for equity we must consider that system and the allocation of resources within it for access is, in part, determined by the allocation of resources. That the system suffers from a variety of ailments in its resource allocation is clear. What is unclear is which of the problems are interrelated and to what degree. We are, therefore, often at a loss to understand the nature of the required therapy. Too often we tend to approach each ailment or misallocation as if it requires direct action and intervention. Seldom do we explore the possibilities that actions on another part of the system may, in an indirect manner, affect the variable that is our concern.\nThe bias in favor of direct intervention is clear. It seems simpler to attack a problem in a frontal fashion. The disadvantages should also be clear. Too often the problem we see is really a manifestation of more basic difficulties and is the logical consequence of a more basic structural deficiency. It may, therefore, resist intervention, recur again or require periodic intervention as it manifests itself in some new manner.\nTo suggest that one knows the single root cause of our difficulties and that that cause can be described in specific terms would be foolish. Nor is it even clear that there is one single cause to all our problems. Actions on a number of fronts are required, though little in the American tradition suggests that, even if we had the understanding, a rational and organized approach would be followed. We are far more likely to move in fits and starts, first in one area then in another. Nonetheless, it is useful to recognize the interrelations within the system. At the margin this knowledge can affect our public policies. It can prevent us from dissipating energy on policies that would have little impact, could enable us to devote our effort to actions that have basic effects, could keep us from taking an action in one area that negates what we are doing elsewhere in the system. It should be clear that as we examine basic problems and discuss them in more specific terms than “what we need is a reorganization of the delivery system,” we cannot help but be controversial. The existing system has its rewards for many providers and consumers. It is hardly to be expected in a field as important to the consumer and as rewarding to the producer as is medicine, that important changes will be welcomed by everyone. At the minimum there is the fear of the unknown. At the maximum there is the recognition that the particular individual may not gain through change.\nThe fact that controversy is present means that the health sector is politicized, a phenomenon not to be deplored but welcomed. No longer can the sector be viewed as belonging solely to the “experts.” What is to be deplored is that many first-class analysts have played the role of second-class politicians. Desirous of change and improvement, they have presented analyses and recommendations that are far reaching but that stay within the limits of what they conceive of as political reality, within their definition of what is possible. This is regrettable, on at least two grounds. The quest for political acceptability has tended to focus the discussion on technical matters, as if there were no ideology. As a result, the most important areas of controversy, the ones that require debate and on which people disagree, have been neglected. The effort to “sell” a program steers one to the technical nonideological issues and replaces passion with blandness. This lowers the quality of the discussion and does less than is required for the education of the public. In addition, there is little to suggest that the political analysis is necessarily correct. Too often the analyst, in playing politician, rejects proposals that have greater political viability than he imagines. Although it is true that one can offer proposals so politically unrealistic that the advocate as well as the proposal is rejected, that danger, it seems to me, should be considered important only in the center of the political arena; i.e., on the Washington scene. The problem, perhaps, is that too high a proportion of those concerned with American medicine are (imagine themselves to be or hope to be) directly or indirectly part of the Washington scene.\nWe need only remind ourselves of Phases I and II, to recognize that one can underestimate what is possible. Similar examples exist in other areas. Before the health analyst rejects a proposal as politically unrealistic he might ask whether it is more “daring” than a trip to China, a proposal to impose a moratorium on a category of court decisions, a budget deficit of over $25 billion. Surely, asking that question will suggest that one need not be inhibited about being “far out” in his suggestions.\nRegulation and the Market\nWhat are some of the more basic elements of the health care system that would benefit from change? What organizational and financing structures have influences so pervasive that changing them might result in fundamental changes in the allocation of resources and, therefore, in access?\nMany of our difficulties in the health sector relate to the fact that we operate in a never-never land, somewhere between the free market and the results it might bring and government regulation and its consequences. Rejecting the market because the characteristics of health care suggest that market results would not meet our preferences, rejecting tight government regulation because of American traditions and the difficulties inherent in the regulatory process, we have found ourselves in an untenable situation. Our difficulties will not disappear; indeed, they could grow even more severe with the enactment of measures limited to the financing of the purchase of health services. Many persons would be aided by such legislation, but unless these programs (or accompanying legislation) address some of the issues that affect the delivery of services, we will provide a good deal less health or equity than we should with the resources available. This, after all, has been the record of Medicare and Medicaid. To suggest, as some do, that these programs have only caused inflation is fallacious. They have offered financial protection to many and have provided additional services to some. Nevertheless, it is also true that while helping to solve some problems, they have contributed to the worsening of others. In my view their pluses far outweigh their minuses. Nonetheless, it is clear there have been minuses. Furthermore, they have, unfortunately, led to a certain disillusionment.\nDuring the decade of the 1960s—in the days of the optimism of the New Frontier and the Great Society—we enacted a wide variety of social programs in a number of areas. The characteristic of many of these programs was that the federal government appropriated funds with which to buy goods and services from the private sector. It did not produce the goods or services itself, nor did it take over the control of the particular sector. Medicare and Medicaid are examples of this approach, but the examples extend beyond the field of health. The programs were underfunded and, in some cases, poorly managed, but those were not the only difficulties they faced. Watching dollars flow out of Washington and observing that the dollars would not change delivery systems (an observation that should not have come as a surprise) many who believed in the aims of the legislation gave up hope too quickly and began to consider the virtues of the market as a regulatory device. This process was accompanied by a disillusionment with government itself. Considered impersonal and unresponsive, bureaucratic and inefficient, the call was for withdrawal: “Give it back to the market, call in the for-profit institution, sell the city hospital (or post office), turn to a voucher system in education, and so forth.”\nIt is perhaps the case that we had chosen the most difficult of all worlds. I do not suggest that to operate a nationalized sector effectively is easy. Indeed, that is not the case. Neither do I suggest that the solutions arrived at through normal market forces (and it is not clear what these are in the health sector but surely they are not those of pure competition) are desirable. That, too, is not the case. But operating a mixed economy (perhaps in the health field the phrase “mixed-up” economy would be more appropriate) may lead to higher costs with relatively little increase in output or redistribution for the increased dollars. It leads to a high level of frustration.\nIt is difficult to administer effective regulations—regulations designed to allocate resources and to make a real difference. In part, this is because regulation runs counter to a number of our traditions. In part, the difficulty stems from the fact that we know less than we should like to, especially about the production function for health. Regulating the construction of health facilities, for example, requires more than just a “feel” for the “right” number of hospital beds. No regulator can easily withstand the political pressure if his chief weapon is his intuition. The recognition that he lacks technical knowledge that might buttress his case against political pressures tends, therefore, to cause the administrator to shy away from regulation. Instead of saying “no,” he says “yes.” Instead of redistributing resources he calls for more dollars and more resources in the hope that some of these will trickle down and solve the particular problem with which he was initially concerned.\nTo say that today's health economy is substantially unregulated (where it counts) is, however, not to imply that government regulation that says “this you must and that you can't do” is the only solution. Much that is wrong today in the health sector derives from the fact that the structure of the health industry provides the wrong incentives. It is possible, therefore, to effect change, not by regulation but rather by substituting a different set of incentives and permitting the system to adjust to these incentives. If such a mechanism could be developed, it would have a number of advantages: it would appear (and often be) less arbitrary; it would provide us with “signals” as a feedback to tell us how the system is operating.\nLet us examine some of the issues. In so doing, we shall focus on the physician because he is the critical actor in the health care system, because access to his services is a key equity issue and because, in large measure, he determines the utilization of other parts of the system.\nFee-for-Service: Physician Control of Market Forces\nMuch of our difficulty relates to the set of incentives that impinge on the physician and the setting in which they operate. Physicians are self-employed, small businessmen and, in many critical ways, are viewed in that light. They are among the relatively few Americans who are self-employed: of the 75 million persons employed in nonagricultural industries in 1970, only 5 million were self-employed. Though there is a trend toward grouping of physicians, many of them still practice in solo, independent practice. They are subject to relatively little control or oversight. The quality of their performance may be good or bad—there is no real way to know because a data system does not exist that will record relevant information or a mechanism for performance review by impartial observers. Once licensed, they remain licensed without reassessment of their performance. With licensing and entry restrictions (generally justified as protecting the consumer and maintaining quality) but without continuing or periodic quality assessment, we have a system that, to a significant extent, protects the producer by sheltering him from the forces of competition while not requiring performance standards.\nThough many small business markets bear some resemblance to the physician market (though with different supply constraints), those sectors, most often, must meet a market test. That, perhaps, is the critical difference in health services. Consumer ignorance of medicine and health, combined with fear and customs, prevent the consumer from performing his own quality assessment, from evaluating physician performance, from examining prices. More than that is involved, however. The consumer's utilization of services is largely dependent on physician decisions. The physician (businessman) is one of the relatively few American entrepreneurs who can expand the demand for his services (and without advertising or at the expense of a competing firm). The power to influence, if not determine, the level of demand is a strong power, indeed. That there are inducements to expand demand is also clear. The system of payment, fee-for-service, is at issue. Given a payment system that has characteristics of a piece-rate wage, the power to determine the number of pieces (with “piece” defined as a procedure rather than the attainment of a desired outcome, say “cure”), and little control of quality (including excess visits or surgery and unnecessary procedures as poor quality), it is easy to see that normal market forces are not likely to involve the kind of adjustment processes that operate to equilibrate other markets. The essential factor is that the physician can control his market to a substantial degree, administering price, quantity and quality. 12\nToday's system preserves the freedom of physicians to practice where they want, the kind of medicine they want (by specialty), as well as with population groups they prefer. The physician is free to allocate his resources as he sees fit. This is a freedom given to few others in the society. Even though it is the case that government regulation does not often direct labor (allocate it by skill, occupation or location) or business, other regulatory devices (called economic incentives) do operate. They provide for allocations that are acceptable or that we believe tend to distribute the supply of services in relation to consumer demand. The quest for profits, the desire to take advantage of economic opportunity, to win the test of the marketplace, is the lubricant that, presumably, makes the story end happily. It is not clear, of course, that there are as many happy endings as our illusions suggest. Unfortunately, there is increasing evidence that rigidity in various economic sectors interferes with the adjustment process. Bigness, for example, plays its interference role; discrimination plays its interference role; licensing restrictions play their role; differential tax rates play their role; government regulation, often times converted to the protection of the regulated, plays its role. Nonetheless, the small business retail service sector does exhibit a number of competitive characteristics. Some establishments succeed and others fail. The fact that some fail means there is a test. The health sector, however, is different. It does not even offer the illusion that the forces of competition are at work to respond to consumer demand. Furthermore, meeting consumer demand for health care, as expressed in the marketplace, would not be sufficient. Today our concern is with consumer need. We cannot as readily accept the nonadjustment process that prevails in the health market.\nSuppose, however, we do not consider the physician as a businessman. Surely then his freedom, say, to settle where he would like, to specialize as he might like, is the same freedom others have—or so it might appear. Is that the case, however? As already noted, the vast majority of Americans are not self-employed. Most Americans take jobs, and this is true at all levels of the occupational ladder, including professionals. They enter fields in relation to income potentials and a projection of job opportunities. Their choice of a place to live is, in part, determined by job opportunities. In many cases, of course, these job opportunities exist all over the nation; e.g., school teachers, clothing salesmen and so forth. In other cases, the range of choice is limited. If one wants to be an aeronautical engineer, chances are one cannot live in South Hill, Virginia. If one wants to be a Supreme Court Justice, one must reside in the Washington, D.C. area. The allocation of labor and of its productive services is determined by market conditions. Many of us may be unaware of the economic controls over our behavior because they are so much a part of the system that we do not recognize them explicitly, and because they appear impersonal and not arbitrary. The young man in a small community in New England who would like to live in that small community but who would also like to be a petroleum engineer most probably does not consider that his “freedom” is restricted because he must choose between the two. Physicians in academic medicine hardly consider their freedom restricted because they cannot be both in academic medicine and in Springfield, Massachusetts (there is no medical school there). The crux of the issue is that most physicians are not employees and, therefore, meeting a test of demand by employers; but at the same time as self-employed individuals, they are not required to meet the rigorous market demand tests that other self-employed individuals face. They are insulated from the forces of competition.\nThe largely unrestricted freedoms physicians have are not the freedoms most Americans have. Yet we have somehow come to believe that to restrict the physician's freedoms is to single him out and engage in discriminatory action. Physicians, in criticizing the organization of medical care in other nations, often complain about the loss of freedom (say, to be a neurosurgeon and to practice in a particular city whose hospitals have no unfilled posts in neurosurgery). They would do well to consider that if the market in medical care were truly competitive (the results of “free enterprise,” which the very same physicians praise) significant (albeit impersonal) economic controls would influence their decisions. It is not surprising that physicians prefer the United States pattern under which they can control the market forces. What is surprising is that the layman has come to accept that situation as an essential freedom.\nThe market for some other professionals may exhibit characteristics similar to that which the physician faces, but his advantages are somewhat greater. These derive from two considerations: the first relates to the fact that the physician, though he does not have total control over the market, can exercise greater control than most and, thus, reduce the economic differentials that might otherwise obtain. The second relates to the fact that, in general, we consider medical services to be more important than various other services; indeed, it is because we so consider them that the physician faces a relatively inelastic demand curve for his services and that he can push that demand curve to the right.\nThe picture we draw is an extreme one. There are limits, of course. The physician does not have complete control (or freedom), but he does have sufficient control to affect the market so that the signals that it would normally send regarding shortage and oversupply are missing. Within the limits of the existing supply of physicians, the pressures to reach an equilibrium position that reflects needs are far too weak. One can hardly imagine that, if we had ten times as many physicians, they would be distributed as they are today. Market adjustments would take place. We do not, however, have ten times as many physicians, nor could one responsibly advocate a policy to solve market disequilibrium by increasing supply until, on some trickle-down or overflow basis, our poorer areas would be served. The costs of producing that manpower, as well as the cost of “overdoctoring” in areas that would be even richer in physician supply than they now are, can hardly lead us to advocate that solution.\nFinally, of course, we must recognize the unhappy set of coincidences that exists. If, after all, we argue that part of the problem is that the pressures to fill medical needs can be resisted because of the nature of the medical marketplace, that in no way suggests that they must be resisted. After all, there is no inexorable law of nature that says that physicians’ desires must be at variance with society's needs. One could imagine a world in which both society and physicians placed a high value on primary care and in which physicians wanted to practice in inner cities and in rural areas. In that case, physician control would be less troublesome because, even in its presence, physicians would be moving to the very areas where they were needed. But the world does not end that happily because of two factors in physician preferences.\nSpecialization and Location\nThe first factor is that for a variety of reasons an increasing proportion of physicians moves away from primary care and in many cases into specialties not closely related to the primary care function (e.g., pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology or general internal medicine). Despite the fact that leaders of American medicine and observers of the American medical scene may deplore the movement into specialties and the emphasis on surgery and on subspecialties, the energy devoted to discussing the problem has failed to change the pattern of movement. The pressures seem to be too great. One such pressure comes from the larger society from which medicine does not stand independent. The forces at work to increase specialization in other areas of activity also affect medicine. As knowledge explodes and is transmitted in innumerable journals, the pressure to specialize grows greater. As the number of specialists increases, the generalist comes to be considered as the nonexpert, and this in a society that places a high value on expertise.\nThese pressures are further reinforced by the process of medical education. The National Institutes of Health have helped enlarge the subspecialties and create a research endeavor and a reward system that many students have seen as denigrating the physician who delivers general care and is not doing research. The culture of the medical school, the nature of its faculty, the heavy emphasis on clinical teaching in the hospital (the world of the specialist), all tend to reinforce the pressures that already exist. Trained in the hospital where one sees the sickest patients, where things are happening, where time is compressed (which is one of the reasons the hospital is used as a training institution), it is no small wonder that specialists become the role model. These pressures in themselves might be sufficient, yet the nature of modern medical practice adds to them. There are significant disadvantages to being a primary care physician, particularly in individual solo practice, a type of practice that places heavy demands upon the physician.\nThe fact that the physician can validate his decision to be a specialist, in part by control of the market, leaves little hope that, in the existing system, the primary care needs will be met (except, perhaps, in the hospital outpatient department, which has special characteristics that would enable it to “succeed” or by new nonphysician kinds of personnel).\nThe second factor that inhibits the development of a more equitable geographic distribution of physicians is that physicians, like most Americans, prefer locations other than the rural area or the inner city. Furthermore, this is reinforced by the bias in medical school admissions in favor of applicants from families in the upper part of the income distribution, whose background is not likely to be the rural area or the inner city. In addition, the decision to specialize affects the geographic distribution because the specialist needs a different population base and may require different facilities, a network of relations with other physicians and so forth. Finally, the nature of practice—particularly the way medical services are disorganized at the present time—makes solo practice in the inner city and rural areas less desirable: the risks are greater, practice is hard and frustrations are many. With greater mobility than most persons physicians are able to satisfy their geographic and location preferences.\nThe critical issue, however, is not that physicians decide to be specialists and offer less primary care than needed. Nor is it that the geographic supply is maldistributed. These are results not causes. They are the outcomes of a process that permits the physician to determine the allocation of resources (his as well as much of the health sector) without the constraints set by the normal requirements of meeting consumer demand (which he can influence) or government regulation (which is weak at best and often absent). Because the allocation of resources determines access, the other side of the equity coin, we face the prospect of continued inequity even in the face of more comprehensive financing mechanisms.\nIt can, of course, be argued that under a system of universal financing, the distribution of physicians by specialty and by location would show some improvement. Surely there are physicians who, today, do not practice in locations with a high proportion of low-income families because of the difficulty that they envision in achieving a desired income level. Given an alternative financing pattern, we could expect some improvement in the maldistribution. Medicaid, after all, has made services available to some who otherwise would have gone without services. Yet the Medicaid story suggests the difficulties involved in using this approach to solve a distribution problem: the re-allocation of resources is not likely to take place in an efficient manner, quality differentials remain and so forth. We cannot assume that we will achieve the desired distribution and equal access by giving the poor money so that they will be better able to compete with the nonpoor. Even though the dollars of the poor are as green as the dollars of the rich, the poor are not likely to compete on equal terms. This is especially the case if the nonpoor can outbid the poor because they have more dollars with which to purchase the limited supply of services; i.e., if a private market continues to function.\nMaldistribution: The Difficulty of the Direct Approach\nIf equity and access are to be achieved, the distribution of physicians and of their services must change. Such changes will not come through exhortation. Intervention is required. The question is, “What kind of intervention, direct or indirect?”\nThree approaches, not involving a restructuring of the basic organization of the medical system, can be examined. The first attempts to select medical students with characteristics that, it is hoped, will alter the probabilities of various specialty and location choices. The second attempts to use the regulatory process (and coercion). The third attempts to use incentives (most probably economic in nature).\nAmerican medical education uses the first approach to a limited extent and in a rather haphazard fashion. On occasion, applicants from rural areas are given preference. A number of schools give preference to minority applicants, hoping that this will increase the services available to inner core city residents. 13 There is little hard data, however, that would provide confidence in selecting applicants with specific characteristics in an effort to change the geographic and specialty distribution of physicians. Furthermore, even were such data available, it is likely that the individual medical school admissions committee would prefer to maintain traditional standards “relying” on other medical schools to make the adjustments. Finally, the stock of physicians is so large, relative to the annual inflow of new United States graduates, that change in the distribution of the total number of physicians would occur very slowly even if new admissions’ policies were established and these were successful in attaining their objective.\nThe regulatory process, applied to specialization, would also require collective action. One could hardly expect individual hospitals or medical schools—except in rare instances—voluntarily to limit the number of residencies available in the various fields. However much physicians in Medical School X may feel there are too many residencies in the nation in Specialty Y, they may also feel that their residency provides better training than the next school's and that that school should make the needed changes. Responsible action on the part of one medical school is insufficient, and competitive forces are not likely to bring responsible action by all medical schools. Furthermore, we cannot help but recognize that in the heavily hospital-oriented present system of medical care house staff members provide a significant number of services. Voluntary action on the part of the hospitals in the absence of new financing mechanisms, and a greater emphasis on nonhospital care is, therefore, unlikely. The system is too intertwined to permit action on one front alone.\nGovernment, because it is involved with all parts of the system, could apply the regulatory process. The difficulties in this regard are clear: applied to specialization on a yes-no basis, government would receive few “signals” back to inform it that adjustments are called for. This common problem in regulation may be even more severe in the health sector. To apply regulation to locational decisions—extremely difficult to imagine, given American traditions—is also difficult. One can picture a system of coercion; e.g., two years’ service in various locations. Such an approach may have merit, if we are unprepared to attempt more basic institutional reform, but it is an incomplete solution because, like other regulatory or coercive devices, it does not attack the cause of the problem. 14\nA third alternative approach to changing the manpower distribution involves the use of economic incentives. Here, too, one can generate little optimism. We have little information on the level at which incentives would have to be set to materially affect the distribution. We do, however, know this: incentives are expensive. Extra payments to physicians to enter certain fields and to practice in certain areas cannot be offered as rewards only to those whose behavior we are trying to change. They must be offered to all. In the first place, we cannot tell whose behavior is changing and who would have “done the right thing” anyway. In the second place, it is difficult to justify an administered payment mechanism that rewards the individual who is induced into a field, and discriminates against the one who would have entered it voluntarily. Incentive payments, therefore, must be given to all. They must reward those who would have accepted smaller payments with the same amount required to induce the marginal individual to change his behavior. Finally, given the high income of physicians and present tax rates, economic incentives in the form of higher income (as contrasted with, say, vacations) are not likely to have much influence.\nAlternatives to Fee-for-Service: The Advantage of Prepaid Group Practice\nThese direct approaches to the distribution question, however, are not the only ones we need consider. Our earlier discussion suggested that many of our difficulties (and not only ones involving the distribution of physicians) stem from the fact that physicians are not subject to various market constraints (that they can influence demand and price). Is not the better approach to change these conditions? We need to intervene on the organization side rather than try to correct the consequences of the unfavorable organization.\nThe elimination of the fee-for-service payment mechanism would go a long way toward eliminating the incentive to overdoctor and the incentive to create one's own market demand. Today, fee-for-service may lead the consumer to restrict his demand, but it provides the physician with the incentive to expand it. Because the physician is more powerful in the physician-patient relationship, the consequences are apparent. Given a different method of payment, the incentives would be altered. 15\nWe can consider various alternatives to fee-for-service. Two such alternatives are capitation and salary. In either case the physician's income no longer depends on the volume of services rendered to the patient. Furthermore, if the supply of dollars available is related to the number of patients (including adjustments based on the relation between their demographic characteristics and needs; e.g., age) the available dollars will serve to cause labor market adjustments. Such a payment mechanism could be adjusted at periodic intervals in response to the way physicians distribute themselves. It cannot, however, respond to validate those decisions by making unlimited dollars available.\nTo say that the incentive has been changed is one thing. To say that the new incentive is neutral is fallacious. The situation that leaves the physician dominant vis-à-vis the patient remains, but now the patient faces a physician whose incentives are to underdoctor. This, however, seems a better situation for a number of reasons. In the present system medical ethics do not seem to be at variance with the danger of extra procedures: is it unethical to ask for one more test, one more visit, one more procedure? One should certainly like to believe that the medical ethic would inhibit the physician from underdoctoring; i.e., not doing things he should do.\nYet, this is not necessarily the case nor can we be assured that it is. Furthermore, we have already alluded to the fact that today's system exerts little control over and provides little knowledge about quality. A different payment system in itself does not insure a change in this situation. Other changes are required, though even then we cannot be fully optimistic as long as our knowledge about quality (the input and output relationship) is meager. Nonetheless, if the physician is in a situation in which data review is possible, peer review is present, consumer involvement likely and standards are set, the outcome is likely to be improved. Such a situation prevails when physicians are grouped together.\nTo suggest that grouping physicians and using salary payment mechanisms assures quality performance would be fallacious. We have, after all, had sufficient experience in recent years to be sensitive to these matters. Our schools and prisons, for example, place institutional constraints on salaried workers (who, in many cases, are professionals). Yet performance is not always responsive to the needs of the persons to be served. Our universities are staffed with salaried professionals, yet we know little about the output of the faculty. One cannot assume the prepaid group will do significantly better unless attempts are made to structure the environment, to gather data and monitor performance, to build in consumer review and involvement. Even so, we may fall short of the desired goal. We can note, however, that if we fall short it is, in large measure, because of the behavior of physicians. Is there any reason to prefer today's approach, which relies on fee-for-service to insure better performance? Does a fee-for-service mechanism in solo practice provide assurance that patient interests come first? The answers are hardly in the affirmative. That problems will remain, even in a prepaid group practice setting, is clear. That such a setting offers greater potential for solution of problems should also be clear.\nThe prepaid group practice model in which there is a fixed sum of dollars and a defined population would affect physician distribution markedly. Physician distribution would take place in accordance with supply and demand conditions (but the demand conditions would be heavily influenced by needs and by the dollars made available through the national health insurance program). If group practices had little need for the services of additional neurosurgeons, medical students would (of course, with lags and slippages) adjust their plans accordingly. Income of neurosurgeons would tend to fall if an excess supply were competing for available opportunities, thus providing yet additional “signals” to prospective entrants into the field. A similar situation would prevail as regards geographic location decisions.\nThe prepaid group practice model yields an additional benefit: the creation of a unit of responsibility (larger than the single practitioner, smaller than a regional authority) to which the consumer can relate. We need such institutions, for the physician-patient relationship is not a relationship of equals. The patient may, and sometimes does, have complaints and dissatisfactions. Yet, he finds it most difficult to voice them to his physician. Nor does one change physicians easily. In the absence of an institutional responsibility, the patient must deal with the physician in a one-to-one relationship. This may be appropriate for medical affairs, but it is inappropriate for other matters. The prepaid group practice—with consumer involvement—provides a mechanism that permits someone to speak for the patient (and permits the patient to speak to someone other than the physician). The individual patient is not dealing with the individual physician.\nThe discussion of prepaid group practice could examine a number of additional issues: hospital utilization, use of nonphysician personnel and so forth. Rather than extend the detail we have focused on what we consider the critical variables: the advantages of institutional responsibility with the potential that provides for institutional decision-making on allocation of resources within the institution and for consumer involvement in the delivery system; the constraints of a predetermined budget, and the potential advantages of such constraints on rational decision making; elimination of fee-for-service with the potential advantage of salary and capitation is changing the behavior of the physician and the allocation of physician manpower. Various of the advantages can be obtained under other arrangements, but it is not clear that other arrangements can permit all of the advantages to be obtained. 16\nGo to:\nSome Concluding Thoughts\nWe turn to the implications of a system of universal financing in conjunction with a delivery system in which physicians are paid on a salary or capitation basis. 17 In such systems the potential for an equitable distribution of health resources and services would be present. Departures from equity would depend in part on the degree to which a privately financed sector were permitted (or, if not permitted, to the degree that a black market might exist) and in part to the degree that the quality of services provided might vary with the attitudes of physicians to particular patients. These departures would be significantly less than is the case today, than would be the case with universal financing and a continuation of fee-for-service or with prepaid group practice and a continuation of private financing of medical care.\nWhat would such a system cost? There is no specific answer. We recognize that the aggregate to be devoted to health can be determined in two ways. The two approaches are perhaps illustrated by the contrast between the United States and Britain. In the United States we are able to estimate ex post what we have spent (and then only with a considerable time lag). These estimates are derived, essentially, by adding up the expenditures as determined by the millions of decisions made by consumers, providers and other participants in the health care system. There is no decision making at the macro level; the macro is the sum of the micro. Even Phase II will not change this picture, for Phase II controls prices, and the total expenditures are determined by price and quantity. 18\nThe British approach contrasts with that of the United States: aggregate expenditures are determined by government, and a host of microdecisions are made within the constraint that has been established. One could say that in the United States the real decisions are made by the actors in the health system drama and the Treasury must adjust to those decisions. In Britain the decisions are made by the Treasury, and it is the people in the health service drama who must adjust.\nUnder a national health insurance program, it would be possible to decide the level of resources that would be made available to the health sector in any particular year. This would be an important advantage. I do not suggest that discipline be exerted in quite the way that it is in Britain. Traditions in our health care sector are different. Furthermore, a national health insurance program rather than a national health service would permit of many more leakages and slippages and, very likely, a much larger role for private expenditures. Nonetheless, it would be possible to exert greater control than is the case at present in the determination of the allocation of resources to health in a given year. The determination of expenditures at central level for the given year is, however, not the only issue. We must also ask how the microdecisions adjust to the macro during the year and what pressures, therefore, build up to change the allocation to the health sector in subsequent years. Over the long run, government cannot make macrodecisions that must be translated into microdecisions that are unacceptable to providers or consumers. Similarly, providers and consumers cannot make microdecisions requiring an unacceptable macroresponse.\nIn a national program we will have to face these questions. Their solution will require changes in attitude and behavior and a restructuring of the total reward system (not simply economic rewards) in medicine. We will also have to develop ways to provide signals regarding consumer preferences within constraints that equity not be violated. How, for example, will consumers indicate their preferences for more resources in the health sector in the absence of supplementary private or local government expenditures? At present we have few answers to these kinds of questions for they are relatively new to us.\nPerhaps the answers for America will ultimately lie in a more equal distribution of income between the various states and regions. Were that achieved (and it is achievable), less reliance would have to be placed on the transfer powers of the federal government vis-à-vis the health sector. Greater consumer participation and control of a variety of institutions at local level would then permit diverse tastes and desires to send their signals to local and regional decision makers. We are far from that equality today and federal intervention is, therefore, called for.\nThese issues are not uniquely health issues. They are among the most important issues facing our society. Cast in different clothes, they are the old issues—as yet unresolved—of how much we are one nation and one people. They are yet another formulation of the question to what extent are we Americans, to what extent North Carolinians or Californians.\nThe health system can address some of these questions but the limits on its answers will be given by the total society. The sector can only change as part of a process of organic development. It is a part of our social order not apart from it. It is difficult to be optimistic about solutions to our health problems—but, perhaps, because it is difficult to be optimistic about America. Yet, because of the link between the two have we any real choice in our behavior? Optimistic or pessimistic, we have to continue to try to find the answers to our problems. To give up is to say we are certain we would not succeed in our search. Can any of us be that certain?\nGo to:\nEndnote\nReprinted from The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly, Vol. 50, No. 4, Pt. 2, 1972 (pp. 157–90). Style and usage are unchanged.\nGo to:\nReferences\n1. It is depressing to report, however, that analysts in various other applied fields seem to reach the same conclusions about their field; e.g., in the recent past the education economist has questioned the benefits of general increases in the resources devoted to education. Oftentimes this seems to be the case because of strong skepticism about the structure and effectiveness of particular government programs. Sometimes the absence of output measures seems to be at issue. An important research question is whether the disenchantment with increased resources in various fields tells us more about the field itself or more about those who are disenchanted. Perhaps analysts suffer from an overdose of skepticism (“if we can't document it, it isn't so”). Perhaps in their commendable zeal to be hardheaded, they have become hardhearted.\n2. It has proven impossible, for example, for government to withhold expensive procedures offering little (but some) likelihood of success under the Medicare program.\n3. In addition, it is unfortunately the case that benefit-cost ratios tend to emphasize the maximization of output rather than its distribution. Equity is sometimes neglected because it is difficult to quantify.\n4. In the absence of radically new financing mechanisms, income and price rationing is likely to become more, rather than less, important. Medical science and technology make possible diagnostic, curative and life-prolonging interventions that often turn out to be costly and that create an ever-increasing problem for significant parts of the population.\n5. This may strike some as a “straw-man” argument. I do not believe that to be the case. Quite often colleagues and students, not especially involved in the health area, place relatively little emphasis on a more equitable distribution of health services, not because they are less “decent” or “humane,” but because they do not consider those services that important. They then wonder why there is all the pressure, say, for national health insurance.\n6. This line of reasoning was used in appealing to the children of the aged for support for the legislation. It was suggested that, in many cases, the financial impact of illness of their parents would fall upon them.\n7. But the income distribution problem is a simpler one because, once determined, the distribution is not affected by the “involuntary” consumption of the good or service itself, by untoward events; i.e., by the “lottery” effect.\n8. Some would argue that this is true only for “essential” services. Defining “essential” is difficult. We cannot ignore our earlier discussion on the importance of public attitudes.\n9. Stuart B.

It is important to realize that a number of different factors help create the situation that makes the consumer relatively powerless: medical ethics, the white coat of the physician and so forth. The economic relations reflect other relations.\n13. This, of course, is not the only rationale for increasing the proportion of minority students in medical schools. At least two other rationales can be offered. One involves the educational impact on nonminority students; the other involves the attempt to overcome the legacy of discrimination.\n14. Such an approach may have benefits other than on the distribution side of the question. One should be clear what those benefits might be if one supports this mechanism.\n15. Although it is possible, within limits, to alter the specialty and geographic distribution of physicians even with retention of fee-for-service, by fixing the total number of dollars available to the health system (or to physicians) for the care of a given population, the preservation of fee-for-service means the preservation of fee-for-service incentives. Given that the consumer is not in a position to determine which particular service he needs, and in the presence of competition between physicians for scarce dollars, we could have continuing problems with, say, excess surgery. Furthermore, if fee-for-service is preserved, we have little assurance that all members of the community would have equal access. If the community includes poor and nonpoor, the former are likely to suffer in the competition (because the physician can still maintain his income by increasing the quantity of services made available to the nonpoor). If we agree that any system of medical care will entail rationing, our aim ought to be to structure the system in such a way to increase the probabilities that the rationing of scarce resources will be in terms of medical need. The retention of a fee-for-service arrangement will not induce the needed changes in the medical ethos. It hardly impels the physician to consider the group as well as the individual patient.\n16. A separate discussion is required for the special problems of rural areas. It should be clear, however, that there would be a potential for organization and linkages of rural practitioners to group practices and other institutions in the urban setting in the mechanisms we describe.\n17. Prepaid group practice is the element that offers various protections to the consumer. In theory, solo practice with capitation or salary—with adequate monitoring and if the number of dollars available in an area were controlled to prevent misallocations—could yield results similar to group practice along a number of axes. We believe prepaid group practice has a number of additional advantages not discussed in this paper.\n18. Indeed, even if Phase II is successful in combating inflation in prices it may work in a perverse fashion in controlling the increase in health expenditures. Price control can lead to higher utilization. Reductions in the unit cost of a day in hospital can be realized by an increase in occupancy rates, but this will increase total expenditures in the health care system. Part of the difficulty arises because of the confusion about prices and expenditures, which is reinforced by the fact that, in measuring price, we are often measuring the wrong variable. We measure the price (unit cost) of a service, not the price (total cost) of taking care of a particular condition.\nArticles from The Milbank Quarterly are provided here courtesy of Milbank Memorial Fund\nOther Formats\nPDF (134K)\nActions\nCite\nFavorites\nShare\nFeedback"]}

{"query_id": "388", "generated_response": "I'll provide you with a comprehensive overview of the tax system, covering its structure, rationale, impacts, and key considerations.\n\n## Types of Tax Systems and Their Structure\n\n### Three Main Tax System Types\n\n**Progressive Tax Systems** are the most common approach for income taxes globally [1]. In these systems, higher-income individuals pay increasingly higher tax rates as their income rises. The U.S. federal income tax is progressive, with marginal rates ranging from 10% to 37% [2]. This means everyone pays the same rate on the same dollar amounts - for example, everyone pays 10% on their first $9,875 of income, then 12% on the next bracket, and so on [6].\n\n**Proportional (Flat) Tax Systems** apply the same tax rate to everyone regardless of income level [1]. Examples include some state income taxes like Colorado (4.63%) and Illinois (4.95%) [3]. While simpler to calculate, critics argue these systems don't account for the diminishing utility value of money - each additional dollar means less to someone wealthy than to someone with limited resources [6].\n\n**Regressive Tax Systems** result in lower effective tax rates for higher-income individuals, even when the nominal rate is the same [1]. Sales taxes are inherently regressive because lower-income people spend a higher proportion of their income on taxable goods [2].\n\n### Categories of Taxes\n\n**Direct Taxes** are levied directly on individuals or entities, including:\n- Federal and state income taxes\n- Property taxes  \n- Estate and inheritance taxes\n- Capital gains taxes [2]\n\n**Indirect Taxes** are collected from intermediaries but passed on to consumers:\n- Sales taxes\n- Excise taxes (on gasoline, tobacco, alcohol)\n- Value-added taxes (VATs, common in Europe) [2][4]\n\n## Economic Impact of Taxation\n\n### Growth Effects - Mixed Evidence\n\nThe relationship between taxation and economic growth is more complex than simple models suggest. Research shows that **tax cuts for the wealthy have not demonstrably boosted economic growth** in recent decades [14]. \n\nFor example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced corporate rates from 35% to 21%, but rather than increasing investment or wages as predicted, about 80% of the corporate tax savings went to stock buybacks and dividends that primarily benefited wealthy shareholders [14].\n\n### Inequality and Redistribution\n\nTax systems significantly affect income distribution. **Progressive taxation has been effective at reducing inequality** without harming growth [6][14]. Countries like Australia achieve similar redistributive effects to higher-tax nations like Germany by relying more heavily on progressive income taxes and means-tested transfers rather than across-the-board benefits [10][16].\n\nResearch indicates that **reducing inequality between low and median-income households through taxation actually improves economic growth**, while redistribution between median and high-income households may have neutral or slightly negative growth effects [8].\n\n## State-by-State Tax Variations\n\n### Income Tax Differences\n\n**Seven states have no income tax**: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming [4][5]. New Hampshire and Tennessee only tax investment income [4].\n\n**Nine states use flat income taxes**: Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Utah [4].\n\nThe remaining states use progressive systems with varying rates. For example, California has the highest top rate at 13.3%, while North Dakota's top rate was just 3.22% [5].\n\n### Other State Tax Variations\n\n**Sales Tax**: Ranges from 0% in five states (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon) to California's 7.5% state rate [5]. Combined with local taxes, some areas reach over 11% [2].\n\n**Property Tax**: New Jersey has the highest median rate at 1.89%, while Louisiana has the lowest at 0.18% [5].\n\n## Fairness and Taxing the Rich\n\n### Arguments for Progressive Taxation\n\n**Diminishing Marginal Utility**: Each additional dollar provides less benefit to wealthy individuals than to those with lower incomes. Basic living costs (housing, food, healthcare) represent a much smaller percentage of wealthy individuals' income [6].\n\n**Social Contract Theory**: The wealthy benefit disproportionately from societal infrastructure - educated workforces, legal systems, property rights, stable institutions - that enable wealth creation. Progressive taxation represents payment for these benefits [7].\n\n**Countervailing Power**: Higher taxes on the wealthy can offset advantages from market power, rent-seeking behavior, or privileged access to government contracts [7].\n\n### Addressing Common Misconceptions\n\n**Tax Bracket Misunderstanding**: Many people incorrectly believe that earning more money could result in lower take-home pay due to \"jumping tax brackets.\" In reality, only income above each threshold is taxed at the higher rate [6].\n\n**Productivity vs. Income**: High income doesn't necessarily equal high productivity or social value. Many high earners benefit from the collective productivity of lower-paid workers and societal infrastructure [6].\n\n## Personal Tax Considerations\n\n### Regime Switching Strategies\n\nIndividuals can optimize their tax situation through:\n- **Timing of income and deductions** (bunching charitable contributions, accelerating or deferring income)\n- **Asset location strategies** (holding tax-inefficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts)\n- **State residency planning** for those with flexibility in where they live\n\n### Key Planning Considerations\n\n**Capital Gains**: Long-term capital gains (assets held over one year) are taxed at preferential rates of 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income [2].\n\n**Estate Planning**: The federal estate tax only affects estates over $12.06 million (2022), though some states have lower thresholds [4].\n\n**Retirement Accounts**: Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s provide current deductions but future taxation, while Roth accounts use after-tax dollars for tax-free growth [2].\n\n## Policy Implications\n\n### Evaluating Tax Proposals\n\nRather than focusing solely on theoretical growth effects, policymakers should evaluate tax changes based on:\n- **Revenue impact**: How much money will be raised or lost\n- **Distributional effects**: Who pays more or less\n- **Measurable outcomes**: Effects on inequality, government services, and specific economic behaviors [14]\n\n### Balance of Objectives\n\nEffective tax policy must balance multiple goals:\n- Raising adequate revenue for government services\n- Maintaining economic efficiency and growth incentives  \n- Promoting fairness and reducing excessive inequality\n- Ensuring the system is administratively feasible\n\nThe evidence suggests that **well-designed progressive taxation can achieve redistribution goals without sacrificing economic growth**, contrary to simplistic \"taxes hurt growth\" narratives. The key is implementing systems that are progressive enough to address inequality while maintaining incentives for productive economic activity.", "citations": ["https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/types-of-taxes/\n", "https://www.debt.org/tax/type/", "https://thepersonalfinancewriter.com/different-types-of-tax/", "https://www.policygenius.com/taxes/types-of-taxes/\n", "https://taxandbusinessonline.villanova.edu/blog/how-tax-codes-vary-by-state/\n", "https://leftcall.com/21456/tax-the-rich-liberal-argument-for-progressive-tax-system-for-economic-growth/\n", "https://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/03/the-fairness-of-progressive-taxation.html", "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecoj.12485", "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11293-010-9244-0", "https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/less-income-inequality-and-more-growth-are-they-compatible-part-3-income-redistribution-via-taxes-and-transfers-across-oecd-countries_5k9h296b1zjf-en", "https://ideas.repec.org/p/btx/wpaper/1120.html", "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/impact-of-taxes-on-growth-and-distribution-in-developed-capitalist-countries-a-crossnational-study/464318FD23393774A27911D2E77AE73D", "https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:ecmode:v:29:y:2012:i:5:p:2049-2057", "https://equitablegrowth.org/the-relationship-between-taxation-and-u-s-economic-growth/\n", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5188707_The_Effect_of_Taxes_on_Economic_Behavior", "https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/tackling-income-inequality_eco_studies-2012-5k95xd6l65lt"], "contexts": ["Types Of Taxes - Intelligent Economist\nTypes of Taxes\nLast updated: February 3, 2022 by Prateek Agarwal\nThere are three main types of taxes, each with very different properties: progressive, proportional, and regressive. This article will describe the most important details of each of these systems.\nContents show\nDirect and Indirect Taxes\nDirect taxes are taxes on wealth, profit, and income. Such taxes are levied on the individual’s income or profits. Indirect taxes are placed on goods, and the burden of the tax can be divided between the buyer and the seller. For example, the statewide sales tax in the state of California is 7.25%.\nA marginal tax rate is an extra tax imposed for each additional dollar earned. The average tax rate is the ratio of the total tax paid over the total income earned.\nTypes of Taxes\n1. Progressive Tax System\nIn a progressive tax rate system, higher-income individuals pay an increasingly higher proportion of tax as their incomes rise. In this case, the marginal tax rate would be higher than the average tax rate. A progressive tax is cited as a method to reduce overall inequality in society, and also contributes to economic growth and reduced unemployment by increasing low-income people’s purchasing power.\nMost economies around the world use a progressive tax to assess taxes for individual income. Common, well-known examples of progressive taxes include estate taxes, tax on interest earned from savings and investments, and tax credits for vulnerable groups.\n2. Proportional Tax System\nIn a proportional tax rate system, which is also known as a flat tax, everyone pays the same proportion of their income as tax, no matter how high or low their income is. The tax rate does not change with an increase or decrease in income, although many critics note that proportional taxes unfairly burden those with fewer resources.\nIn this system, the average tax rate is equal to the marginal tax rate. It exists in Latvia and Russia and is considered by some to be more “fair” and easier to manage for everyone, since no one is exempt. Some states in the U.S., such as Colorado, Utah, and Michigan, impose a proportional income tax for individuals. Another example of proportional taxation is the U.S. sales tax, as all consumers pay the same fixed tax rate as a percentage of the cost of the goods they’re purchasing.\n3. Regressive Tax System\nA regressive tax is a type of tax that results in a decrease in the tax rate as the amount subject to taxation increases. In a regressive tax rate system, individuals with lower incomes pay a higher proportion of their income as tax than individuals with higher incomes. Here, the marginal tax rate is lower than the average tax rate.\nAny tax with a cap above which no taxes are paid can be considered a regressive tax. Examples of regressive tax include some forms of property taxes as well as sin taxes, among others.\nProgressive vs. Proportional vs. Regressive Taxes\nAs you now know, tax systems can be either progressive, proportional, or regressive. To reiterate, progressive taxes have greater financial ramifications for the wealthy⁠—for those with higher incomes, who pay a higher proportion of their total income⁠—than for the poor.\nProportional taxes have a fairly equal financial effect on earners of all income levels, because everyone in such a system pays the same tax rate (although low-income taxpayers have much less money left over, so in practice the effects are not actually even across the board).\nFinally, regressive taxes have a much stronger effect on low-income individuals and families than on those with high incomes. Of these three kinds of taxes, the most common is a progressive tax schedule, which ensures that low-income earners don’t lose a higher proportion of their earnings to taxation than the rest of society.\nSimilar Posts:\nRegressive Tax\nProportional Tax\nProgressive Tax\nEquitable Distribution of Income\nThe Multiplier Effect", "Types of Taxes – Income, Property, Goods, Services, Federal, State\nTypes of Taxes\nThere are dozens of different types of taxes. Some are levied on income, some on personal property and some on goods and services. Learn about each below.\nUpdated: October 12, 2021 | Bill Fay\nHome > Taxes > Types of Taxes\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, “Taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.” One can argue about the extent and quality of the civilization that we receive for our tax dollars, but it can’t be denied that we do pay a lot for it.\nIn fact, when every tax is tallied – federal, state and local income tax (corporate and individual); property tax; Social Security tax; sales tax; excise tax; and others – Americans spend 29.2 percent of our income in taxes each year.\nThere are many different kinds of taxes, most of which fall into a few basic categories: taxes on income, taxes on property, and taxes on goods and services.\nTaxes on Income\nThe federal government, 41 states and many local municipalities levy income taxes on personal and business revenue and interest income. In most cases, income tax brackets are progressive, meaning that the higher the income, the higher the rate of taxation. Federal rates for the 2021 tax year range from 10 to 37%. State and city rates are generally much lower. In addition, most systems allow individuals to reduce their tax bill with various credits, deductions and allowances. Businesses pay taxes on their net income.\nIn addition to federal income taxes, the U.S. government also mandates that employers subtract payroll taxes from their workers’ paychecks each pay period, and then match the sums deducted. These payments are called FICA taxes because they are authorized by the Federal Insurance Contribution Act. Total FICA taxes on individual workers are 7.65 percent of income; 6.2 percent goes to fund the nation’s Social Security system, while 1.45 percent goes to Medicare. Self-employed individuals are liable for the entire 15.3 percent, although one half of that amount can be taken as an above-the-line business deduction on a person’s income tax return.\nCapital gains taxes are those paid on any profits made from the sale of an asset and are usually applied to home sales, stock and bond transactions. The capital gains tax rate for 2021 is 0%, 15% or 20%. Your rate depends on the amount of your taxable income. The higher your income, the higher your rate. Profits made from the sale of real estate are also subject to a capital gains tax. Single homeowners may exclude up to $250,000 of capital gain on the sale of a home, as long as the home was a principal residence for at least two of the five years before the sale; married couples filing jointly can exclude up to $500,000.\nEstate taxes can be considerable, but less than one-tenth of 1 percent of taxpayers have to pay them, which means 99.9% of us don’t have to worry about this. The estate tax exempts the first $11.7 million for an individual and $23.4 million for a married couple. Estate taxes are imposed on the transfer of property upon the death of the owner. They were created to prevent the perpetuation of tax-free wealth within the country’s most affluent families. The maximum top estate tax rate is 40%. Many states also impose their own estate tax, sometimes known as an inheritance tax. Opponents of these types of taxes believe that they are an unfair confiscation of wealth passed on to an heir and call them “death taxes.” A tax related to the estate tax, and assessed in a similar manner, is the gift tax, levied on a transfer of wealth during a person’s lifetime. The first $15,000 of a gift is excluded from the tax.\nLearn more about income tax.\nTaxes on Property\nProperty tax, sometimes known as an ad valorem tax, is imposed on the value of real estate or other personal property. Property taxes are usually imposed by local governments and charged on a recurring basis. For example, homeowners will generally pay their real estate taxes either once a year or as a monthly fee as part of their mortgage payments.\nReal estate taxes are often subject to fluctuation based upon a jurisdiction’s assessment of the worth of a property based on its condition, location and market value, and/or changes to the amounts apportioned to various recipients of the tax. For example, if residents of a community have voted to increase the millage rate (the amount per $1,000 that is used to calculate taxes) for a school system, homeowners could see an increase in the tax levied on their properties. Conversely, if property values have fallen due to adverse economic circumstances, home taxes may decrease.\nOther items that may be subject to a property tax are automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles and airplanes. Some states also tax other types of business property such as factories, wharves, etc.\nTaxes on Goods and Services\nThe sales tax is most often used as a method for states and local governments to raise revenue. Purchases made at the retail level are assessed a percentage of the sales price of a particular item. Rates vary widely between jurisdictions with 45 state collecting sales tax. Southern states like Tennessee (9.55%), Louisiana (9.52), Arkansas (9.51) and Alabama (9.22) have the top combine state and average local sales tax rate. Washington State also is in that group at 9.23%.\nLocal sales tax, typically administered by a city or county, are collected in 38 states. Surprisingly, the local sales tax in some places is higher than the state tax rate. For example, the average local sales tax rate in Alabama is 5.22% while the state sales tax is 4.0% for a combined total of 9.22%.\nBelieve it or not, the top combined city and state sales taxes is 11.5% that’s paid in Gould, Ark. Chicago, Long Beach (CA) and Glendale (CA) are all a distant second at 10.25%. Los Angeles (9.5%) and New York City (8.875%) are far behind.\nIt’s worth noting that taxes also vary on the type of item bought. For example, a pair of shoes may be taxed at one rate, restaurant food at another, while some items, like staple commodities bought at a grocery store, may not be taxed at all. Also, the same shoes may be taxed at a different rate if sold in a different state or county.\nSome believe that sales taxes are the most equitable form of taxation, since they are essentially voluntary and they extract more money from those who consume more. Others believe that they are the most regressive form of taxation, since poorer people wind up paying a larger portion of their income in sales taxes than wealthier individuals do.\nExcise taxes are based on the quantity of an item and not on its value. For example, the federal government imposes an excise tax of 18.4 cents on every gallon of gas purchased, regardless of the price charged by the seller. States often add an additional excise tax on each gallon of fuel.\nUser fees are taxes that are assessed on a wide variety of services, including airline tickets, rental cars, toll roads, utilities, hotel rooms, licenses, financial transactions and many others. Depending upon where someone lives, a cellphone, for example, may have as many as six separate user taxes, running up the monthly bill by as much as 20 percent.\nSo-called sin taxes are imposed on items like cigarettes and alcohol. For example, the cigarette tax in Connecticut and New York is $4.35 per pack, highest in the nation. In Georgia, the same tax is 37 cents a pack.\nLuxury taxes are imposed on certain items, such as expensive cars or jewelry. For example\nAbout The Author\nBill Fay\nBill “No Pay” Fay has lived a meager financial existence his entire life.

It\nprobably started with a definition of Economics and an explanation of concepts\nsuch as scarcity, resources, opportunity cost, among others.\nThree or four classes in and you\nprobably began to learn about taxation. Some of the topics would include Adam\nSmith’s canons of taxation, taxation as fiscal policy, among others. Today,\nI want you to think back to the time you learnt about the different types of\ntaxes – proportional, progressive, and\nregressive.\nPerhaps you learnt them back then\nto pass your exams, and you have no clue how they affect your finances today.\nWell, this is an opportunity to\nrevisit that class. We will look at the three\ndifferent types of taxes, how they affect your finance, and some examples of\nhow they work in real life.\nLet’s dive in.\nWhat are Proportional Taxes?\nProportional taxation is a tax system that levies the same tax rate on\nindividuals irrespective of their income or wealth.\nAnother name for proportional\ntaxation is flat tax.\nThe rate of taxation does not\nchange with increasing or decreasing levels of income or wealth.\nSome states in the United States\nlevy income tax based on the proportional tax system. These states\ninclude Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, North\nCarolina, Pennsylvania, and Utah.\nFor example, if you live in\nColorado, your state income tax rate is 4.63% irrespective of income. The tax\nrate is 4.95% in Illinois and 3.23% in Indiana.\nHow do proportional taxes work?\nLet’s say Mr Johnson is a financial\nanalyst who earns an income of $80,000 in Colorado while Mrs Jane is a nurse\nwho makes $60,000 in the same state.\nMr. Johnson’s tax liability is\n$3,704 (4.63% * $80,000) while Mrs. Jane’s tax liability is $2,778 (4.63% *\n$60,000).\nThe income tax rate does not vary\nwith income level.\nOther types of taxes that use the\nproportional tax system include:\nOccupational\nTaxes\nThe financial\ndictionary defines occupational taxes as “Taxes and fees levied on\nparticular jobs and businesses. A liquor license for a bar and a health permit\nfor a restaurant are both examples of occupational taxes. In the United States,\noccupational taxes are assessed at the state and local levels and generally are\nflat fees.”\nPer\nCapita Taxes:\nThey are taxes levied on the\nresidents of a jurisdiction above a certain age. Per capita taxes are also\nknown as head taxes.\nThey depends on residency rather\nthan income or wealth. Per capital taxes are proportional taxes.\nWhat are the advantages of Proportional Taxes?\nProponents of the proportional\ntax system believe it encourages hard\nwork since your tax rate will not change even with a higher level of\nincome.\nThey also believe it is fair. One\nadvocate of proportional taxes is Ben Carson. He wrote, “I’ve advocated a\nproportional tax system. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10,\nyou pay one. And everybody gets treated the same way.”\nAlso, the proportional tax system removes the complications from tax\ncomputations. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry can compute the taxes due on their\nincome.\nGary Cohn believes this is an\nessential goal for any tax system. In his words, “We want to go back to a\ntax system where Americans sit down at their kitchen table, and they do their\ntaxes on a single sheet of paper. That’s what we should have in this America.”\nHowever, critics of the\nproportional tax system (those on the progressive side) will argue that it does not satisfy the canon of justice\nand equality since it treats low-income earners in the same way as high-income\nearners.\nOther critics (those on the regressive side) will argue that it does not incentivize hard work and higher income since there is no tax advantage from an increase in income level.\nWhat are Progressive Taxes?\nProgressive taxation is a tax system where the tax rate is directly\nproportional to the income level. The higher the income, the higher the\neffective rate of tax, vice versa.\nThe United States Federal\nIncome Tax follows the progressive tax system.\nThe Federal Income Tax uses a tax\ntable that begins with a 10% tax rate on income less than or equal to $9875\nfor single filers, $19,750 for joint filers, and $14,100 for a head of\nhousehold.\nThe table ends with the 37% marginal\ntax rate for incomes exceeding $518,401 for single filers and head of\nhousehold, $622,051 for joint filers, $311,026 for married couples filing\nseparately.\nHow do progressive taxes work?\nSay Mr Price earns $40,000 as a\nCPA and Miss Judith earns $90,000 as an investment banker. Let’s also assume\nthat they are both single filers .\nMr Price’s tax liability from the\ntax table will be as follows:\nFirst $9,875 –> 10% * $9875 =\n$987.5\nNext $30,125 ($40,000-$9,875)\n-> 12% * $30,125 = $3,615\nTotal Tax Liability = $4,602.5\nEffective Tax Rate = $4,602.5/$40,000 = 11.5%\nMiss Judith’s tax liability from\nthe tax table will be as follows:\nFirst $9,875 –> 10% * $9875 =\n$987.5\nNext $30,250 ($40,125-$9875)\n-> 12% * $30,250 = $3,630\nNext $45,400 ($85,525-$40,125)\n-> 22% * $45,400 = $9,988\nNext $4,475 ($90,000-$85,525)\n-> 24% * $4,475 = $1,074\nTotal Tax Liability = $15,679.5\nEffective Tax Rate = $15,679.5/$90,000 = 17.4%\nMiss Judith, who earns more than\nMr Price does, is subject a higher tax rate (17.4%).\nThe estate tax is\nanother progressive tax. They are payable on estates with assets exceeding\n$11.4 million at the federal level. At the state level, the limit is lower,\nwhich draws more estates into the tax pool. The tax rate on estates increases\nwith their value.\nWhat are the Advantages of Progressive Tax?\nAdvocates of progressive tax believe it promotes equality and justice since\nhigher-income earners have a higher capacity to pay.\nCritics of the progressive tax\nargue that it is an income\nredistribution strategy that takes from the rich to sponsor programs\ndesigned for the poor (remember Robinhood?).\nThey argue that such programs discourage people from working hard and\nincreasing their income since such an increase in income leads to higher\ntax rates.\nIf the calculation above seems like rocket science to you, then you are not alone. Critics of progressive tax system believe it is too complicated and stressful. Even Alfred Neuman commented that “Today, it takes more brains and effort to make out the income-tax form than it does to make the income.”\nWhat are Regressive Taxes?\nThe regressive taxation system is\nthe opposite of the progressive system. The\neffective tax rate in this system increases as income level falls (inversely\nproportional). People with higher income levels pay taxes at a lower tax rate\nwhile those with lesser income pay taxes at a higher income rate.\nThe regressive tax structure\noccurs where tax is a fixed amount relative to income because the taxing\nauthority calculates the tax rate on a basis (consumption, asset) other than\nincome levels.\nThat is, though the tax rate is\nconstant, it is not calculated on income levels like the proportional tax\nsystem.\nIn the case where it is\ncalculated on income levels (social security tax), there is a cap on the amount\nof income subject to tax which makes people with higher income level enjoy a\nlower effective tax rate compared to people with lower income level.\nThe sales tax on goods is an example of a regressive tax system.\nHow do Regressive Taxes Work?\nLet us say Mr Bauer and Mrs Chloe\npurchase items worth $3,000 in the grocery store on the same day. With a sales\ntax of 6%, they will have a tax liability of $180 each.\nHowever, if Mr Bauer’s income is\n$100,000 and Mrs Chloe’s income is $50,000, the former has just paid 0.18% of\nhis income as sales tax while the latter paid 0.36%.\nIf at the end of the year, they\nboth spent $20,000 in the grocery store; their sales tax liability will be\n$1,200. For Mr Bauer, this is 1.2% of his income. For Mrs Chloe, this is 2.4%\nof her income. Mr Bauer has a lower effective tax rate even though his income\nis higher.\nOther types of regressive taxes\ninclude:\nProperty\ntaxes:\nProperty taxes are calculated on\nthe value of a property. If two people with different income levels pay the\nsame property tax, the proportion of tax to income will be lower for the person\nwith the higher income and higher for the person with the lower income.\nSpecific excise taxes:\nThey are fixed dollar amounts\nadded to a product on a per-unit basis.\nSince the tax liability is the\nsame irrespective of income, higher-income earners have a lower effective tax\nrate compared to lower-income earners.\nSocial\nSecurity Taxes:\nSocial Security is a 6.2% tax on\nincome. However, the tax is not payable on income exceeding $137,700.\nTherefore, for someone earning\n$200,000, he will only pay $8537.40 in social security tax. Someone earning\n$1,000,000 will only pay $8537.40.\nConsider two individuals: Mr Scofield,\nwho earns $100,000 and Mr Burrows, who earns $200,000. Mr Scofield will pay\n$6,200 in social security tax while Mr Burrows will pay $8537.40. The effective\ntax rate of the former is 6.2% ($6,200/$100,000) while the effective tax rate\nof the latter is 4.3%.\nThe example above shows that the\none with the higher income has a lower effective tax rate, and the one with the\nlower income has a higher effective tax rate.\nWhat are the Advantages of Regressive Tax?\nAdvocates of the regressive tax\nsystem believe it incentivizes hard work by rewarding high-income earners with the lower effective tax rate.\nCritics argue that the regressive system does not align with the canon of equity and justice.\nConclusion\nThe three types of tax have advantages\nand disadvantages. Different economies use a mix of the three systems in\ndifferent ways. Proportional and\nprogressive taxes are common with taxes on income, while regressive taxes are\ncommon with taxes on consumption.\nUnderstanding the three different\ntax systems will help you get a handle on your tax situation and explore ways\nto increase your tax efficiency.\nDo you want to learn more about\nhow taxes affect your financial situation?

They apply to our paychecks, the prices of products we buy, and the services we use. You may also have to pay taxes on your home, your car, investments, and money you want to pass on to your loved ones as you get older. Sometimes the lines blur between the different kinds of taxes, but below we’ll cover three common methods of taxation — progressive, regressive, and proportional — as well as the most common types of taxes you may encounter.\nKey takeaways\nThere are three main types of taxes: progressive, with higher rates the more you have; regressive, with lower rates as you have more; and proportional, with you always paying a flat rate.\nThere are many types of income taxes for everything from your salary to an inheritance.\nSales tax is a type of ad valorem tax that applies according to the value of the good or service you’re buying.\nExcise taxes are are a popular way governments to raise revenue and include classic sin taxes, such as on alcohol and tobacco.\nThree main types of taxes\nWhile there are many individual taxes, there are three main types of taxation and they describe ways that a tax applies to the person or group being taxed:\nProgressive taxes\nRegressive taxes\nFlat or proportional taxes\nProgressive taxes\nWith a progressive tax, the more income you have that is subject to tax, the higher your average tax rate is. The term “progressive” comes from the fact that as taxable income increases, the tax rate gets progressively higher. Most income taxes in the United States are progressive taxes. A progressive income tax may also be referred to as a graduated income tax.\nRegressive taxes\nThe opposite of a progressive tax is a regressive tax. With regressive taxes, as you have more that is subject to tax, your average tax rate is lower. One example of a regressive tax is the Social Security tax, a type of payroll tax that everyone needs to pay on their first $147,000 of income in 2022 (up from $142,800 in 2021). [1] The higher your income goes above that limit, the lower the average rate that you pay on your overall income.\nProportional and flat taxes\nA proportional tax, or flat tax, is one where the amount you pay is proportional to the amount of income you have. For example, if a state had a flat income tax of 5%, each taxpayer would pay 5% of their taxable income, regardless of how much income they have.\nGet your finances right, one money move at a time.

The following are examples of the types taxes you may actually pay in your daily life:\nFederal income tax\nAlternative minimum tax (AMT)\nState and local income taxes\nFICA and other payroll taxes\nSelf-employment tax\nCapital gains tax\nEstate tax\nInheritance tax\nGift tax\nGeneration-skipping transfer tax\nWealth tax\nBusiness and corporate taxes\nFederal income tax\nThe federal income tax applies to your wages, earnings, and other forms of income. U.S. income tax is a progressive tax with marginal tax brackets, where each tax rate applies only to income within a certain range. Income tax is collected over the course of the year, usually by withholding a certain amount from each of your paychecks. If you are self-employed or a freelancer, you will probably need to make estimated tax payments each quarter since no tax is withheld from your paychecks. Ideally, you would pay the exact amount of tax you need to, but most people overpay and receive a tax refund each year after filing their income tax return.\nLearn more about how to file your income taxes in 2022.\nAlternative minimum tax (AMT)\nThe alternative minimum tax is another type of federal income tax that works alongside the regular system. If you have certain kinds of income or wealth — like some employee stock options — they aren’t always subject to regular income tax. AMT covers these other sources of income to ensure that you pay tax on them if they are worth more than a certain amount. AMT doesn’t start to apply until your 2022 income reaches $75,900 if you're a single filer or $118,100 if you're married filing jointly. [2] For 2021, the AMT threshold was $73,600 for single filers and $114,600 for joint filers. [3]\nState and local income taxes\nLike the federal government, most states have their own income tax for residents of the state and potentially people who work in the state even if they don’t live there. Most states also all have a progressive tax with marginal tax brackets, though the number of brackets and the income ranges differ. For example, in 2022 Alabama has tax rates of 2%, 4%, and 5% depending on your income.\nOnly seven states do not have an income tax:\nAlaska\nFlorida\nNevada\nSouth Dakota\nTexas\nWashington\nWyoming\nNew Hampshire and Tennessee tax income from interest and dividends, but don't tax most regular income. (Tennessee’s tax on investment income will expire in 2022.)\nNine states have a flat income tax:\nColorado\nIllinois\nIndiana\nKentucky\nMassachusetts\nMichigan\nNorth Carolina\nPennsylvania\nUtah\nSome cities, counties, and local governments also collect income taxes. As examples, in Missouri, both Kansas City and St. Louis collect an income tax. In Maryland, each county collects its own income tax. In Oregon, cities in the Portland area pay an income tax to support public transit.\nFICA and other payroll taxes\nEmployers remove payroll taxes from each of your paychecks and send them to the appropriate government agency. In addition to income taxes, there are federal taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare, which together are the FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) taxes. For 2021 and 2022, the Social Security tax is 6.2% of an employee’s income and the Medicare tax is 1.45%. Employers also contribute an equal amount of FICA tax for each employee.\nThere is an additional Medicare surtax of 0.9% for single filers who earn more than $200,000 and joint filers who earn more than $250,000. This tax applies only to income above those thresholds and is called the Additional Medicare Tax.\nSelf-employment tax\nIf you’re self-employed, you still have to pay income and payroll taxes. But instead of paying income tax out of your paychecks the way employees do, you will need to make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS.\nTo pay into Social Security and Medicare, you will need to pay self-employment tax, which you may also see called SECA tax (Self Employed Contributions Act Tax), instead of FICA tax. SECA is the same as FICA except that you pay twice as much as a regular employee to cover what’s usually the employee and employer portion of the taxes. The good news is that you can deduct 50% of your self-employment taxes when you file your annual income taxes.\nSee more tax deductions and credits you can claim in 2022.\nCapital gains tax\nWhen you sell assets — like investments, real estate, or a cryptocurrency — you likely have to pay capital gains tax on your net gains. You may also have to pay tax when you sell collectible or valuable items, such as jewelry or a collection of rare stamps.\nThe capital gains tax rate you pay depends largely on how long you owned the asset. You pay the short-term capital gains rates if you held assets for one year or less. These rates are the same as regular income tax rates. You pay the long-term capital gains rates, which are lower than the regular tax rates, if you held assets for more than one year. Note that states that collect income tax also collect capital gains taxes.\nLearn more in our guide to capital gains tax.\nEstate tax\nEstate tax applies to the money and assets in your estate — the collection of everything that’s passed on after your death, like cash, investments, real estate, and other valuables. You may see estate tax called a death tax.\nThe federal government collects an estate tax, but very few estates have to worry about it because it only applies to estates worth at least $12.06 million in 2022 (up from $11.7 million in 2021). The District of Columbia and 12 states also have their own estate tax, with some states using the same exemption as the federal government — estates worth less than $12.06 million being exempt in 2022 — but some states have lower exemptions. Massachusetts has one of the lowest exemptions at $1 million.\n(Most of your assets factor into your estate’s value, but note that the death benefit from a life insurance policy does not.)\nInheritance tax\nSimilar to an estate tax, inheritance tax applies to what’s passed on after someone dies. However, the person inheriting the money or assets must pay the inheritance tax. There is no federal inheritance tax and just six states collect an inheritance tax. (Maryland is the only state to collect both an estate and inheritance tax.) Inheritance tax rates depend on how much you inherit and your relationship to the deceased. Spouses are always exempt from inheritance tax.\nDo you live in a state with inheritance tax? Understand what you may have to pay with our state-by-state guide to inheritance taxes.\nGift tax\nThe federal gift tax applies when someone gives money or other valuable assets worth $15,000 or more to someone else. The person giving the gift is the one who has to pay gift tax, though no one actually has to pay it unless they’ve already given away enough during their lifetime to exceed the lifetime exclusion of $12.06 million in 2022. So while a gift of $50,000 would exceed the annual exclusion and you would need to report that gift to the IRS, you may not actually have to pay tax on it. Gift tax can also apply if you sell something for less than its fair market value, like if you sell someone a car that’s worth $30,000 but only receive $10,000 for it. Gift tax works in conjunction with estate tax\nRead more about what gift tax is and who pays it.\nGeneration-skipping transfer tax\nAlongside the gift tax there is also the generation-skipping transfer tax (GST tax). The GST tax applies any time someone gives money or valuable assets to a grandchild or to an unrelated person who is at least 37.5 years younger than they are. The generation-skipping tax exemption is the same as the annual and lifetime gift tax exclusions.\nTo minimize GST taxes, consider a generation-skipping trust.\nWealth tax\nA wealth tax is a tax on a person’s entire net worth. Your net worth is the combined value of your annual income, personal savings, investment accounts, property, real estate, and other belongings, like jewelry or collectibles.\nThe U.S. does not have a wealth tax, though some politicians have proposed one as a way to raise tax revenue. The most similar type of tax is the federal estate tax, but that only applies to an estate’s value after an individual passes away.\nSee how your net worth compares to the average American.\nBusiness tax and corporate income tax\nWith individual income taxes, you generally pay tax based on the total amount you made (revenue). Corporate taxes typically apply to a company’s profit, which is its revenue minus expenses. Corporate tax rates are also different from individual tax rates. Instead of the seven marginal rates, the federal corporate tax rate is a flat 21%. Many states also have rates that are different from their regular income tax rates. For example, Maine’s personal income tax rates start at 5.8% and go up to 7.15% across three income brackets. [4] The corporate tax rates range from 3.5% up to 8.93% across four brackets. [5]\nTaxes on property\nProperty taxes are considered ad valorem taxes. An ad valorem tax is based directly on the value of a good, service, or real estate property. The most common type of ad valorem tax in the U.S. is property tax for your home and other real estate. States may also have personal property taxes that apply to valuable possessions like a car or boat.\nAd valorem taxes generally involve determining the fair market value (FMV) of your property and then applying a tax rate to either it’s full FMV or a pre-determined taxable portion of the FMV.\nProperty tax\nWhen you buy a home, in addition to your mortgage and homeowners insurance, you will have to pay property tax based on the value of your property (real estate). City or county governments usually collect property taxes, but some areas also levy taxes by school district or business district. Many places don’t collect property taxes based on the entire value of your home, either. For example, you may live in an area that determines your property tax bill based on just 40% of the fair market value of your home.\nLearn more about how property taxes work.\nPersonal property tax\nTangible personal property tax applies to tangible (physical) and movable items that an individual owns. State and local governments commonly levy taxes on certain kinds of personal property, like cars, boats, or structural additions to a mobile home. Businesses and self-employed workers may also have to pay tax on pieces of tangible property that are used by the business to earn income, like machinery and even furniture.\nTaxes on goods and services\nWhen you purchase certain goods or services, you may have to pay a consumption tax. Consumption taxes are often indirect taxes because even though the government is collecting from a retailer, the person who buys the good is the one who ultimately pays the tax. (A direct tax applies not to goods or transactions but to someone’s income, profit, or assets. Federal income tax and property taxes are direct taxes.)\nBelow are four common types of consumption taxes:\nSales taxes\nValue-added taxes (VATs)\nExcise taxes\nTariffs\nSales tax\nSales tax applies to goods or services you buy, and you pay them at the point of sale. There is no sales tax at the federal level, but states, counties, and cities may all have their own taxes. City and local sales tax applies in addition to state level sales tax.\nSales tax rates vary by location and by the type of sale. For example, a state may exempt clothing purchases from sales tax, but then collect a 2% tax on groceries and a 4% tax on all other goods.\nSales tax is also a type of ad valorem tax since the amount you pay depends directly on the value of what you’re buying.\nValue-added tax\nA value-added tax (VAT) applies to goods you purchase. It’s similar to a sales tax but different because a VAT isn’t just applied to the final sale price of a product. It applies at each stage of the production process, based on the value that has been added to the product. Since tax is applied throughout production, the price you see in a store already includes the VAT. This also differs from sales tax, which you pay in addition to a retailer’s price.\nThe U.S. does not have a VAT but it is common in other countries and especially in Europe. Like sales tax, this is also an ad valorem tax.\nExcise tax\nAn excise tax applies to particular goods, services, and activities. Excise taxes are usually more specific in scope than a general sales tax, and they may be paid by retailers, consumers, or manufacturers. Excise taxes are a very popular way for federal and state governments to raise revenue. According to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, federal excise tax revenue in 2017 was nearly $100 billion. [6] Individual states may also have excise taxes.\nExcise taxes are usually included in the price you see for a product instead of added at the point of sale like a sales tax. Some excise taxes are ad valorem: When you buy an airline ticket, there is a 7.5% excise tax included in the ticket price. Other excise taxes are the same no matter the value of the product. For example, the federal government levies an excise tax of 18.4 cents per gallon of regular gasoline. Whether a specific company was planning to sell you gasoline for $2 or $3 per gallon, the excise tax is still 18.4 cents per gallon in 2022. [7]\nCommon types of excise taxes you’ll see at either the federal or state level are on alcohol, tobacco, fuel, airfare, and telecommunications services. While a bit outdated, you may also see the term “sin tax” to refer to excise taxes on products or activities that are considered harmful to individuals or to society as a whole. The excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco are considered sin taxes, as are those on sugary drinks, gambling, and indoor tanning.\nTariffs\nA tariff is a tax on goods that cross national borders. The country importing the good collects the tariff. In many cases, tariffs are a way for a government to bolster local businesses or to level the playing field with foreign competition. For a real-life example, here’s a look at tariffs the Trump administration imposed on Chinese goods.\nSurtaxes\nA surtax doesn’t fit into any single category because it’s just a tax on something that is already taxed. Surtaxes, sometimes called surcharges, usually apply only to individuals who are above a certain income or earning threshold. As an example, all taxpayers pay Medicare tax but single filers who earn more than $200,000 also have to pay a surtax of 0.9% (the Additional Medicare Tax) on all their wages that exceed $200,000. Some advocates of a wealth tax have also proposed it as a surtax on income above a certain income level.\nGet essential money news & money moves with the Easy Money newsletter.\nFree in your inbox each Friday.\nSign up now\nReferences\nLast updated on\nDecember 22, 2021|\nSources\nAuthor\nDerek Silva\nSenior Editor & Personal Finance Expert\nDerek is a former senior editor and personal finance expert at Policygenius, where he specialized in financial data, taxes, estate planning, and investing.

Email us at", "State Tax Codes | Taxation Resources\nHome / Blog / How Tax Codes Vary by State\nHow Tax Codes Vary by State\nArticles | Taxation\nEach resident of the United States is subject to the same federal taxation laws. These laws include income, gift, estate and employment taxes. But tax liability at the state level can vary dramatically, depending on the state where you live, work or engage in economic activities.\nState governments have significant flexibility in how they choose to implement income, sales, property and other types of taxes. Whether you’re pursuing an advanced degree in taxation or want a better understanding of the U.S. tax system, discover some of the ways state tax codes differ from one another.\nIncome Tax\nSeven states have no income tax — Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. According to a 2015 report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, New Hampshire and Tennessee forgo taxes on wages, but impose taxes on other forms of income. Three states — Illinois, Indiana and Pennsylvania — have a flat income tax, meaning the same tax rate is applied to everyone. The remaining states have a graduated tax structure, where rates of taxation vary depending on income level.\nIn addition to these structural differences, tax rates vary greatly among the states. For example, TaxFoundation.org reports that North Dakota’s top individual income tax rate was 3.22 percent in 2014. On the other end of the spectrum, California’s highest individual income tax rate that year was 13.3 percent.\nSales Tax\nIn looking at state sales tax policy for 2015, TaxFoundation.org found that five states — Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon — have no sales tax, and of these, Delaware, New Hampshire and Oregon also prohibit local governments from levying sales tax. As with income tax, California has the highest state sales tax rate in the country at 7.5 percent, while Colorado has the lowest rate of states that charge sales tax, at 2.9 percent.\nExcise Tax\nThe cost of some goods may also include excise tax. Excise taxes are levied based on item quantity, such as the 18.4 cent-per-gallon federal excise tax on gasoline. As Alexander E. M. Hess explained in USA Today, some states levy excise taxes on “ sin products ,” such as cigarettes and alcohol, with the goal of deterring undesirable behavior in addition to raising revenue. While Alaska, Delaware, New Hampshire and Oregon have no sales tax, these states levy excise taxes on alcohol and other goods, as illustrated by TaxFoundation.org.\nProperty Tax\nA significant portion of tax revenue for most state and local governments comes from property taxes. Property tax rates also figure heavily in analyses of the best and worst states to live in from a tax perspective, evidenced in a recent analysis by Erin Carlyle for Forbes.com. In 2015, New Jersey had the highest median property tax rate in the nation at 1.89 percent, while Louisiana had the lowest at 0.18 percent. Some states allow homestead exemptions, which may exempt a flat amount of property value from taxation, lowering an owner’s liability.\nState tax codes vary in many ways. In addition to variations in income, sales, excise and property taxes, states may enact different policies for payroll, estate, inheritance, gift and other types of taxes.

Sutton\nTaxing The Rich: A Liberal Argument For A Progressive Tax System To Grow The Economy\nConservatives will play the “class warfare” card if you dare mention a tax increase on the rich. And if you talk about income inequality, well, this means you are simply envious, and you are trying to “punish success.” But for this conservative “logic” to be rational, wouldn’t we have to consider the current progressive tax system to also be unfair? — Well, as it turns out, that is exactly what many conservatives say about progressive taxation, but it doesn’t mean their assessment is sound.\nThere are three big issues conflicting with the simple conservative view that taxes punish success.\n1. You must ignore how tax brackets work.\n2. You have to accept the premise that higher tier incomes are an absolute indicator of success and productivity.\n3. You must fail to understand the decreasing utility of each dollar as you make more dollars.\nSo let’s tackle each of these issues first, saving a moral argument for my closing remarks.\nSO HOW DO THOSE TAX BRACKETS WORK AGAIN?\nThere are a lot of “flat tax” proposals floating around in conservativeland, and the conservatives pitching these plans want us all to know that a flat tax is a fair tax because it treats everyone the same. “[T]hey say, it would simplify paying taxes. Baloney. Flat-tax proposals don’t eliminate popular deductions,” says former labor secretary Robert Reich. Most of the flat tax proposals are not true flat taxes because they typically have deductions, just as the current tax system does. So to the average American, that means filling out forms and filing taxes by April 15th, so nothing much would change, except the small little detail that most of these flat tax proposals reward huge windfalls to the wealthy in the form of lower taxes, usually with the tab being picked up by the poorest tax payers. But even if these flat tax proposals were true flat taxes, there is nothing fair about a poor person paying the same tax rate as a rich person, as I will explain.\n“[T]hey say a flat tax is fairer than the current system because, in [Herman] Cain’s words, a flat tax ‘treats everyone the same.’ The truth is the current tax code treats everyone the same,” says Reich “It’s organized around tax brackets. Everyone whose income reaches the same bracket is treated the same as everyone else whose income reaches that bracket.”\nThis means everyone is treated the same for every dollar that is the same. When a middle-class worker making $40,000 a year earns his 40,000th dollar, it’s taxed at the same rate as the 40,000th dollar earned by a rich person making $4,000,000 a year. People say they are in a tax bracket, when they are more likely in multiple tax brackets. When people refer to their tax bracket, they are referring to the highest bracket for which they pay tax. But everyone pays the same amount of tax for the same amount of money earned. So I’m not exactly sure how you call this unfair, unless you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how tax brackets work, or if deception is a required component of your ideology.\nAnd this means when conservatives decry the tens of millions of Americans who don’t pay federal income taxes, these conservatives are either uninformed, or they intend to use ignorance as means to a deceptive end. First, even if someone is not paying federal income taxes, they are still paying state and local taxes, sales tax, gas tax, and if they are so lucky, real estate taxes. Second, the reason people don’t pay federal income taxes is because they make too little.\n“No one pays any income taxes on the first $20,000 or so of their income,” says Reich. Make sure that sinks in. Reich is saying that no one (and that includes the rich) pays any tax on that first $20,000 of income (give or take depending on deductions and current tax law). So the rich are getting the same benefit (if you want to call it that) the poor are getting, it’s just that the poor wind up paying no tax because their income cuts off well before that of the rich person. The poor person should be so lucky as to be able to have an income high enough to qualify for the luxury of paying federal income tax.\nSo you still aren’t sure how income tax brackets work?\nBelow is a modified tax bracket table. These are not the real brackets, but instead simplified for the purpose of this explanation.\nLet’s say we have these two tax brackets:\nTax Rate - Taxable Income\n.....25% - $0 to $50,000\n.....30% - $50,001 to $100,000\nLet’s apply a common misconception using the above table, and for the sake of simplification, let’s assume there are no deductions and your entire income is subject to federal income tax.\nSo let’s say your name is Bob and you make $50,000. By referring to the above tax table we can see that you are currently paying a 25% tax rate. That means you owe $12,500 in federal income taxes. Now let’s say you’ve done great work this year, so your boss is giving you a raise of $2,500. But oh no! That raise will put you in the 30% tax bracket! Your new salary is $52,500, which means at 30%, you will now owe $15,750 in federal taxes! WTF? That’s $3,250 more in taxes! That wipes out your raise and then some! Oh the humanity! God damn it, conservatives were right, we ARE being punished for success!\nWell, just a second there, professor. Because that’s not how tax brackets work. In the above scenario, because the first tax bracket ends at $50,000, that means the first $50,000 in income would be taxed at 25%. Any income over that amount would then be taxed at 30%, which in this case means the $2,500 raise is taxed at 30%. That means you ACTUALLY owe $13,250, which is only $750 more. ($50,000 x .25 = $12,500) and ($2,500 x .30 = $750) So you still kept $1,750 of that $2,500 raise. You are not being punished for success, but conservatives count on this common misconception to sell economic policies that benefit only the rich.\nDOES MONEY EQUAL SUCCESS?\nIf increasing taxes on the rich means punishing success, then it’s not unreasonable to assume conservatives equate money with success. On one level this obviously is true, that is, if you are measuring success as a dollar figure. But the problem for conservatives is when they start using “productivity” and “success” interchangeably. Remember Mitt Romney’s “ 47 percent ” comment, or how about makers vs. takers, or the idea that there is a “productive” class and a “non-productive” class? All of these are examples of pitting so-called “productive” and “successful” people against so-called “unproductive” and “unsuccessful” people. But what is success? What is productivity? And who’s productivity is responsible for that success? Can these words be used interchangeably?\nIn conservativeland, money equals success, but money also equals productivity. For conservatives, it’s an oversimplified set of human capital equations. — Greater productivity leads to greater money leads to greater success. Lesser productivity leads to lesser money leads to lesser success. — Simple right? Of course, you have to ignore that it takes the combined productivity of all low and middle-income workers to produce the widget that makes the “productive” and “successful” CEO a lot of money. So to use faulty conservative logic, we could say taxing low and middle-income workers is also punishing success. Except those workers aren’t feeling so successful in our modern “trickle down” economy, tax or no tax.\nWHEN YOU MAKE MORE DOLLARS, EACH DOLLAR HAS LESS RELATIVE VALUE\nA dollar is a dollar, right? Well, it is true from a monetary perspective that each dollar is worth, well, a dollar. But the “utility” value of each dollar is not equal, and is entirely dependent on your income level. “Utility is a measure for the degree of happiness or benefit something of value gives you,” says CTLawGuy on DemocraticUnderground. “[T]he more you have of something, the less utility value each additional unit carries. This is called ‘diminishing returns.'”\nThere is a set cost of living that is the same for every person (allowing for geographical variations), regardless of whether you make $40,000 a year or $4,000,000 a year. Gas costs the same, milk costs the same, electricity costs the same, and rent costs the same. Yes, the rich person can “afford” a bigger place and therefore a bigger rent, but we are talking about basic cost of living, and that does not include luxuries such as a larger crib. But even though the basic cost of living is the same dollar amount for every person, this amount causes varying levels of “pain” depending on income level. Let’s say the basic cost of living is roughly $20,000 a year. That is 50% (half) of a $40,000 income, but it’s only 5% of a $400,000 income and only 0.5% of a $4,000,000 income. This is “the decreasing utility value of money,” says CTLawGuy. “If we want to maximize society’s standard of living, we need not to equalize the percentage of income people pay in taxes, but rather to try to equalize the utility burden borne by each income bracket. This means charging the rich a greater percentage of their income, and probably charging the poorer person less of a percentage.”\nAND THEN THERE’S THE MORAL ARGUMENT\nThe rich do not live in a vacuum. They are as much a product of our society and economic system as anyone else. The difference is that a rich person was able to gain an advantage in one or more areas where a poor person was not. But this was only made possible by living in a free and civil society, and that comes at a cost. A progressive tax is one of those costs. A progressive tax is one of the prices we pay for a civil society.\n“A person can work extremely hard and try their best to start a business or get a good job,” s ays Secularist10 on Hubpages. “But if that person is illiterate and has received no formal education, and if he lives in a country with no electricity, rampant crime, and no paved roads, bridges, trains or airports, no matter how hard he works, it will be almost impossible for him to amass significant wealth.”\nThis is similar to the passionate speech by Elizabeth Warren when running for Senate in Massachusetts. “There is nobody in this country who got rich on their own. Nobody,” said Warren. “You built a factory out there – good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. — You built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea – God bless! Keep a hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.”\nThe idea here is that regardless of the amount of hard work an entrepreneur puts into a start-up business, that business would not be possible in a place like Afghanistan. It is the economic and social fabric we’ve woven in the United States, and in other first-world democracies, that makes it possible to start a business, become successful, and make a lot of money.\nBut economic policies over the past several decades have allowed for massive inequality in both wealth and incomes. We don’t expect to have a perfectly equal society, but economic growth after the Great Recession is sluggish in part because of the reduced purchasing power of the middle class. If we keep believing a billionaire is worth every last dollar, it makes it easier to squeeze the poor and middle class, keep their wages stagnant, all to appease stockholders and line the pockets of wealthy executives. And if businesses will not step up to the plate and address the problem of inequality, and so far they have demonstrated willful ignorance, then government must do what it can for the health of the country to build a more stable economy, with a robust middle class.\nNobody is saying you can’t get rich. If you start a business and that business makes you a lot of money, I say kudos to you. But it is unacceptable for people to be out of work and starving in the wealthiest nation on the planet. And adding to that insult is the claim that we are trying to punish success or wage a class war because we propose a tax increase to ease the suffering. That there is suffering means we are not doing everything we could be doing. And yes, it will come at a cost. And I don’t know about you, but on my pain-o-meter, the cost of allowing people to starve is registering much higher than the cost of a tax increase on the rich.\nConscience of a Liberal • Economy • Government • Politics • Tax Fairness • Wealth Inequality\n#conservative #economic growth #federal #income tax #liberal #middle class #poor #progressive #progressive tax #progressive taxation #rich #tax bracket #wealthy", "Economist's View: The Fairness of Progressive Taxation\nEconomist's View\n« Wall Street's \"Performance-Enhancement\" Scandals | Main | Former CEA Chairs and the Unsustainable Budget Deficit »\nThursday, March 24, 2011\nThe Fairness of Progressive Taxation\nChris Dillow defends progressive taxation:\nThe fairness of 50p, by Chris Dillow: Over in the twitterverse, a Very  British Dude has asked whether I think it reasonable to confiscate by force more  than half of someone’s marginal earnings. ... I’d suggest three possible answers here, which vary  in force depending upon the precise type of the rich:\n1. A high tax is a dividend, paid to the state in return for its investment in  the things that made you rich.\nEven if the state did not educate you, the chances are that it educated your  colleagues and customers, whose education benefits you. The state has provided  the domestic peace that has enabled the economy to grow and thus give you the  chance to get rich; very few of the UK’s top earners would be so rich had they  been born in sub-Saharan Africa. It has provided laws - such as patents and  copyright protection - that allow artists and entrepreneurs to profit from their  efforts and talent. And in various ways the state helps to sustain capitalism and hence profits and high earnings.\nWhy shouldn’t it demand payment for such benefits?\n2. The state’s force is a form of countervailing power. Some (many?) of the rich  owe their fortune to the fact that they are powerful. Most egregiously, this  power consists of an ability to extract cash from the state. When the government  taxes bankers or the bosses of BAe, Serco or Capita, it is merely getting its  money back.\nIn other cases, high earnings come from a power to extract rents from either  shareholders or workers... In these cases, state  power corrects for private power.\n3. Inequality is a form of market failing. Imagine we were all behind  a veil of  ignorance, not knowing what talents we’d be born with. Isn’t it plausible  that, behind such a veil, people would agree to enter into insurance contracts  such that if they got lucky or talented they would pay out to the unlucky and  untalented? People would, surely, agree to pay out a proportion of the £1m-plus  a year they would earn as Premiership footballers in order to soften the misery  of being born with no marketable skills.\nYou can therefore regard redistributive taxation as, in effect, the sort of  insurance payments that would be made, if such contracts were  feasible. In  this sense, the tax merely fills in for the missing market.\nThese arguments do not get us to a precise tax rate. But they do suggest a case  for some degree of progressivity in the taxes.\nAnd let’s be clear. A 50p tax is not massively progressive. Overall revenues are  equal to just over 37% of GDP. Under a purely proportionate tax system, then, we  would all pay 37% of our income. ... Expecting a  tiny proportion to pay 50% (yes, for some the marginal rate is 62%, but the  average rate is lower than this) strikes me as not wholly unreasonable.\nPosted by Mark Thoma on Thursday, March 24, 2011 at 10:08 AM in Economics, Equity, Income Distribution, Taxes | Permalink Comments (154)", "Income Inequality, Tax Policy, and Economic Growth - Biswas - 2017 - The Economic Journal - Wiley Online Library\nThe Economic Journal\nConference Paper\nIncome Inequality, Tax Policy, and Economic Growth\nSiddhartha Biswas, Indraneel Chakraborty, Rong Hai\nFirst published: 24 May 2017\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/ecoj.12485\nCitations: 16\nWe thank the Editor Morten Ravn, three anonymous referees, Scott Ashworth, Gerald Auten, Christopher Berry, Dan Black, Stéphane Bonhomme, Naijia Guo, James J.

Taxation at different points of the income distribution has heterogeneous impacts on households’ incentives to work, invest, and consume. Using US state-level data and micro-level household tax returns over the last three decades, we find that reducing income inequality between low and median income households improves economic growth. However, reducing income inequality through taxation between median and high-income households reduces economic growth. These asymmetric economic growth effects are attributable both to supply-side factors (i.e. changes in small business activity and labour supply) and to consumption demand.\nCiting Literature\nSupporting Information\nFilename\nDescription\necoj12485-sup-0001-AppendicesA-E.pdf PDF document, 250 KB\nAppendix A.

The fiscal policy approach argues that inequality is linked to pressure for redistributionary taxation, leading to low capital investment and, therefore, growth. Empirical analyses are consonant with this view in that the long-run relationship between inequality and growth is negative. However, several empirical inconsistencies with the fiscal policy approach do emerge: (a) there exists a short-run, positive relationship between income inequality and growth and (b) the relationship between inequality and taxation is mixed, at best. This paper presents a simple theoretical model that reconciles the intuitively appealing fiscal policy approach with the empirical findings.\nIntroduction\nMuch recent research in the area of economic growth has focused on the role played by income distribution in the growth process. In what has been referred to as the fiscal policy approach to modeling the relationship between inequality and growth, Perotti (1993 ), Alesina and Rodrik (1994 ), and Persson and Tabellini (1994) propose the following framework: greater income inequality leads to populist pressure for redistribution via distortionary taxation, thereby lowering capital investment and growth (see Perotti (1996) and Bénabou (1996b) for excellent surveys). Each of these papers relies on the median voter theorem to obtain its results. If income is unequally distributed, but the political process is open to all, the median voter will cast the decisive vote. In equilibrium, if the median individual has an income below the mean, a redistributionary policy will be favored. 1\nInitial empirical work tested the implied reduced form relationship between inequality and growth using a cross-section of countries (e.g. Persson and Tabellini (1994 ); Alesina and Rodrik (1994 ); Weede (1997 )). The results supported the claim of a negative relationship between inequality and growth. However, these works did not test the internal predictions of the fiscal policy approach, those relating inequality to taxation and taxation to growth. Perotti (1996) fills this gap. Using similar cross-sectional data, the author affirms a negative relationship between inequality and growth but finds no statistically significant effect of inequality on taxation and a positive relationship between taxation and growth. 2\nSeveral theories have been put forth in an attempt to reconcile the fiscal policy approach with Perotti’s (1996) empirical results. Bénabou (1996a ), Saint-Paul and Verdier (1996 ), and Lee and Roemer (1998) rely on imperfections in the political process to obtain empirically consistent results. In particular, these papers depart from the democratic principle of one person, one vote and show that if the median voter is richer than the median individual, inequality and taxation may be negatively related. To explain the positive relationship between taxes and growth, researchers have relied on what is commonly referred to as the credit market approach to model the relationship between inequality and growth. Galor and Zeira (1993 ), for example, posit that with imperfect credit markets, the poor may not be able to afford productive human capital investments. Redistribution may overcome inadequacies in credit markets and increases growth through the greater accumulation of human capital by the poor.\nThese theoretical contributions have not, unfortunately, put the issue of the connection between inequality and growth to rest. More recent empirical work has questioned several of Perotti’s (1996) results. In contrast to Perotti’s finding that inequality and the level of taxation are independent, Milanovic (2000) finds a positive relationship using survey data from mostly European countries. 3 Moreover, recent studies also provide support for an overall positive relationship between inequality and growth. Barro (2000) uses a broad panel of countries and finds that inequality is negatively related to growth for poor countries but not for rich countries. Li and Zou (1998) and Forbes (2000) find a positive relationship between inequality and growth (see also Millimet et al. (2008 )). Forbes (2000) uses a panel of high quality country data and argues that the results indicate a positive relationship only over the short and medium term, thus not contradicting Perotti’s (1996) claim of a negative relationship over the long term.\nThe goal of the present paper is to offer a simple model that relies neither on restrictions on the political participation of agents nor on imperfect credit markets yet is consistent with the following empirical findings: (a) a long-term negative relationship between inequality and growth; (b) a short-term positive relationship between inequality and growth; and, (c) an ambiguous relationship between inequality and taxation. We posit a two-period, overlapping generations model based on Persson and Tabellini (1994 ). According to the model, income inequality originates from an unequal distribution of skills (with the median skill level lying below the mean skill level). The political process is unrestricted—all agents are assumed to participate. Thus, the median voter’s (individual’s) preferences for taxation ultimately determine the tax rate.\nThe model departs from that of Persson and Tabellini (1994) in that restrictions related to the timing of the political process are relaxed. This alteration enables rich agents, those with income above the mean, to act strategically in order to ensure that the median voter prefers a lower tax rate. In particular, the rich may overconsume in the current period to avoid appropriation of income in the subsequent period. This overconsumption, or undersaving, results in no (or low) redistribution, a diminished capital stock, and lower growth than would arise in an economy in which taxation were not possible. Thus, the predictions of the basic model (assuming perfect foresight) are consistent with the reduced form relationship between inequality and growth in Persson and Tabellini (1994 ).\nIn the absence of perfect information, however, several alternative outcomes are possible, as the wealthy act based on the expected incomes of the poor. As long as the expectations of the wealthy are correct, the rich, on average, will overconsume the correct amount. As a result, consistent with Perotti (1996) and other cross-sectional analyses, the model predicts a long-term negative relationship between inequality and growth, even under this type of uncertainty.\nHowever, the calculations of the rich are correct only in expectation; in any given period, the wealthy may fail to overconsume a sufficient amount (under-overconsume) or they may overconsume more than necessary (over-overconsume). In the former case, the initial inequality results in higher taxes and higher growth relative to the perfect information case. Under the latter scenario, the initial inequality results in lower taxes and lower growth relative to the perfect information case. Recognizing that either outcome is feasible in any given period, the model predicts a negative relationship between inequality and growth on average (i.e., in the long run) yet allows for the possibility of observing short run positive associations between inequality and growth. The model also provides one possible explanation for the conflicting findings regarding the relationship between inequality and taxation, as inequality may lead either to low taxation or to high taxation.\nWhy might there be uncertainty with regard to the distribution of the returns to skills among the poor? One possibility is a skill-biased technology shock, which lowers the realized income level of the median voter below its expectation. For example, Katz and Murphy (1992 ), Krueger (1993 ), and Autor et al. (1998) emphasize the increase in returns to skill in the U.S. over the 1980s and 1990s, driven in large part by changes in computer-intensive industries. If such shocks are unforeseen (or foreseen but underestimated), the model predicts both higher taxes and higher growth compared to the situation of a perfectly forecasted shock. This type of positive relationship between inequality and taxes is consistent with Milanovic (2000 ), whose sample includes countries likely to have been affected by such technological shocks. It is also consistent with Barro’s (2000) finding of a negative relationship between inequality and growth in poor countries but a positive relationship between inequality and growth in rich countries, as rich countries are more likely to have experienced a skill-biased technology shock.\nThe Model\nConsider a perfect foresight, two-period overlapping generations model with zero population growth. Individuals supply one unit of labor inelastically in the first period, save in the first period, and consume a portion of their income in both periods (Fig. 1 ). There is no bequest motive. Agents have identical, homothetic preferences with a concave, well-behaved utility function, v_t^i = U\\left( {c_{t - 1}^i,d_t^i} \\right) . Where: v_t^i is lifetime utility of individual i born in period t −1; c_{t - 1}^i refers to consumption when young; and d_t^i to consumption when old.\nFig. 1\nOverlapping periods\nFull size image\nThe budget constraints for the i th individual are:\nc_{t - 1}^i + k_t^i = y_{t - 1}^i\n(1 + r)\\left[ {(1 - {\\theta_t})k_t^i + {\\theta_t}{k_t}} \\right] = d_t^i\nwhere: k_t^i is the individual accumulation of capital; kt is the average capital stock in period t; r is the exogenous rate of return on capital; y_{t - 1}^i is first period income; and θ is the tax rate to be voted upon. The model contains no role for productive government expenditure. Taxation is purely redistributive within each older generation—those who saved less than average gain, while those who saved more than average lose. No intergenerational transfers are allowed.\nAn individual’s income is determined by his skill level. All individuals are endowed with an identical set of basic skills, w. High skilled individuals are also endowed with an identical set of advanced skills, {e^{\\overline r }} > {{0}} . Low skilled individuals are endowed with an individual-specific endowment of skills, ei,p, where {e^{i,p}} < {e^{\\overline r }} . Let ei denote the entire set of individual skills {e^{\\overline r }} and ei,p. Assume ei has mean zero, a strictly negative median, and that the distribution is known to all agents. This final assumption will be relaxed below. Figure 2 shows a sample skills distribution. As a result, income earned when young can be expressed as y_{t - 1}^i = (w + {e^i}){k_{t - 1}} (where {k_{t - 1}} is the average capital stock per capita in period t− 1).\nFig. 2\nSkills distribution\nFull size image\nGiven homothetic preferences, all individuals will have identical savings rates. Moreover, highly skilled individuals will have the same level of savings given that their skill set is identical. As a result, the distribution of income and second period wealth are determined by the distribution of ei. Consequently, each generation has an unequal distribution of income and wealth; those with skills and income above average are hereafter denoted as rich (where each rich agent is completely identical assuming identical preferences). Those with skills and income below average are referred to as poor. Because the median skill level is below the average skill level (and similarly median income, ym, below average income, \\overline y ), the poor outnumber the rich. Let the number of rich agents be denoted by R and the number of poor agents be denoted by P (R  <  P ). 4\nThe tax rate, θ, is determined via majority voting in a democratic framework. It is assumed that voters vote only on the issue of taxation, and with single peaked preferences, the median voter’s preferences will determine the outcome in a majority vote (Grandmont (1978 )). Consider a very general democratic framework where individuals are allowed to call a referendum at any time prior to second period consumption. For example, a particular generation could choose to vote at the start of the first period on the tax rate that will be implemented at the beginning of the second period, or the generation could wait and vote at the very beginning of the second period (Fig. 1 ). In addition, more than one referendum may be held if there exists the desire to re-vote. The only restriction placed on the referendum procedure is that the most recent vote prior to second period consumption be binding. In other words, if a referendum is held in the first period, prior to the savings decisions, there exists the possibility of a new referendum at the start of the second period, and this second vote would over-ride the earlier outcome.\nThe possibility of multiple referendum marks a departure from the model in Persson and Tabellini (1994) and Alesina and Rodrik (1994 ). In Persson and Tabellini (1994 ), voting on the tax rate is assumed to occur in the first period, prior to the savings decision, and policy commitment is assumed. The implications from allowing multiple votes on the tax rate, including after savings decisions are made, are discussed in the next section. In contrast to Persson and Tabellini (1994 ), Alesina and Rodrik (1994) permit multiple votes on the tax rate, but because the underlying decision variables in their model are constant, the same tax rate is always preferred. Thus, the timing of the vote is inconsequential.\nTo avoid any constitutional concerns in our model, all people alive—over a certain minimum age—are allowed to vote in a given referendum; however, it is assumed that only those directly affected (i.e., members of the generation whose income will be redistributed according to the outcome of the vote on θ) will actually vote because there are time costs involved with voting, and only those directly involved are affected by the outcome. Even if one argues that children (or parents, depending on when the vote is taken for a particular generation) derive utility from the parents’ (or children’s) well-being and, therefore, choose to vote, given the assumption of constant population, this will not affect the outcome of the referendum since every child (or parent) will vote identically to their parents (or child). Finally, there is no coordination over voting—each individual votes according to his or her individual optimization condition.\nEquilibrium\nThe equilibrium contains two dimensions: one economic and one political. A political equilibrium is defined as the tax policy that cannot be defeated by any alternative tax policy under a majority vote in a referendum prior to second period consumption. To determine the political equilibrium, the i th individual must balance his desire for increased (decreased) redistribution with the realization that this action results in a lower (higher) base for redistribution. Each agent optimizes when these two effects exactly offset. Because the distribution of ei determines the ranking of individual preferences, the equilibrium value θ* is the tax rate preferred by the median voter (Persson and Tabellini (1994 ); Alesina and Rodrik (1994 )). Allowing multiple votes on θ, even after savings decisions have been made, implies that if km  <  k, that is, the median voter is poorer than average, then he prefers a high tax rate \\theta = \\overline \\theta . Otherwise, he prefers a low tax rate \\theta = \\underline \\theta .\nTo determine the economic equilibrium given the possibility of multiple votes on the tax rate and identical rich agents, first consider the case where θ* is zero (an economy without taxation). Under this scenario, all individuals save an amount such that the ratio of the marginal utility of consumption in the second period to the marginal utility of consumption in the first period equals \\frac{\\beta }{{1 + r}} , where β is the discount rate (call this the first best solution). All agents will have the same savings rate, and all rich agents will have the same first period savings level, kr. Denote the differing savings levels of each poor by ki,p.\nNow consider the case where \\theta \\in \\left[ {\\underline \\theta, \\overline \\theta } \\right] is determined by the median voter. If all agents act atomistically, given the unequal distribution of income and the possibility of a tax rate vote after savings is completed, the median voter will vote for the highest tax rate possible. 5 With \\theta = \\overline \\theta , the income of the rich in the second period will be given by (1 + r)\\left[ {\\overline \\theta k + \\left( {1 - \\overline \\theta } \\right){k^r}} \\right] and each rich agent will have foregone income equal to (1 + r)\\left[ {\\theta ({k^r} - k)} \\right] . The rich are aware of this potential outcome. As long as the marginal utility from first period consumption is non-zero, then the rich will alter their consumption pattern in order to maximize their utility. In particular, the rich will overconsume (under save) in the first period by an amount such that median savings km equals average savings k, ensuring that the median voter prefers the lowest tax rate, \\underline \\theta . This over-consume-in-first-period outcome is preferred by the rich because the loss in utility from over consuming in the first period is less than the loss in utility which would be incurred had the highest possible tax rate been implemented. Call this their second best solution.\nEach rich agent is aware of the gain in utility to be had by over consuming in the first period. With perfect information, each rich individual can determine the second best solution by finding the aggregate savings by the rich, KR, that exactly ensures that km  =  k. Given that rich agents are identical, a symmetric equilibrium can be reached: each rich agent will adjust his first period consumption by the same amount. Each rich agent knows that each poor agent will save according to the first order conditions for utility maximization, will have the same savings rate, and that aggregate savings by the poor will be KP. Thus each rich agent learns the value of KR by solving \\frac{{{K^R} + {K^P}}}{{R + P}} = {k^m} . Each rich agent then sets his first period savings level, kr, to KR/R.\nThe poor act atomistically, taking the behavior of the rich as given (because there is perfect information, everyone knows the rich can and will act to avoid high taxation). The poor expect \\theta = \\underline \\theta and act accordingly, as the poor are unable to counteract the actions of the rich. Note that for the poor as a group, either one poor individual would have to reduce first period consumption by \\in ( \\in > {{0}}) to offset the actions of the rich, or all poor agents would have to reduce their first period consumption equally. In the first instance, there is no obvious way to select the one poor person who will under consume. In the latter instance, enforcement would be difficult due to the fact that some poor are at the bottom of the income scale—the subsistence level—and would be unable to under consume. In short, no symmetric equilibrium exists for the poor.\nConsequently, the politico-economic equilibrium with perfect foresight entails the poor behaving under the expectation that \\theta = \\underline \\theta , and the rich acting to ensure {\\theta* } = \\underline \\theta by saving less than if no taxation were possible. The equilibrium is characterized by low taxation and undersaving by those who have incomes above the mean. As a result, the capital stock in the second period is smaller, resulting in lower growth and a negative relationship between inequality and economic growth. While the end conclusion is the same as Persson and Tabellini (1994 ), the mechanism is different. In the present model, it is the threat of high taxation due to inequality and not the taxation itself that is responsible for lower growth.\nWhile the assumption of identical rich agents and heterogeneous poor agents appears restrictive, it is merely a simplification. Each rich agent knows that all rich agents are identical; thus, the equilibrium will be symmetrical. To complicate the model without qualitatively changing the results, the model could be generalized to allow for heterogeneity of skill levels and income among the rich. This diversity, however, would not change the ultimate result. Each rich individual would identify with the rich group; the rich as a group would still alter their consumption pattern in order to maximize their utility. In this case, however, some form of explicit collective action would be necessary to arrive at the welfare enhancing equilibrium. It could be assumed, for example, that the rich have the resources to devote to pre-play communication, while the poor, given their lower incomes, do not. 6\nImperfect Information\nNow consider a situation of imperfect information. In the first period, each agent knows his skill level. All agents are also aware that rich agents are identical. Assume that rich agents know the distribution of the skills of the poor, but they do not know the exact distribution of the return to skills of the poor, just its expected distribution. The rich learn the realized distribution of return to skills for the poor at the beginning of the second period, upon observing the savings behavior of the poor. At that point, all savings decisions, including those by the rich, have been made. Thus, the rich make their savings decisions in the first period without knowledge of the actual distribution of the returns to skills.\nLet E({k^m}) = {k^m} and E({y^{i,p}}) = {y^{i,p}} , where E (∙) denotes the expected value and km and yi,p are the perfect information values for median savings and incomes of the poor, respectively. Thus, on average, {e^m} < \\overline e , \\overline e = {{0}} , and {y^m} < \\overline y . The rich, however, now must maximize their expected utility, E(U ). To arrive at the second-best solution under imperfect information, the rich must solve for KR, such that \\frac{{{K^R} + E({K^P})}}{{R + P}} = E({k^m}) .\nOn average, the rich will be correct in their calculations and the outcome will be the perfect information (second best) outcome. However, the presence of unanticipated shocks may prevent the rich from obtaining the second best solution in any particular instance. We consider two such short-run shocks: mean-income-preserving shocks to the return to skills, and non-mean-income-preserving shocks to the return to skills. Shocks that alter (do not alter) mean income also alter (do not alter) aggregate savings.\nMean-Preserving Shocks\nCase IA.\nConsider a shock to the return to skill, where the shock is not uniform across the skills distribution. The shock does not alter an individual’s endowment of skills, but rather the ability of individuals to map their skills into income. Although there are an infinite number of potential mean-preserving shocks, assume the shock leaves the incomes of the rich unaltered, but widens the income distribution amongst the poor. Furthermore, assume the shock is such that the median voter, while still having a skill level less than the average skill level, now has an income above mean income \\left( {{y^m} > E\\left( {\\overline y } \\right)} \\right) . With this realization, the median voter prefers a low tax regardless of the rich’s actions. Therefore the rich, operating under the expectation that the median voter will prefer a high tax, unnecessarily overconsume (“over-overconsume”) in the first period. Moreover, the amount of consumption diverted to the first period by the rich is identical to the amount diverted under the perfect foresight version of the model. Finally, since the shock is mean-preserving and preferences are homothetic (implying all poor individuals have the same savings rate), aggregate savings by the poor, KP, is the same as if there had been no shock. Thus, the equilibrium is identical to the perfect information (second best) case: lower taxation and lower growth (relative to the case of an economy in which taxation is not possible).\nCase IB.\nConsider the same mean-preserving shock to the return to skill as in Case IA, except the shock reduces the income of the median individual below the expected mean income \\left( {{y^m} < E\\left( {\\overline y } \\right)} \\right) . With this realization, the rich do not overconsume a sufficient amount in the first period (“under-overconsume”) and the median voter still prefers a high tax rate (i.e., even after the rich divert additional income to first-period consumption, ym is still below \\overline y ). As in Case IA, because the aggregate savings amounts of the rich and poor are invariant to this shock, the equilibrium entails greater redistribution, but the same growth as in the perfect information (second best) outcome.\nCombining Cases IA and IB indicate that mean-preserving shocks generate a negative relationship between inequality and growth but an ambiguous association between inequality and taxes (as inequality is consistent with either low or high taxation), consistent with the empirical findings in Perotti (1996) and Milanovic (2000 ).\nNon-Mean-Preserving Shocks\nCase IIA.\nConsider again, as in Case IA., a shock that results in a median income above the expected mean income \\left( {{y^m} > E\\left( {\\overline y } \\right)} \\right) , but now assume that the shock increases the aggregate income of the poor. This non-mean-preserving shock leads to the same over consumption by the rich in the first period as in the perfect foresight (second best) model and a lower tax rate (as the median individual is wealthier than the average individual). However, in contrast to Case IA, because the aggregate savings of the poor rises due to the increase in aggregate income amongst the poor, growth will be greater than in Case IA (and the perfect foresight (second best) case). Thus, the equilibrium entails lower taxes and higher growth, despite the unequal distribution of income.\nCase IIB.\nFinally, consider a shock resulting in an income for the median voter below the expected mean income \\left( {{y^m} < E\\left( {\\overline y } \\right)} \\right) , as in Case IB., but now assume that the shock results in an increase in the aggregate income of the poor. In other words, the shock benefits only a select few in the upper tail of the skills distribution amongst the poor and reduces the income of the median individual below his expected income level. In the presence of such an unforeseen shock, the tax rate preferred by the median voter will be high because the rich have under-overconsumed. Moreover, as in Case IIA, because the aggregate income of the poor has increased, growth will exceed the perfect foresight (second best) outcome. Under this scenario, the equilibrium is characterized by high taxation and higher growth.\nThe outcome outlined in this case corresponds to an unforeseen skill-biased technology shock, more typical of richer, industrialized countries (e.g., Katz and Murphy (1992 ), Krueger (1993 ), and Autor et al. (1998) emphasize the increase in returns to skill in the U.S. over the 1980s and 1990s, driven in large part by changes in computer-intensive industries). Thus, the model’s predictions are consistent with the findings of Milanovic (2000 )—a positive relationship between inequality and taxes in a sample of mostly European countries—and of Barro (2000 )—a positive relationship between inequality and growth in a sample of richer countries. Furthermore, Cases IIA and IIB indicate (as did Cases IA and IB), that income inequality is consistent with both low and high levels of taxation. Finally, Cases IIA and IIB indicate that inequality may be positively related to growth in the short term (as in Forbes (2000 )). Table 1 summarizes the results obtained from the four imperfect information scenarios, as well as the results from the perfect information setting.\nTable 1 Theoretical Predictions\nFull size table\nConclusion\nThis paper presents a simple model that reconciles the fiscal policy approach to modeling income inequality and economic growth with recent empirical tests of the theory. The original fiscal policy literature argued that inequality leads to greater redistribution, thereby discouraging capital investment and resulting in stagnant growth. While recent empirical work confirms a negative relationship between inequality and growth in the long term, a positive relationship is found in the short run. Additionally, the evidence regarding the intermediate link in the chain of causation—between inequality and taxation—has been mixed.\nTo reconcile the fiscal policy approach with these empirical findings, we present a model that relaxes the political set-up utilized in previous models of this type. Unlike these previous models that rely on deviations from the one person, one vote principle, or on imperfections in credit markets to explain one or more of the empirical results, our model liberalizes the voting process by allowing multiple referenda to be called and makes no restrictive assumptions regarding credit markets. Instead, the model relies on the ability of the wealthy to influence the median voter’s preferences regarding redistribution. When we introduce uncertainty into the model, the model is able to generate outcomes wholly consistent with the empirical findings. Specifically, the model is able to explain the long-term negative relationship between inequality and growth, while also allowing for a possible short-run positive relationship. Furthermore, the model predicts an ambiguous relationship between inequality and redistribution, thus providing one possible explanation for the inconsistent empirical results found with regards to the internal mechanism of the fiscal policy approach.\nNotes\n1.\nNote that the fiscal policy approach ignores dynamic issues such as the impact of expected future income mobility on preferences for redistribution (Bénabou and Ok (2001 ); Lambert et al. (2003 ); Quadrini (1999 ); Ravallion and Lokshin (2000 )).\n2.\nPerotti (1996) uses a simultaneous equations approach to rule out potential reverse causation explanations, such as high growth countries preferring greater redistribution if inequality aversion is a normal good (Lambert et al. (2003 )).\n3.\nThe non-European countries in the sample are Australia, Canada, Israel, Taiwan, Russia and the US.\n4.\nOther mechanisms have been used to recognize group heterogeneity. For example, in Alesina and Drazen’s (1991) war of attrition model, the rich and poor incur different costs when stabilization is delayed. Laban and Sturzenegger (1994) assume that the rich have access to a “financial adaptation technology” (off-shore accounts), while the poor do not.\n5.\nIn the extreme, all wealth would be appropriated (θ  = 1). We assume, however, that the highest tax rate, \\overline \\theta , is less than one and depends on country-specific norms. Alternatively, one could complicate the model by incorporating the possibility of upward mobility between periods. As a result, the median voter may prefer a tax rate less than one if there is a possibility he may end up wealthier than average in the second period. We abstract from such issues at this time.\n6.\nIf a collective action argument were to be relied upon, the idea that wealthy individuals may be able to act collectively to achieve a common goal, while the poor are unable, is not new. Olson (1965) argues that certain sub-groups of the population are better able to organize collectively. This logic has been used to explain how the wealthy are able to avoid the location of pollution-generating activities and hazardous waste sites in areas in which they reside (e.g., Brooks and Sethi (1997 ); Arora and Cason (1999 )). Elster (1989) and Ostrom (1998) emphasize the vital role played by social norms in the provision of public goods. Additionally, a more complicated alternative model could have the rich acting collectively in order to provide a public good—the absence of redistribution.\nThe solution here parallels the command optimum solution of Fischer (1980) where, if the private sector acts cooperatively, taxes on capital will be low; if they act non-cooperatively, taxes on capital will be high. That is, Fischer (1980) shows that if the private sector is induced to save the right amount in the first period, the command optimum is attainable.\nReferences\nAlesina, A., & Drazen, A. (1991).

Part 3. Income Redistribution via Taxes and Transfers Across OECD Countries\nTaxes and transfers reduce inequality in disposable income relative to market income. The effect varies, however, across OECD countries. The redistributive impact of taxes and transfers depends on the size, mix and the progressivity of each component. Some countries with a relatively small tax and welfare system (e.g. Australia) achieve the same redistributive impact as countries characterised by much higher taxes and transfers (e.g. Germany) because they rely more on income taxes, which are more progressive than other taxes, and on means-tested cash transfers. This paper provides an assessment of the redistributive effect of the main taxes and cash transfers based on a set of policy indicators and a literature review. It also identifies empirically four groups of countries with tax and transfer systems that share broadly similar features. The paper then assesses potential trade-offs and complementarities between economic growth and income redistribution objectives associated with various tax and transfer reform options.\nEnglish\nMore On\nKeywords: cluster analysis, welfare system, income inequality, redistribution, taxes, transfers\nJEL: H53: Public Economics / National Government Expenditures and Related Policies / Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs;\nH2: Public Economics / Taxation, Subsidies, and Revenue;\nH23: Public Economics / Taxation, Subsidies, and Revenue / Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities; Redistributive Effects; Environmental Taxes and Subsidies;\nI38: Health, Education, and Welfare / Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty / Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Policy; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs;\nI3: Health, Education, and Welfare / Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty\nYou have access to all online formats\nCITE THIS PAPER\nEMAIL THIS PAGE\nAuthor(s)\nIsabelle Joumard , Mauro Pisu and Debra Bloch OECD\n10 Jan 2012\n67 pages\nNo. 926\nhttps://doi.org/10.1787/5k9h296b1zjf-en", "Does tax structure affect economic growth?

In contrast to previous studies, we do not find a robust ranking of different types of taxes in terms of their \"growth effects\". In particular, we do not obtain compelling evidence favouring consumption taxes over income taxes, or favouring personal income taxes over corporate income taxes. The only robust result appears to be that shifts in tax revenue towards property taxes are associated with a higher level of income per capita in the long run.\nSuggested Citation\nJing Xing, 2011.\n \"Does tax structure affect economic growth?

We explore this question by assessing the impact of various mechanisms for raising government revenues on investment, growth, and income distribution in 22 developed market economy countries. The article considers whether growth and distribution are affected differently by governments' relative reliance on personal and corporate income taxes, social security contributions, property taxes, and sales and value added taxes, or by the relative progressivity of tax mechanisms. Our findings lend support to the assertion that fiscal instruments (especially personal income taxes) can be used successfully to achieve greater income equality. On the other hand, these findings run counter to the conventional notion that an automatic trade-off exists between an active public sector and a dynamic, expanding economy: although there is surely some tension between the economic goals of growth and equality, it is not at all clear that they are necessarily incompatible or that government can contribute only to the latter.\nType\nResearch Article\nInformation\nAmerican Political Science Review , Volume 77 , Issue 4, December 1983, pp. 871 - 886\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.2307/1957563\nCopyright\nCopyright © American Political Science Association 1983\nReferences\nBlalock, H.

Existing literatures find either a positive or a negative relationship. In this paper, we attempt to theoretically examine that relationship with a stochastic optimal growth model. We make the disagreement clear within a single model. We conclude (i) that both are possible – that is, higher inequality can retard growth in the early stage of economic development, and can encourage growth in a near steady state, (ii) that income redistribution by high income tax does not always reduce income inequality. Income inequality can be reduced by higher income tax in a near steady state, but it cannot be reduced in the early stage of economic development, and (iii) that two government polices – rapid economic growth and low income inequality – can be achieved by low income tax in the early stage of economic development, but both cannot be achieved simultaneously in a near steady state.\nKeywords: Income inequality; Economic growth; Progressive tax; Transition dynamics; Asset distribution (search for similar items in EconPapers)\nJEL-codes: E64 H23 O47 (search for similar items in EconPapers)\nDate: 2012\nReferences: View references in EconPapers View complete reference list from CitEc\nCitations: View citations in EconPapers (42) Track citations by RSS feed\nDownloads: (external link)\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999312000466\nFull text for ScienceDirect subscribers only\nRelated works:\nWorking Paper: Income Inequality and Economic Growth (2008)\nThis item may be available elsewhere in EconPapers: Search for items with the same title.\nExport reference: BibTeX RIS (EndNote, ProCite, RefMan) HTML/Text\nPersistent link: https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:ecmode:v:29:y:2012:i:5:p:2049-2057\nDOI: 10.1016/j.econmod.2012.02.011\nAccess Statistics for this article\nEconomic Modelling is currently edited by S.

Free market economic ideology is based on the premise that constraining “the market” through policies such as increased taxes is bad for economic growth.1 Yet the economy is not perfectly represented by abstract theoretical models. Empirical studies based on real-world data are often unable to find these negative growth effects. Because neoclassical economic models consistently fail to accurately predict economic growth patterns, policymakers need to rethink using them to analyze tax changes.\nThe relationship between taxation and U.S. economic growth Download\nResearchers have studied many different fluctuations in U.S. tax policy over the past several decades. In 1997, for example, the United States had much higher average tax rates and especially much higher rates of taxation on wealth and capital than it does today. 2 Recent years have seen the passage of a major tax cut in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and new proposals from the Biden administration to raise revenue from the richest Americans.3\nThis issue brief examines if, in recent U.S. economic history, there is empirical evidence linking economic growth and:\nThe broad tax regime\nTop individual income tax rates\nCorporate tax rates\nCapital taxation\nU.S. income and wealth inequality\nIn light of the evidence surveyed, the brief closes by discussing the proper way for policymakers to judge and evaluate tax proposals. Because classical models lack strong explanatory power in practice, U.S. policymakers should not focus on economic growth as an outcome in tax policy formulation. Rather, they should focus on the actual, meaningful, and measurable effects of tax changes, such as their impact on government revenues and the distribution of income.\nTax evasion and economic inequality\nEven classical economic models are unlikely to assume that proposals to raise revenue by combatting tax evasion would hurt U.S. economic growth. Tax evasion introduces inequities and inefficiencies into the tax system. To the extent that policymakers can cut down on evasion, this can reduce inequality and raise valuable revenue to invest in American families.

Unlike the Keynesian model used in the mid-20th century, which had very little to say about taxes, supply-side economics and other neoclassical models champion a “free market”-centered view that frames taxes as the enemy of economic growth. 4\nIn the 1980s, policymakers followed these models and drastically lowered the top individual marginal income tax rate, from about 70 percent down to 28 percent, and lowered the top corporate rate from 46 percent down to 34 percent. 5 But instead of booming, income growth slowed. As the government reduced statutory tax rates, especially for those at the top, inequality exploded, and income growth rates went down. (See Figure 1.)\nFigure 1\nDrawing definitive conclusions from these types of correlations is not possible because there is no counterfactual. But it is clear that the U.S. economy grew more slowly after top rates were drastically lowered than it had grown previously.\nThe Congressional Research Service also finds that broad empirical data are the opposite of what neoclassical models predict. The U.S. national savings rate, for example, declined in the 1980s after taxes on capital dropped, and it again declined after capital tax cuts in the 1990s and 2000s; neoclassical models predict the opposite would happen.\nAdditionally, U.S. labor supply, measured by the number of hours worked, has broadly declined as top personal income tax rates have declined; neoclassical models would likewise predict the opposite. Again, there is no counterfactual, but even subcomponents of growth—in these cases, savings rates and labor supply—have behaved the opposite way free market, or supply-side, economists would predict. 6\nIn addition, Chye-Ching Huang of New York University and Nathaniel Frentz of the Congressional Budget Office produce a review of dozens of peer-reviewed studies on the relationship between taxation and economic growth in 2014 and find that the academy was highly conflicted. “Taking all of these studies into account, there is simply no consensus that, as a general proposition, cutting taxes is a good strategy to boost economic growth,” they report. 7 More recent evidence has not changed this conclusion, as detailed below.\nTop individual income tax rate and U.S. economic growth\nThe current top marginal income tax rate is 37 percent, or up to 40.8 percent for some taxpayers when combined with two Medicare surtaxes. The Biden administration offered proposals to raise the top rate back to 39.6 percent, where it was for most of the 1990s and 2010s. 8 Analysts who rely on neoclassical models argue that there are large trade-offs between having a strongly progressive tax system and economic growth. 9 But this theoretical trade-off is not apparent in the economic literature.10\nA tax and economic growth trade-off also is not present in the data. Over time, there has been no obvious relationship between U.S. economic growth and the top marginal rate applied to individuals’ regular income. (See Figure 2.)\nFigure 2\nIn fact, over time, high top rates are correlated with higher economic growth for most Americans, according to research from University of California, Berkeley economist Emanuel Saez. His research on the effects of the Obama administration’s 2013 tax increases on individual taxpayers making more than $250,000 per year concludes that they were efficient at raising revenue and “the top tax rate increases of 1993 and 2013 do not seem to have hurt overall economic growth, quite the contrary.” 11\nSaez finds that “the best growth years for the bottom 99% incomes since 1990 have taken place in the mid to late 1990s and since 2013, shortly after increases in top tax rates.” On individual rates, the empirical pattern has been the opposite of what neoclassical models predict, casting doubt on these models’ ability to say anything meaningful about growth following tax increases on the rich.\nCorporate rate cuts have not boosted U.S. economic growth\nThe biggest recent test case for the theory that tax rates have strong effects on economic growth was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Among other changes, this law lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. At the time, the Trump administration’s Council of Economic Advisers claimed that “reductions in effective corporate tax rates have substantial, positive short- and long-run effects on output,” primarily by increasing “firms’ investment, desired capital stock, and potential output,” which would lead to “wage increases for U.S. households of $4,000 or more” and “much of this boost to U.S. output may be apparent in the near term.” 12\nAs many analysts confirm, these predictions did not occur. Steve Rosenthal at the Tax Policy Center reports that even a full 2 years after passage, the United States was “without resulting investment or wage growth, or even green shoots.” 13\nThe 2017 tax cuts’ lack of effect on wages in its first 2 years surprised few analysts, but the law’s lack of effect on corporate investment was particularly striking. While investment can be volatile, the Congressional Research Service notes that the biggest bump in investment since its passage occurred in the first half of 2018, too early to be the plausible result of a tax change just months before because investment decisions take time to plan and execute. 14\nMoreover, the Congressional Research Service finds that investment increases (such as they were) were in subcategories that didn’t correspond to the provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For instance, intellectual property investment grew fastest in 2018, even though the law paradoxically raised the user cost of investing in intellectual property, with factors other than tax cuts driving those changes. 15\nIndeed, there was strong growth in fixed investment in the year before the 2017 tax cuts passed, which carried over into 2018 before stagnating in 2019. This is despite the long and sustained fall in tax revenue, which began dropping in 2017 as corporations used accounting techniques to ensure losses would start appearing the year before the new rates hit to take full advantage of the cut. (See Figure 3.)\nFigure 3\nSo, what did corporations spend their large tax cut on, if not wages or investment? Analysts at the International Monetary Fund find that 80 percent of the corporate tax cuts were repurposed into stock buybacks and dividends, which overwhelmingly benefited wealthy shareholders. 16 And Lenore Palladino of the University of Massachusetts Amherst documents that these corporate buybacks and dividends also widened the racial wealth divide, finding that White stock-owners hold $27 for every $1 in corporate equity and mutual fund value held by a Black or Hispanic stock-owner. 17\nThe main effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act were less government revenue and regressive tax cuts for corporations, wealthy shareholders, and executives who bear nearly all the burden of corporate taxes even as the rate changes had little effect on business investment or workers. 18\nCapital taxation and U.S. economic growth\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the United States significantly reduced the taxation of capital. For instance, the top capital gains rate was lowered from 28 percent in 1997 to 15 percent in 2003, before being raised back to 20 percent, plus a 3.8 percent Medicare surcharge, in the early 2010s. Meanwhile, taxes on dividends were reduced from nearly 40 percent down to the capital gains rate of 15 percent in 2003.\nThere are often confounding factors that make it difficult for data to precisely show what effect a tax change has on the economy, but occasionally, natural experiments do arise. The 2003 dividend rate cut provides an ideal test case to measure the effect of a capital tax cut on growth. Equitable Growth grantee and UC Berkeley economist Danny Yagan (now at the White House Office of Management and Budget) compares the behavior of C-corporations, which experienced the dividend tax rate drop from nearly 40 percent to 15 percent, to other, similar businesses (S-corporations) that were not affected by the tax cut to demonstrate why only shareholders gained from those dividend cuts. 19 (See Figure 4.)\nFigure 4\nSimilar to the pattern after the 2017 tax cuts passed, Yagan finds that the main effect of the dividend tax cut was that C-corporations increased payments to their shareholders. C-corporations did not increase employee compensation or investment after they received their tax cut, when compared to unaffected S-corporations. Contrary to claims from the law’s proponents and neoclassical economic models, cutting dividend taxes more than in half did not boost economic growth but did reduce government revenue and increase inequality.\nU.S. income and wealth inequality and growth\nCutting taxes for the owners of businesses and other forms of capital rarely had perceptible effects on investment or economic growth, but these cuts still have economic effects. Because capital income is so unequally distributed, lowering business and investment tax rates creates an upward income redistribution, enriching the already-wealthy. (See Figure 5.)\nFigure 5\nWhile there is no discernable positive correlation between upper-income tax cuts and U.S. economic growth, there is a clear correlation between these tax cuts and income inequality. When the United States began lowering top marginal income rates and taxes on capital income, such as investments, corporations, and other businesses, the income of the richest 1 percent of U.S. families grew. The 1980s were a period with many economic and policy changes besides tax cuts for the wealthy, so tax cuts cannot be said to be completely responsible for this trend, though they contributed. (See Figure 6.)\nFigure 6\nLow taxes on accumulated wealth also help the already-wealthy and powerful maintain and grow their privilege over other Americans. Wealth inequality is growing.20 Refusing to tax these gains helps the beneficiaries of past policy choices maintain their economic and social power, even when past wealth was gained in a context of racist and sexist economic structures. 21 (See Figure 7.)\nFigure 7\nIn general, neoclassical economic models have neglected economic inequality as a driver of slowing growth, decreasing dynamism, and stagnating well-being over the past several decades, argues Heather Boushey in her most recent book Unbound: How Inequality Constricts Our Economy and What We can Do About It. Boushey finds that lowering taxes at the top helped to fuel the rise of inequality, which has obstructed, subverted, and distorted the pathways to broadly shared growth.\nPost-1980, economic policymaking focused more on allowing the already-wealthy to keep more and more gains, meaning this wealth has not “trickled down” or been reinvested in ways that build growth for middle- and lower-income Americans. This also starved the public sector of resources to build structures that lift up those who have been systemically disadvantaged historically. The result is that public investment has fallen, and the top 1 percent benefits disproportionately from the slower economic growth the United States is still experiencing. 22\nThe economy is complex, and there are many factors that determine growth and well-being that short-run neoclassical models fail to capture. For instance, the returns from many investments in children and families are so high that they outweigh the plausible economic benefits claimed by tax cut boosters, says the former Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Board Alan Blinder. 23 This is the crucial part of analyzing a tax that many models undervalue: the benefits from the spending that taxes enable.\nTo the extent policymakers judge economic policy on its “growth” effects, they should consider who benefits from the growth that occurs. 24\nHow policymakers should judge tax changes\nSo, how should policymakers judge proposed taxes if the data on tax changes rarely reflect classical analyses’ predictions? The answer, as former Equitable Growth Tax Policy Director Greg Leiserson writes, is “ if U.S. tax reform delivers equitable growth, a distribution table will show it .” 25 A revenue analysis explains how much money will be collected or lost, and a distribution analysis explains who will pay for or benefit from the tax. Numerous complex calculations and assumptions underlie the production of revenue and distribution tables, but when done well, they provide the key information that policymakers need to know about how tax changes will impact the populations they care about.\nAnalyses of taxes’ effects on economic growth, while often sparking interesting academic debates, do not tell policymakers anything they cannot learn by looking at a revenue analysis and a distribution table produced by rigorous, nonpartisan groups such as the U.S. Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy Center.26\nConclusion\nThis issue brief shows that while tax changes can have large effects on the U.S. economy, they have not noticeably affected overall economic growth or corporate investment in recent decades. Instead, the research and data firmly establish that the main effects of tax changes are to increase or decrease inequality and government revenue.\nJane G. Gravelle and Donald J.

Feldstein\nAbstract\nThis paper discusses how the effects of taxes on economic behavior are important for revenue estimation, for calculating efficiency effects, and for understanding short-term macroeconomoic consequences. The primary focus is on taxes on labor income but some attention is given to taxes on income from saving. Specific calculations illustrate the importance of behavioral responses for accurate calculation of the revenue effects and deadweight losses of tax changes.\nDiscover the world's research\nNo full-text available\n... We estimate the magnitudes of these various effects, i.e., behavioral effects and interactions with other tax bases, and compare aggregate measures from this more ambitious revenue estimating approach to estimates obtained under current static revenue estimating practices. The paper thus presents an estimate of the extent to which tax cuts may be \"self-fi nancing\" due to such behavioral and interaction effects, as discussed by Lindsey (1987), Feldstein (1995 Feldstein ( , 2008, Carroll and Hrung (2005), and Mankiw and Weinzierl (2006).  ...\n...

Accordingly, instead of using a labor supply simulation model, we could have used the taxable income elasticity estimates for Norway of Aarbu and Thoresen (2001).  ...\n...

Historically, these types of proposals, such as the flat tax, have not succeeded.

The effect varies, however, across OECD countries. The redistributive impact of taxes and transfers depends on the size, mix and the progressivity of each component. Some countries with a relatively small tax and welfare system (e.g. Australia) achieve the same redistributive impact as countries characterised by much higher taxes and transfers (e.g. Germany) because they rely more on income taxes, which are more progressive than other taxes, and on means-tested cash transfers. This article provides an assessment of the redistributive effect of the main taxes and cash transfers, based on various OECD data sources, a set of policy indicators and a literature review. Using cluster analysis, it also identifies empirically four groups of countries with tax and transfer systems that share broadly similar features.\nEnglish\nMore On\nYou have access to READ the content online, if option available\nCITE THIS ARTICLE\nEMAIL THIS PAGE\nAuthor(s)\nIsabelle Joumard , Mauro Pisu and Debbie Bloch OECD\n12 Jul 2012\n34 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1787/eco_studies-2012-5k95xd6l65lt\nPages: 37\n- 70"]}
{"query_id": "360", "generated_response": "The fall of the Western Roman Empire (traditionally dated to 476 CE) resulted from a complex combination of internal weaknesses and external pressures that developed over more than a century. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the main factors:\n\n## Internal Political and Social Problems\n\n### Political Instability and Civil Wars\nThe empire suffered from chronic political turmoil that severely weakened its foundations. From 217 CE until the collapse, \"there were only a handful of periods as long as ten years when a civil war did not break out\" [1]. These constant internal conflicts had devastating consequences:\n\n- Emperors frequently abandoned foreign wars to deal with Roman rivals and usurpers [1]\n- Each civil war drained the empire of money and supplies while destroying provinces and farmlands [1]\n- Military loyalty shifted from Rome to individual commanders who fought for the throne [1]\n\n### Military Deterioration  \nThe once-legendary Roman military became increasingly unreliable:\n\n- \"Successive civil wars dislocated the army's administrative and logistical structures, its training patterns, recruitment and also its discipline\" [1]\n- The government began recruiting foreign mercenaries who worked solely for money and showed little loyalty to Rome [1]\n- Soldiers gave their allegiance to commanders rather than Rome itself [1]\n\n### Economic Decline\n- Continuous warfare and civil strife led to agricultural devastation and food shortages [1]\n- High taxation combined with inflation created economic instability [1]\n- The gap between rich and poor widened significantly [1]\n- Land became overworked and infertile due to constant military campaigns [1]\n\n### Administrative Challenges\nThe empire's massive size created logistical problems that proved insurmountable [2]. Emperors divided major provinces to prevent any single person from commanding too large an army, but this created new problems by making \"a far wider selection of people eligible for control of the throne\" [1].\n\n### Loss of Civic Unity\nCitizens lost their sense of patriotism due to \"civil wars, high taxation, and food shortages\" [1]. The government showed \"limited ambitions and lacked concern for major issues such as health, education, and agriculture\" [1].\n\n## External Factors\n\n### Barbarian Migrations and Invasions\nThe westward movement of the Huns under Attila caused massive displacement of barbarian tribes, who then migrated into Roman territory [2]. Key barbarian groups included:\n\n- Visigoths in Spain\n- Vandals in Africa  \n- Various Germanic tribes including Quadi, Saxons, Burgundians, and others [2]\n\nBy 406 CE, St. Jerome described the devastation: \"Nations innumerable and most savage have invaded all Gaul. The whole region between the Alps and the Pyrenees, the ocean and the Rhine, has been devastated\" by various barbarian tribes [2].\n\n### Military Vulnerability to External Threats\nThe weakened Roman armies were \"sparse and weak\" due to economic problems, making them vulnerable to \"continuous barrage of barbarian hordes along the borders\" [2]. Rome was sacked twice within three decades, with the final sack by Odoacer, a Germanic king, leading to the virtual destruction of the Western Empire in 475 CE [2].\n\n## The Interconnected Nature of Decline\n\nImportantly, the external invasions were only successful because of internal weaknesses. As one analysis notes, \"Throughout their history the Romans had always fought a lot of wars against very varied opponents. They had suffered some serious defeats, but had always recovered\" [1]. The difference this time was that internal problems had severely weakened Rome's ability to respond effectively.\n\nThe fall wasn't caused by a single event but rather \"slow occurrences in succession to one another\" [3]. Most historians agree that \"neither internal nor external forces can be ignored\" [3], though the internal factors - particularly political instability, military decline, and economic problems - created the vulnerability that external forces exploited to bring about the empire's ultimate collapse.", "citations": ["https://newyorkessays.com/essay-internal-factors-responsible-for-the-fall-of-rome/", "https://www.cram.com/essay/Internal-And-External-Factors-The-Fall-Of/PKUQWEFNB5ZW\n", "https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Internal-And-Internal-Factors-The-Fall-Of-PZPJHPGBRW6"], "contexts": ["Internal Factors Responsible for the Fall of Rome Essay Example For FREE 📝 - New York Essays\nFree essay samples World Europe Rome Internal Factors Responsible for the Fall of Rome\nInternal Factors Responsible for the Fall of Rome\nInternal Factors Responsible for the Fall of Rome There were several reasons for the fall of rome but internal problems such as military deficiency, political turmoil, and a weakened economy were the predominant forces leading up to the fall. Civil wars were a common occurrence in western Europe and often challenged the imperial throne. “It is worth once again emphasizing that from 217 down to the collapse of Western Empire there were only a handful of periods as long as ten years when a civil war did not break out” (Goldsworthy).\nDon’t waste time\nGet a verified expert to help you with Internal Factors Responsible for the Fall of Rome\nHire verified writer\n$35.80 for a 2-page paper\nEmperors constantly faced threats for the throne and often abandoned war against foreign enemy to deal with a Roman rival or Usurper. Each civil war drained the empire of money and supplies. What was gained by the winning side was lost by through the destruction of provinces and farmlands. “Successive civil wars dislocated the army’s administrative and logistical structures, its training patterns, recruitment and also it’s discipline, which suffered whenever license was given in an effort to win loyalty” (Goldsworthy).\nInternal Factors Responsible for the Fall of Rome Essay Example\nOver time the military was in such disarray soldiers gave their allegiance not to Rome but to their commanders, who fought among themselves for the throne. In efforts to defend themselves from attack the government started to recruit foreign soldiers that would work for money. Because these soldiers were working solely for the money, they showed even less loyalty to Rome. The military was falling apart and causing fear among Emperors that they might lose their power.\nPersonal survival became the priority of every empire and largely shaped their ideas and decisions. One of the changes brought about by the want of survival was the marginalisation of the senatorial class. Major provinces were divided so that no one could command too large of an army and therefor become to powerful. The problem that came about for emperors was that now, a far wider selection of people could be eligible for control of the throne making the threat for the throne even larger. This caused emperors to have little trust in anyone.\nIf an emperor could not trust anyone with sufficient power to deal with a distant problem, most likely the problem was not dealt with at all. “This sense of neglect by central government prompted a region to rebel and proclaim it’s own emperor” (Goldsworthy). A solution to this problem was to have two emperors. This system had very little success and caused even more separation of military and civil order. Overall, the fear of usurpers overtaking power, lead emperors to lose focus on the necessary credentials of a successful society.\nThe government had limited ambitions and lacked concern for major issues such as health, education, and agriculture. Due to the mass amounts of civil war taken place on Roman land, farming and agriculture greatly suffered. Land was over worked and overused causing the land to become infertile. Soon food shortages and diseases caused the population to decrease. From the cumulations of lost money to war and farming the economy weakened and inflation became high. The gap between the rich and poor gradually increased and the economy weakened.\nBetween civil wars, high taxation, and food shortages, citizens lost a sense patriotism that once flourished throughout society. Throughout all this turmoil it is a wonder how the fall did not come any earlier. The turmoil caused the empire to weaken becoming more susceptible to attacks from bordering countries. And that’s exactly what happened. Some of the foremost enemies of the Western Empire were Germanic tribes including Visigoths in Spain and the Vandals in Africa. The Huns also contributed a great deal to the fall of the empire yet did not form lasting empires on the land they conquered.\nWith this being said, the attacks that came from these groups were only successful because of the internal problems weakening Rome’s military and central government. “Throughout their history the Romans had always fought a lot of wars against very varied opponents. They had suffered some serious defeats, but had always recovered” (Goldsworthy). This shows that the external forces were far less insignificant in the fall of rome than the internal conflicts faced by the Roman empire.", "Internal And External Factors: The Fall Of The Western Roman... | Cram\nInternal And External Factors: The Fall Of The Western Roman Empire\nGood Essays\n1452 Words\n6 Pages\nOpen Document\nEssay Sample\nShow More\nCheck Writing Quality\nThe fall of the ‘Western Roman Empire’ was caused by a number of internal and external factors spread over more than a century.

Given the Western Empire’s economic downturn it’s armies were already sparse and weak and the continuos barrage of barbarian hordes along the borders depleted them further until they were virtually defenceless. So once barbarian tribes in the North and East discovered this fact they took their chance to pounce and so swept through and reconquered territory from the Romans. Rome was sacked twice in the space of three decades the final one leading to the virtual destruction of the West Empire by Odacer a Germanic King. In 475 A.D the Western Empire was completely reconquered by barbarian tribes.

{"query_id": "2024-145979", "generated_response": "# Vicarious Trauma: Understanding and Coping Strategies\n\n## What is Vicarious Trauma?\n\nVicarious trauma is **a process of change resulting from empathetic engagement with trauma survivors** [1]. It occurs when professionals or individuals are indirectly exposed to traumatic events through hearing detailed accounts, witnessing trauma materials, or working closely with trauma survivors [3][8]. This psychological response involves **dramatic changes in the way a person experiences themselves, others, and the environment** [4].\n\nThe condition is also known by related terms including secondary traumatic stress, compassion fatigue, and traumatic stewardship, though these have subtle differences in their specific definitions [4][8].\n\n## Who is at Risk?\n\nVicarious trauma particularly affects those in **caring professions**, including [1][3]:\n- Healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, surgeons)\n- Mental health professionals (counselors, therapists, social workers)\n- Emergency responders (police officers, firefighters, paramedics)\n- Legal professionals (lawyers, judges)\n- Journalists and humanitarian workers\n- Anyone with close relationships to trauma survivors\n\n**Risk factors** that increase vulnerability include [8]:\n- Prior traumatic experiences\n- Social isolation\n- Lack of preparation and training\n- Being newer to the profession\n- Constant exposure to traumatic material\n- Lack of supportive processes for discussing traumatic work content\n\n## Signs and Symptoms\n\nVicarious trauma manifests across multiple domains [1][3][8]:\n\n### Emotional Symptoms\n- Lingering feelings of anger, rage, and sadness\n- Emotional numbing or feeling shut down\n- Loss of hope, pessimism, cynicism\n- Anxiety, irritability, and feeling overwhelmed\n\n### Cognitive/Behavioral Changes\n- Preoccupation with patients/clients outside work\n- Difficulty maintaining professional boundaries\n- Over-identification with clients\n- Avoidance of traumatic content\n- Changes in worldview and beliefs about safety\n\n### Physical Symptoms\n- Fatigue and sleep difficulties\n- Headaches and physical complaints\n- Decreased resistance to illness\n\n## Effective Coping Strategies\n\n### Individual Self-Care Approaches\n\n**Personal Well-being** [1][5]:\n- Maintain healthy work-life balance\n- Engage in regular physical exercise\n- Ensure adequate sleep and nutrition\n- Practice mindfulness and relaxation techniques\n- Pursue hobbies and interests outside work\n\n**Professional Strategies** [1][4]:\n- Seek regular supervision and consultation\n- Use peer support systems and \"buddy\" arrangements\n- Take regular breaks and time off when needed\n- Balance caseload with varying levels of trauma exposure\n- Engage in ongoing professional training\n\n**Emotional Processing** [4]:\n- Allow yourself to feel emotions rather than avoiding them\n- Seek personal therapy when needed\n- Use consultation to process difficult cases\n- Practice self-awareness and emotional regulation\n\n### Organizational Support\n\nResearch shows that **organizational factors significantly influence** the development and management of vicarious trauma [4][5][7]:\n\n**Workplace Interventions** [5][9]:\n- Provide trauma-informed organizational culture\n- Offer flexible work arrangements\n- Ensure adequate staffing to distribute trauma exposure\n- Create supportive supervision structures\n- Implement employee assistance programs\n\n**Training and Education** [5][9]:\n- Provide orientation about vicarious trauma\n- Offer ongoing professional development\n- Pair new employees with experienced mentors\n- Create workplace cultures that prioritize self-care\n\n## Treatment Options\n\nWhen self-care strategies aren't sufficient, professional treatment may be needed [3]:\n\n- **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)**: Addresses distorted thinking patterns and trauma-related symptoms\n- **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)**: Helps reduce negative feelings and thoughts associated with traumatic material\n- **Individual or group therapy**: Provides safe space to process work-related trauma exposure\n\n## Important Research Findings\n\nNotably, research indicates that **simply knowing about coping strategies doesn't automatically protect against vicarious trauma** [7]. A significant study found that while professionals believed in recommended coping strategies, there was **no association between time devoted to these activities and actual trauma symptom reduction** [7]. This suggests that **organizational changes** (such as limiting trauma exposure through workload management) may be more effective than individual coping strategies alone.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Vicarious trauma is a **normal occupational hazard** in helping professions, not a sign of personal weakness\n- **Early recognition and intervention** are crucial for preventing long-term negative effects\n- **Both individual self-care and organizational support** are necessary for effective management\n- **Professional help should be sought** when symptoms persist or interfere with functioning\n- Organizations have a responsibility to create **trauma-informed work environments** that protect their employees\n\nThe most effective approach combines personal self-care practices with supportive organizational policies that limit exposure and provide adequate resources for processing traumatic work content [4][5][8].", "citations": ["https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/your-wellbeing/vicarious-trauma/vicarious-trauma-signs-and-strategies-for-coping\n", "https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/coping-trauma-work-and-vicarious-trauma-guide-professionals-and", "https://cbtpsychology.com/vicarioustrauma/\n", "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-45285-8_10", "https://mhcd.org/healthcare-workers-vicarious-trauma/", "https://balanceluxuryrehab.com/mental-health/vicarious-trauma/\n", "https://www.academia.edu/18244809/Strategies_for_Reducing_Secondary_or_Vicarious_Trauma_Do_They_Work", "https://ovc.ojp.gov/program/vtt/what-is-vicarious-trauma\n", "https://www.griefworkcenter.com/what-is-vicarious-trauma/\n", "http://adelaidetraumacentre.com.au/professional-support/vicarious-traumatisation-management/"], "contexts": ["Vicarious trauma: signs and strategies for coping\nAdvice and support\nYour wellbeing\nVicarious trauma: signs and strategies for coping\nHow to cope with the aftermath of traumatic incidents and spot the signs of trauma in those who have been involved in caring for others.\nLocation: UK\nAudience: All doctors\nLast reviewed: 17 January 2022\nVicarious trauma is a process of change resulting from empathetic engagement with trauma survivors.\nAnyone who engages empathetically with survivors of traumatic incidents, torture, and material relating to their trauma, is potentially affected, including doctors and other health professionals.\nCommon signs of vicarious trauma\nIf you are currently or have recently been working with survivors of traumatic incidents or torture survivors, you should be aware of the following signs:\nexperiencing lingering feelings of anger, rage and sadness about patient's victimisation\nbecoming overly involved emotionally with the patient\nexperiencing bystander guilt, shame, feelings of self-doubt\nbeing preoccupied with thoughts of patients outside of the work situation\nover identification with the patient (having horror and rescue fantasies)\nloss of hope, pessimism, cynicism\ndistancing, numbing, detachment, cutting patients off, staying busy.

It is a process through which the professional's inner experience is negatively transformed through empathic engagement with a client's trauma material (McCann and Pearlman (1990). The experience of vicarious trauma is stressful and can lead to burnout whose symptoms are emotional exhaustion, diminished productivity, and depersonalization or cynicism. This booklet describes some of the potential indicators of vicarious trauma based in physical, behavioral, social, emotional, spiritual, and attitudinal symptoms. The booklet notes different effects of vicarious trauma relative to the type of trauma experienced by a client. Healthy and adaptive coping strategies for vicarious trauma are described. They include seeking support from colleagues, mental relaxation through meditation, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, healthy sleep, practicing awareness of inner thoughts and feelings, balancing life and work, and focusing on the value and achievements of one's therapeutic work. Suggestions for planning and implementing self-care are also offered, along with strategies and suggestions for organizational support, supervision, and peer connections for the workplace. 44 resource listings\nAdditional Details\nSale Source\nTS Nelson\nP.O.

The more empathetic and open you are in your profession, the more likely it is that you will share the pain and devastation of those impacted by trauma. Often, people who help behind the scenes in helping those with trauma might neglect their own exposure.\nIn this article, you will learn what Vicarious Trauma is, some of the symptoms associated with it. You will also learn how to cope with Vicarious Trauma so that you can live a happy and balanced professional life.\nWhat is Vicarious Trauma & Who is Susceptible to it?\nVicarious Trauma refers to the trauma you may experience when being indirectly exposed to a traumatic event. It could be a situation where the life of another person was being threatened or witnessing the death of someone else. It is as if you’ve taken this trauma as your own, and it has triggered a shocking reaction in your emotions and actions. Vicarious Trauma typically involves a changein personal beliefs about the self and the world.\nThose in caring professions are most susceptible to experiencing Vicarious Trauma, including but not limited to the following jobs:\nDoctors, surgeons, nurses, personal support workers\nCounsellors, therapists, social workers\nPolice officers, soldiers, rescue workers\nLawyers, journalists, clergy, humanitarian workers\nIn addition, if you have a close relationship with someone who has survived personal trauma, you may also experience Vicarious Trauma.\nThose with Vicarious Trauma are at risk of developing mental health issues because they might neglect their own issues. These issues might including anxiety, clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addiction, among other problems. This is why it is important to address this trauma as soon as you can.\nSigns and Symptoms of Vicarious Trauma\nVicarious trauma is directly related to a lack of work-life balance and the single experience of a traumatic event such as witnessing someone being tortured or threatened. This trauma affects how you think, feel, and act:\nEmotional: feeling anxious, sad, irritable, angry, numb, on edge\nThoughts: jaded view of the world, cynicism,  and negativity. You might find it hard to stop worrying about the individual who has experienced trauma even after work is over. You may also no longer feeling a sense of purpose in your job\nPhysiological: headaches, stomach pain, exhaustion (among other physical symptoms)\nBehavioural: isolating or disconnecting from others, alcohol or substance abuse, experiencing a change in eating habits, engaging in risky behaviour, having difficulty sleeping and procrastinating.You may also find yourself struggling with concentration, decision making, and memory\nIn this, Ted Talk where trauma worker Amy Cunningham talks about ways vicarious trauma can manifest negatively in our lives. She also reminds us to put ourselves first.\nDrowning in Empathy: The Cost of Vicarious Trauma | Amy Cunningham | TEDxSanAntonio\nWatch on\nHow to Treat Vicarious Trauma\nThe first stride towards treating Vicarious Trauma is taking a step back and getting yourself out of the trauma victim’s shoes. You must recognize that you are not alone in your pain. Often, treating Vicarious Trauma means learning how to take care of yourself again, through the body and the mind:\nTake care of your body. Make sure you’re getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and exercising regularly\nBeing aware and mindful. Medicate time to engage in hobbies that make you feel good, practice mindfulness or yoga, and consider therapy.\nAllow yourself to be social.Get out and socialize with family, friends, and loved ones. Socializing is great fuel for the mind.\nRemember, treating your Vicarious Trauma may require taking some well-deserved time off work. So, don’t be hesitant to do so!\nMethods To Treat Vicarious Trauma\nTrauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT):\nTF-CBT caters to the unique needs of the individual through a therapy plan. This therapy plan will address distorted thinking patterns and negative reactions and actions. Additionally, they will help identify other symptoms associated with Vicarious Trauma.\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR):\nEMDR is becoming a rising and sought-after treatment for trauma. It is an effective way to reduce negative feelings, thoughts, and physical sensations associated with your specific trauma. EMDR works by using a series of guided eye movements and other exercises to get you “desensitized” from the traumatic event.\nGet Professional Help\nYou do not have to let Vicarious Trauma take over your life. Trauma therapy is one of the best ways to cope with the trauma of any kind and prevent future occurrences. So, y ou may want to consult with a therapist trained in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Trauma Therapy.\nAdditionally, psychotherapist knowledgeable about vicarious trauma may help you recognize your vicarious pain and any effects of trauma. This can help you heal and move forward. A therapist can also help you replace the lingering negative maternal voice in your head with a healthier one.\n3,471\nAbout Giselle Franco\nGiselle is a Psychology Student at Ryerson University.", "Vicarious Trauma and Self-Care for the Trauma Therapist | SpringerLink\nTreating Complex Trauma pp 191–211 Cite as\nVicarious Trauma and Self-Care for the Trauma Therapist\nTamara McClintock Greenberg\nChapter\nFirst Online: 04 August 2020\n1278 Accesses\n2 Citations\nAbstract\nThe world we live in involves the fact that terrible things happen to people, often perpetuated by other humans. We hear about tragedies in detail and are required to be present with a number of different intense emotions in others as well as ourselves. Trauma is contagious, and as witnesses to suffering, working with traumatized people can take a toll on our minds, bodies, and spirits. I will describe vicarious trauma, compassion fatigue, and secondary traumatic stress and the impact of trauma work on our personal and professional lives. As therapists, we bring unique strengths and vulnerabilities to our clinical work. Self-care is vital to manage the impact of our exposure to trauma and to prevent burnout.\nKeywords\nTrauma\nPTSD\nVicarious trauma\nBurnout\nCompassion fatigue\nTherapist self-care\nTraumatic stewardship\nTherapist vulnerabilities\nSecondary traumatic stress\nEmpathy\nDownload chapter PDF\nCompassion Fatigue and the Impact of Vicarious Trauma\nThe concept of vicarious trauma\n\n\n has often been applied to healthcare and disaster relief workers as well as mental health professionals who work with severely traumatized people. Other labels capturing facets of vicarious trauma have included secondary traumatic stress and compassion fatigue. Lipsky and Burk (2009) encapsulate the burdens and impact of working with traumatized populations under the rubric “traumatic stewardship.” For the purpose of this chapter, I will refer to vicarious trauma, secondary traumatic stress, and compassion fatigue somewhat interchangeably and ask for the reader’s forgiveness if I leave out subtle differences and distinctions regarding these terms. Although I will describe the aforementioned concepts below, I want to focus this chapter on the emotional strains involved in this work, how there are similarities and differences in terms of how we are impacted, the importance and limitations of our empathy, and ways we can consider how to use our feelings to enhance our work (via countertransference) while taking care of ourselves.\nVicarious trauma has been described as a cumulative transformation in the therapist as a result of empathic engagement with client’s traumatic material (Pearlman and Saakvitne 1995 ). It involves dramatic changes in the way the therapist experiences themselves, others, and the environment (Makadia et al. 2017; McCann and Pearlman 1990 ). A profound and poignant example of this was when Lipsky, a trauma therapist (Lipsky and Burk 2009 ), described hiking with her family to the top of a cliff in the Caribbean. While looking over the beautiful scene, Lipsky describes how she began to wonder how many people had jumped from the cliffs. Her thoughts then went to where a helicopter could land in the event someone needed rescuing, if there was a Level 1 trauma center nearby, etc. She realized she had been profoundly changed by the trauma work she had done with clients and how it interfered with her ability to feel enjoyment and pleasure in that otherwise beautiful and serene moment. My first experience with secondary traumatic stress was when I was in my early 30s. At that time I was seeing large numbers of hospitalized patients who had hematologic/oncology illnesses, such as leukemia and lymphoma. Many of my patients were young, and I often had extended relationships with them during prolonged hospitalizations for bone marrow transplants. About 40% of people I saw died from their illnesses. Prior to that I had worked with very severely traumatized populations; for many years I worked with families involved with Child Protective Services. Yet, something about the intense exposure to the hospitalized medical patients changed me and my perceptions of health. One example of this was when I was working in the hospital, I could not believe (on some level) that anyone was healthy or not at risk of getting a severe life-threatening cancer! I somehow could compartmentalize my experiences with abused children, though that hardly seems rational, as dealing with people impacted by even severe child maltreatment is much more statistically common than dealing with clients who have severe cancers. In the early years of seeing hospitalized patients, I also was hypochondriacal. A tennis injury drove me to the emergency room; though that was not necessary, but I feared something ominous. As I look back on this now, I think it had something to do with control. When I worked with abused children, I perceived I could have an influence in their lives and outcome. With many of the people I saw in the hospital whose bodies had so severely betrayed them (and this was during a time with fewer treatments available), I felt helpless in a way that was new to me. Additionally, at that age, I had not experienced the death of anyone very close to me. We all have different vulnerabilities, something I will describe later in the chapter.\nSecondary traumatic stress involves therapist and other professional caregiver’s behaviors and emotions resulting from knowledge about a traumatizing event experienced by significant others, including clients, and resultant symptoms of avoidance, numbing, and hyperarousal, in other words symptoms of PTSD (Figley 1983, 1995 ). I have also previously linked secondary traumatic stress to witnesses of serious and traumatic life-threatening illness (Greenberg 2012 ). Figley links secondary traumatic stress to compassion fatigue, which is the emotional residue or strain of exposure of working with those suffering from the consequences of traumatic events. He states that compassion fatigue can occur due to exposure on one case or can be due to a cumulative level of trauma (Figley 1995 ). Figley notes:\nCompassion Fatigue is a state experienced by those helping people or animals in distress; it is an extreme state of tension and preoccupation with the suffering of those being helped to the degree that it can create a secondary traumatic stress for the helper. We feel the feelings of our clients. We experience their fears. We dream their dreams. Eventually, we lose a certain spark of optimism, humor and hope. We tire. We aren’t sick, but we aren’t ourselves. (personal communication, 2020)\nTrauma has been described as an emotional contagion. When we witness suffering, our experiences can parallel current or anticipated emotions in the person we are with (Miller et al. 1988 ). I find the idea of how we anticipate emotions especially useful. Psychodynamic clinicians have long known that there is a way that attuned therapists can feel things clients may not have access to. For example, Stern et al. (1998) describe implicit relational knowing, in which behaviors and ideas that have not been symbolically represented allow us to pick up on information about emotions and attitudes that we respond to out of conscious awareness. Consider the example of Jed:\nJed was asleep when a firefighter burst into his apartment and told him he had to leave. Flames were engulfing his multistory building. He came in with a clear narrative about what happened, told me about his trip to the emergency room (for smoke inhalation) and what his plan was to meet with his insurance agent, find a new apartment, etc. There was little emotion involved in his telling of his harrowing experience. I, on the other hand, could not think. In the first couple of sessions after the fire, we were having seemingly rational conversations, but in the split screen scenario I have described in other parts of this book, I was silently panicked. I was worried about him but not in any way I could describe. Physically, he was fine. Emotionally, he seemed well-organized and composed, perhaps too much so. In subsequent sessions, I braced myself for what I thought would be or should be intense emotion. That interfered with my ability to listen to him. And even more disturbing to me, I wondered what I would do in the same situation. I feel especially embarrassed about this part of my reaction. I wondered if I should call my insurance agent and check on how much coverage I have. Granted, I’ve known friends and acquaintances in this situation. In California thousands of people have lost their homes due to increases in wildfires all over the state and faulty wiring in very old buildings in the city in which I live. If I consider it rationally, thinking about fire insurance coverage is a good idea, but it was my preoccupation with my own safety, my sense of disorganization and panic which bothered me. Clearly this man was dissociative (something that was already an issue in his treatment), and as is often true with dissociative people, I filled my mind with what I thought emotions should be in Jed. This is what is sometimes perceived as an unconscious communication by a client. My panic and disorganization possibly mirrored his state of mind, but only I was aware of it. Yet, even though it has been several years, I wonder if my initial excessive attunement, if that is what it was, disrupted his ability to find me containing and helpful in the beginning of his crisis.\nFigley (2002) suggests that empathy plays a key role in the development of compassion fatigue. Through empathic responding, therapists experience the emotional distress of a client, and this contributes directly to the development of compassion fatigue. Cerney (1995) goes a step further and suggests that therapists can take over the “pathology” of their clients. I am hesitant to embrace the term pathology when thinking about normal and understandable responses to trauma, but the idea is that we can absorb the suffering of the people we see. Waugaman (2009) speculates that overidentification with clients can lead to vicarious trauma. Overidentification is thought to involve an excessive involvement in the lives of others. When we do this with clients, it’s difficult to think because we are excessively involved and thinking too much about our own experience. This is one way of thinking about how I felt with Jed. The line between overidentification and empathy can be murky, however.\nMost of us are wired with the capacity for empathic responses. Neuroscientists have described the multiple brain activities involved in literally feeling the physical and emotional pain of others. For example, observing another person’s action, pain, or affect can trigger parts of the same neural networks responsible for executing those same actions and experiencing those same feelings firsthand (Armstrong 2017 ). Extreme empathy that results in compassion fatigue can have both costs and benefits. Some note that compassion fatigue is characterized by physical and emotional exhaustion and a pronounced reduction in the ability to feel empathy and compassion for others (Elwood et al. 2011 ). Alternatively, a beautiful paper by Boulanger (2018) describes that vicarious trauma and the kind of empathy therapists are engaged in can be a therapeutic tool that allows us to connect with aspects of client’s lives that we may find too difficult to think about. She described the ways she was able to overcome feelings of horror and the inability to think (which parallel those of her client) when treating a veteran who had been involved in violence against civilians while in Vietnam. Boulanger suggests this kind of immersion in another’s experience may be useful or even necessary in order to be optimally helpful in working with people who have been subject to extreme trauma.\nToo Much Empathy? The Risk of Burnout and Potential Consequences\nAs therapists we often come into the field with a predisposition for feeling empathy and an ability to understand and identify with others. As we age in this profession, many of us get better at mentalizing being able to pick up on nuances of feelings in others. I sometimes joke with my own consultant, who has been practicing for almost 40 years that he and some people in his cohort almost seem like mind-readers! For example, I’ll describe a case in a few sentences, and he seems to hit exactly on what is going on and what my struggles might be. Granted, I’ve known him a long time, and we have a good collaborative relationship; he knows my strengths and vulnerabilities. I have wondered, though, if after seeing hundreds of clients if we develop unconscious algorithms based on subtle verbal and nonverbal cues. Or perhaps some of us simply get better at thinking because we are less rattled. On the value of growing older, psychoanalyst Joyce Slochower (2019) stated about her work as an older therapist, “I’ve never felt better about my work. I trust my analytic intuition; I can work deeply with far more ease than in earlier years. I have a sense of clinical wisdom that I certainly lacked as a young analyst. When I don’t know what’s going on, I can stay in the process without the kind of anxiety that plagues my younger supervisees” (p. 552).\nNote that psychoanalysts are required to undergo several years of their own treatment; many therapists in the field have more than one extended therapy or analysis. It is often the case that many therapists who work on themselves professionally and personally get better with age. It takes less time to figure out what might be going on with a client, we feel more confident, and hopefully we have a clearer sense of the limitations of our abilities. However, particularly if we work with very traumatized people, there is a threshold to what we can endure. In thinking about colleagues who are emotionally healthy and who continue to enjoy the work well into their 70s and 80s, one commonality I’ve noticed is their ability to set limits. They say no to referrals that don’t seem like a good fit, and they realize the limits of their emotional capacity. I recently asked one senior colleague to take on a lovely but very traumatized person in his practice, and after he politely declined he said, “I have to limit the number of clients I take, even if I am intrigued and I can maybe help them. If I don’t do this, I’ll feel compelled to retire.” This seems like a good model.\nIf we are not careful, compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress, and vicarious trauma can take their toll. I think of burnout as the endpoint of these latter states. To put it succulently, I consider burnout as a state of mind in a therapist or clinician that makes me hesitant in referring to them, as I worry they may be too cynical or exhausted to treat someone with complex trauma. In some cases, burned out clinicians can pose a danger to the people they treat. I can’t say this with certainty in all or even the majority of cases of burned out clinicians. As I’ll discuss, there is limited research on this topic. We all have our struggles as trauma therapists, and many of us have complicated and difficult histories. Our backgrounds can certainly be assets when seeing people with cPTSD. But let me provide an example which will illustrate burnout and my hesitancy in providing referrals to those I imagine might be suffering too much to help others.\nDr. Johnson was a late middle-aged psychiatrist who had a reputation for treating people with trauma histories. I met Dr. Johnson when I was in training and had known him for over two decades. I always had a positive view of him, and I found him to be both psychologically astute and patient with clients, as well as very good regarding medications. I referred people to him for almost as long as I had been in practice, until several years ago. I began to notice he seemed not to take seriously some of the issues clients presented to him. For example, in one situation when a client needed a lot of attention in getting off an antidepressant (one that is notorious for complicated side effects in trying to decrease the dosage), he told the client “he did not want to deal with it.” He suggested this client stay on the medication, though it was causing her unpleasant side effects and she really wanted to taper her dosage. Following that, with another client of mine, whom he and I had seen for several years and whom I’ll refer to as Mary, Dr. Johnson began to talk with Mary about his personal struggles. He disclosed things to Mary that I can’t repeat here, as they would provide too much identifying detail, but these were personal and family-related facts I could never imagine discussing with a client under any circumstance. Eventually, Mary’s psychiatric sessions became therapy sessions for Dr. Johnson. For the most part, Mary was not actually (or consciously) disturbed about this; she loved having access to a “doctor’s mind” and problems. Mary and I eventually understood it as “evening the playing field for her.” Indeed, Mary had often complained that she did not know enough about me. She wanted personal details of my life, and I would not provide them in enough detail to satisfy her. I’m not opposed to self-disclosure, but Mary wanted information about me that I did not feel comfortable sharing. For example, after my mother died (and I had been away from work for a couple of weeks), she was enraged that I did not tell her the details of how she died. She looked this information up online and wanted me to talk about it with her. Mary seemed to have no access to empathy about what it might be like for me to discuss the details of my mother’s death, who had died relatively young, not to mention suddenly. As Mary had been in mental healthcare her entire life, it seemed a triumph for her that Dr. Johnson was so open, as other clinicians had been more austere and judicious regarding self-disclosure. At the same time, Mary often presented to me after sessions with Dr. Johnson seeming guilty and conflicted. She knew on some level something was wrong, and it was both exciting and overstimulating for her. In the sessions with Dr. Johnson, they were not dealing with issues she needed to be addressed which she did voice was frustrating, but Mary was more focused on the victory she felt in regard to her “getting” Dr. Johnson to talk about himself. Related to what she imagined my response might be (which in reality was a mixture of shock, horror, disgust, curiosity, and disbelief), she recited every confession and aspect of the TMI—too much information—that was inflicted and spilled out by Dr. Johnson. It appeared to be reenactment for Mary, but not one that would warrant the outrage or even concern I expected. Chronic abuse and exploitation was in Mary’s background. She felt special in the relationship with Dr. Johnson in which she had become (in her mind) an important person with whom he could spill his secrets. She imagined she was the only one he talked to this way. When Dr. Johnson lost his license for reasons related to competency and a number of patient complaints which included the use of substances during sessions, Mary kept in contact with him, well after he retired. They became friends on social media. They traded emails about how they were doing. Any comments I made regarding how this relationship did not seem to be designed to suit Mary were met with ideas that I did not understand how special Dr. Johnson was. In terms of my ability to help Mary think about the actual intrusion and exploitive aspects of this psychiatric relationship, their ongoing contact rendered me helpless and useless for a long time regarding this specific issue.\nDr. Johnson and Mary’s relationship illustrates the complicated trail of damage that can result from a clinician who may be suffering from burnout. In the multiple versions of Dr. Johnson I have known, with the exception of one clinician, they all started out as sought-out experts in their fields. They were highly regarded and they really seemed to help people. In fact, I have seen a number of people after a previous clinician either lost their license and/or died by suicide following boundary violations. I heard in most cases how helpful and empathic the clinician was. This is hard to explain; it may be that something tragic happened to these doctors later in their careers. It may be that certain maladaptive coping behaviors (i.e., substance abuse) worsened. We don’t really know in detail what happens for many clinicians who cross the line.\nFreudenberger (1974) used the term “burnout” to conceptualize a type of stress associated with feelings of exhaustion, disconnection, and self-doubt derived from emotionally involved work in helping professions. Burnout is associated with physical and emotional fatigue, depersonalization, negative feelings or attitudes toward clients and job tasks, cynicism, and decreased professional efficacy (Maslach 1986; Maslach and Jackson 1981; Schutte et al. 2000 ). Although it may seem to be the case, it’s not clear that burnout is linked with clinician boundary violations. Much of the data is anecdotal. In fact, I looked at several articles which stated that both burnout and vicarious trauma are linked with boundary violations (e.g., Everall and Paulson 2004; Neumann and Gamble 1995 ), but there were no studies listed. Even experts who have written extensively on boundary violations find it hard to categorize exactly what leads to serious missteps, but burnout is not at the top of the list. Gabbard (2006) notes that therapist factors such as divorce, death of a parent or spouse, or death of a client by suicide have been associated with therapists who have committed serious boundary violations. Sexual misconduct with a client was associated with factors related to therapist dissatisfaction with their personal life such as loneliness, divorce or a relationship crisis, a parent’s death, personal illness, and financial concerns (Lamb et al. 2003; Norris et al. 2003 ). Guy et al. (1993) reported that therapists who were substantially impacted by divorce were more likely to maintain social contact with clients after termination of the therapy.\nTo be clear, burnout should not be equated with impairment (Norcross and VandenBos 2018 ). There is not enough data to make this leap, as intuitive as it may seem. I think it’s reasonable to assume that we can’t be as good at our jobs if we are overwhelmed and preoccupied with our work or personal lives, however. Kahill (1988) described five core areas that impact the burnout professional, involving (1) physical symptoms, including a variety of physical complaints such as headaches, exhaustion, and gastrointestinal distress; (2) emotional symptoms involving irritability, depression, anxiety, and sense of helplessness; (3) behavioral symptoms such as aggression, callousness, cynicism, defensiveness, and substance abuse; (4) work-related symptoms such as frequent absenteeism; and (5) interpersonal problems including withdrawing from clients and overintellectualizing or dehumanizing clients. In addition, authors note that client acuity and intensity of problems that seem beyond the scope of practice for the clinician are related to burnout (Maslach and Jackson 1981 ). Regarding the latter, in a medical school I worked for, we used to temper expectations among medical students when working with highly traumatized clients, who were often marginally housed, with many adverse events in their recent and past histories by reminding the students that they could not provide their patients with a “life transplant.” These young professionals wanted to do just that, but there was only so much that could be offered. It’s difficult for anyone—though I think especially when clinicians are young—to confront injustice and tragedy. For the empathically attuned person, it can seem that just a few wrong turns and a lack of privilege can lead to disastrous life circumstance that many of us may imagine being in. Seeing trauma is terrifying as well as contagious.\nInterestingly, a higher sense of trust in work settings is associated with a reduction in compassion fatigue and related symptoms (Johnson et al. 2016 ). One study found that bilingual Latina or Latino clinicians endorsed lower degrees of burnout relative to their monolingual, English colleagues (Teran et al. 2017 ). These authors described that the “lower levels of burnout among this [therapist] sample could be explained by significant pride, satisfaction, and connection to their ethnic and cultural identities” (p. 27). This study is illuminating in a number of ways but I think illustrates that we need to feel connected to professional communities as well as our clients, even in hard times, and to have a sense of overall meaning and purpose.\nA measured sense of optimism and hopefulness is required in order to take care of some of the people that need our help. It seems that in order to do this work effectively in the long term, we need to hold onto aspects of hope in the resiliency of the human spirit. How to do this without being naïve, overly empathic, or overly identifying is complicated, however. Empathy is predictive of the development of vicarious trauma and compassion fatigue as are past traumas in clinicians, exposure to trauma, and distress of clients, including treating a high number of traumatized individuals (Turgoose and Maddox 2017 ). Some studies have not found that therapist trauma history is correlated with secondary traumatic stress, but this may have to do with the nature of the clients treated. It is possible that therapists experience more symptoms of vicarious trauma among people who have similar backgrounds. For example, in one study among mental health disaster workers following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, past trauma history was not related with secondary traumatic stress (Creamer and Liddle 2005 ). However, heavier prior trauma caseload, less professional experience, youth, and therapist’s discussion of trauma work (meaning about client’s) in his or her own therapy were connected with symptoms of secondary traumatic stress, measured by reported distress, and symptoms of intrusion and avoidance. In one review of the literature, over half of therapists reported moderate symptoms of burnout (Simionato and Simpson 2018 ). Psychotherapist factors connected with burnout included neuroticism (defined as anxiety, depressive tendencies, negativity, hypochondriacal concerns, or, as Lahey [2009] describes it, relatively stable tendencies to respond with negative emotions to threat, frustration, or loss), rigid thinking style, excessive conscientiousness, perfectionism, overinvolvement in client problems, as well as younger age and having less work experience. Interestingly, “disagreeable” traits, such as egocentrism, less compassion, competitiveness, and high introverted traits (e.g., shyness), were also associated with increased job stress due to less interpersonal connection with clients (Simionato and Simpson 2018 ).\nThe interpersonal connection we have with clients can be a protective factor against burnout. Although I have a reputation for and a genuine comfort level with being someone who can work with those who are more challenging (which I suppose is code for angry) clients, I have found that I need to be thoughtful about whom I see. As I have gotten older, I have learned that I need to balance my practice with those who may present as challenging right at the start of therapy and with those clients who initially expect and desire more warmth and collaboration.\nIt’s always somewhat fraught when I say (partly in jest) to younger colleagues that it took me 10 years to have a basic sense of what I was doing as a psychologist and another 20 to feel competent. At almost 30 years of treating clients, I am still learning. This is a field in which there can be a great benefit to growing older, as long as we remember we need others to help us in the challenging work that we do. I have noticed at times when I am supervising people new to the field, I sometimes can’t tell if they are describing something that is really happening with the client or if this is some dynamic or issue present in themselves, or both. I think when we are new to the field, there is a risk of overidentifying with the clients that we treat. Yet, as we saw with Dr. Johnson, clinicians who are highly experienced can be subject to difficulties. Our younger colleagues may have an advantage of not succumbing to some of the pitfalls associated with being an “expert” and the potential grandiosity that can be associated with that. However, no matter our age and experience level, we can all be vulnerable to the impact of our work. This may have something to do with our own personal histories.\nTherapist Vulnerabilities\nUnderstanding what is on the minds\n\n\n of our clients is the key to doing this work well, and there is evidence that as therapists we are especially likely to be able to relate to our clients and their suffering. For example, one study found that almost 70% of female psychologists and 33% of male psychologists surveyed acknowledged a history of physical or sexual abuse as children and more than one-third acknowledged experiencing some form of abuse as adults (Pope and Feldman-Summers 1992 ). Compared with women from other professions, female mental health professionals acknowledged far greater histories of childhood abuse, parental alcoholism, and dysfunction in their family of origin and were more likely to have experienced the death of a family member or the psychiatric hospitalization of a parent (Elliott and Guy 1993 ). Such experiences result in therapists having served in a caregiving or parenting role as children (Racusin et al. 1981 ). However, having experienced the same issues as clients can be thought of as an advantage. In substance abuse treatment settings, 60–70% of treatment providers are former substance users themselves (Fialk 2019 ). It can be helpful for people with eating disorders to see a therapist that has struggled in a similar way but is “in recovery” (Verbeek 2018 ). If we think back to Chapter 1 and what makes us good clinicians, the therapeutic relationship and empathy are vital, and I do think there can be some advantage when we have experienced some of the same things as our clients. However, it seems important that we have a conscious idea of similarities, that we don’t overidentify with them and risk a merging of identities and hopefully have a bit more practice working through our own difficulties. In other words, if we want to help our patients, it’s important to be a patient ourselves, many times throughout our careers.\nThere is a less flattering side to some of us who enter the field. Although there can be aspects of altruism and a desire to help people, therapists have often been referred to with the mocking label as “wounded healers.” Norcross and VandenBos (2018) note that sometimes therapists have been drawn into the field so that they can exercise influence or live vicariously through their clients, or more disquietingly to seek power and control. These authors state further that some therapists tend to be people with histories of being loners and of being lonely. Pope and Tabachnick (1994) found that psychologist survey respondents acknowledged depression, relationship difficulties, anxiety, and self-esteem/self-confidence problems. Of these clinicians, 60% acknowledged being significantly depressed at some time during their careers, 29% reported having felt suicidal, and nearly 4% had attempted suicide. In another study, more than 50% of psychologists reported that fears about clients negatively impacted their personal functioning, including sleep, diet, concentration, and focus (Pope and Tabachnick 1993 ). These worries were focused on the lack of available clinical resources to meet a client’s needs, the possibility that a client would file a complaint, and on possible criticism by colleagues. Psychologists reporting work or personal distress acknowledged that their distress adversely impacted the quality of service provided to clients, with 5% reporting that the care they provided was inadequate, and in another sample almost 60% of the practicing psychologists surveyed acknowledged working when too distressed to be effective (Guy et al. 1989; Pope et al. 1987 ).\nI realize that some of this research may be daunting. We all have complicated reasons we chose this career. I think it’s important that we consider our assets and limitations and how these contributed to our choice in becoming psychotherapists. I wonder how much this happens, however. Thinking about my own therapies in which I have been a patient, I have noticed a pregnant silence when bringing up this topic. I have felt that my therapists and some colleagues don’t want to describe or think about the fact that we might have mixed motives for our career choice. More worrisome to me has been an attitude of colleagues who idealize being a therapist, as if we have some special knowledge or power. This just does not seem helpful. Surely we learn certain skills and if we get good at them, we can help people. But this does not mean we can help everyone, and it definitely does not mean we necessarily have special advantages in our private lives. Although we are in a field in which people can and do idealize us, it’s important to hold in mind the reality that we are far from perfect.\nIt’s helpful to focus on the ways our own experiences can be useful to clients, as long as we can provide good boundaries and avoid becoming merged with them. Whenever I have a client in which I fear the latter could happen, I seek out consultation with a trusted colleague and with whom I can be open about my own vulnerabilities as a therapist. And of course our own personal therapies help. In order to be effective, we need to have dealt with our own personal issues, including the number of different reasons we chose this profession.\nIt also goes without saying that for those of us in private practice and even some community settings, there is a financial investment in keeping people in therapy. Whether it’s what we get paid per hour or even RVU systems which is an example of rewarding clinician productivity, we may be incentivized to keep people in treatment when we are not a good fit for them. Once I became more comfortable with this inherent and complicated risk of being in private practice, I became much more assertive in my own thinking and even talking with clients about the importance of us both feeling that I am the right person to treat them. There is also an ethical obligation to protect clients if we do not feel we are the right fit. This is something I discuss in the first month or so of seeing someone in which the therapy has not gained a comfort level or traction that I would expect. I’m not talking here about someone who is guarded because of cPTSD, as that is something I can usually speak to early on. Clients in this situation can often acknowledge they are hesitant, but have a sense of being connected to me, nevertheless. They might be guarded with me about some topics but not all aspects of conversation. For people who are not the right fit, I am thinking about clients where it is clear that my personality does not seem to be a good match. For example, I use humor a lot with the people I see and sometimes clients find this annoying. Of course I can back this off if I sense I am bothering someone or they tell me about it. Whatever the reason, not everyone likes me and that is perfectly fine. Clients deserve therapy with someone they can like and connect with. It’s a protective factor when things get difficult in treatment. Empathy is more than an intellectual exercise; it means getting to really know someone’s internal experience if they allow that. If it seems I might have difficulty with being a match for someone, there are many talented people I can refer to. My point here is that we all have limitations and vulnerabilities and it’s important we can learn what these are so we can help clients find people with whom they might match better.\nDealing with difficult emotions is crucial to doing this work, but this starts with us knowing ourselves and being open to the ways we can’t help everyone. Once we decide we can help people with complex trauma histories, when we think we can be the right fit, we need to be prepared to deal with countertransference and related emotions that can guide us in helping them.\nCountertransference and the Importance of Therapist’s Emotions\nOur emotions\n\n\n and our ability to acknowledge them to ourselves, within our own consultation/supervision, and to use our feelings as information with our clients are crucial to being effective in our work with people who have survived trauma. Countertransference applies to the feelings we have as therapists in response to the dynamics present in our clients. A definition of countertransference is that it refers to feelings in our clients, which get stirred up in the therapist. These feelings are thought to be an identification with the client’s unconscious material or wishes or with a client’s internal self-representation that takes place in a relational context (Carnochan 2001; Kernberg 1988 ). Our reactions when we are with people we are treating matter because our thoughts and feelings not only lie at the heart of a relational and meaningful encounter but can also provide important clues as to what our clients are experiencing emotionally. In other words, our emotional responses to them help identify what they are experiencing, consciously and unconsciously. As a simple example of this, I might find myself feeling angry with a client while listening to her. One hypothesis regarding this feeling of anger is that, in fact, the client is angry but is unable to be aware of it. The notion of projective identification is one way to explain this. Klein (1975) postulated that unconscious anger gets located in the therapist as an early form of communication. Far from being a magical process in which emotions “get put into” the other, Gabbard (2000) has described this process as a “nudge,” in which clients unconsciously urge the therapist to be cast in a role of some important person from their past. In the case of my client, my anger may not only be reflective of her anger toward myself but also an expression that she expects that others will be angry with her. I also think that as we get more experienced in doing this work, therapists just get incredibly good at anticipating the feelings clients will have as I described previously in this chapter. In fact, as I have gotten older, I don’t really find the aforementioned ideas of Klein or Gabbard to be as compelling as I once did. While I do think it’s true that some clients are perhaps better communicators of thoughts and feelings that are out of awareness, I think more experienced clinicians develop unconscious, complex algorithms based on hundreds of people seen and these experienced therapists can just surmise things more quickly than some younger colleagues.\nThe value in contemporary ideas on countertransference is an increased appreciation of the multiple forms of communication that we are all capable of. Countertransference feelings are particularly useful in working with clients who have difficulty symbolizing. Especially in more vulnerable populations, which include clients with complex PTSD, our emotional responses can help us to acknowledge the extent of vulnerability and fear often present in our clients but which cannot always be verbalized. A large part of the work is the holding and containing of these feelings. I emphasize this because I feel strongly that the majority of things we feel in terms of complicated emotions should be worked through in our own minds (and with the help of colleagues) and rarely spoken when we are with clients. I use my feelings or even dreams about my clients all the time in my own supervision and in my own thinking about clients, but this is to get a sense of what may be going on, not something I need to say to them. To be clear, I am extremely talkative as a therapist, and I voice thoughts and associations, but regarding feelings, I tend to keep those private. It’s always a huge risk when we discuss our personal feelings with clients, and I think ill-advised with most people who have cPTSD, especially when we are getting to know someone.\nWorking with people with cPTSD causes us to face our own vulnerability. In order to not merge with our clients or defensively distance ourselves, we need a heightened awareness of our emotional responses to our clients, as well as an awareness of our feelings about our own histories, including our own traumas. This is not easy to do. And in order to help our traumatized clients, we need to be able to handle all of the complicated feelings our clients bring up, especially the negative feelings we need to bear.\nWinnicott (1949) provided acknowledgment of the fact that we can sometimes feel hatred or anger toward our clients. He stated that therapists should not deny that hatred or other intense feelings exist and that denying hatred in particular can lead to “therapy that is adapted to the needs of the therapist rather than to the needs of the patient” (Winnicott 1949, p. 74). Of course, it’s difficult to acknowledge intense negative feelings toward a client. But if we do not deal with them, we and our clients pay the price. This involves managing our feelings toward individual clients as well as the work in general. Thorne (1989) suggested that therapists who do not acknowledge the difficult and at times grueling nature of our work are mendacious, deluded, or incompetent.\nOur negative feelings can inform our work and need to be felt in order to help mentalize what our clients are going through. At the same time, if we are too overwhelmed with negative feelings, we lose our ability to be truly empathic. I’ve noticed that instead of wading through difficult feelings, sometimes therapists can become super caretakers, which has its own set of costs.\nOver-responsibility and the Trappings of the Super Therapist\nBecoming compulsive about caretaking\n\n\n is likely a way therapists try to avoid overwhelming feelings such as anger, grief, sadness, and loss. Some therapists may suffer from the avoidance symptoms observed in PTSD: they cut off their feelings and become focused on survival—the survival of the people they are caring for and their own survival through the attempt to eliminate difficult feelings. Norcross and VandenBos (2018) suggest that some individuals are drawn to the work of being a therapist guided by a belief that their caring has special or curative powers. This is indeed problematic. However, in many cases, I tend to think of the super therapist as someone who also may have evolved into this role as a way to protect themselves from the intense feelings involved in this work. Paradoxically, it can start through what is often required to become really good at clinical work. Conscientious clinicians get a lot of training; they seek out supervision, their own therapy, consultation groups and classes, read articles to stay abreast of the literature, etc. This is all in addition to seeing clients. Such motivated clinicians do tend to work a lot, as all of the aforementioned activities are non-billable time and/or we pay for them. Most of us do need to work in order to pay our bills, and the extensive hours of professional development and clinical hours add up quickly.\nAdditionally, being with clients involves a lot of isolation, particularly when we are in private practice. We don’t have people to regularly check in with unless we work to make that happen. Confidentiality can be an ongoing burden. In addition to all of the emotions we hold, we also steal away secrets that we can’t just talk to anyone about. A common example of how this strain can manifest is when someone posts too much information about a client situation on listservs. I am on a number of these lists, and even though we are frequently reminded to keep identifying details out of clinical descriptions when asking for referrals, for example, there seem to be inevitable lapses. It’s as if our secrets spill out and way too much identifying detail can be revealed. Spiegel (1990) described the tendency of therapists to split off the emotional impact of their work from the rest of their life. This seems reasonable; we can’t really come home and unload our day onto our family members without risking confidentiality, not to mention burdening them with a host of intense emotions that are hard to understand out of context. Interestingly, there is a body of research within experimental psychology that suggests that holding secrets carries a literal physical burden. For example, one study found that the more burdensome the secret and the more thought devoted to it, people perceived literal distances to be farther, felt physical tasks would require more effort, and were less likely to help others with physical activities. In other words, secret-keepers experience certain ideas similar to carrying physical weight (Slepian et al. 2012 ). As far as I know, this line of research has not looked at the burdens of secrets therapists hold, but confidentiality and the related isolation add further demands on us. The “one-way intimacy” (Norcross and VandenBos 2018) required of our work involves a number of losses. If we stop and think about it, it is a lot to deal with. When a therapist lapses into super therapist mode, they are often preventing themselves from feeling.\nI think that therapists who work all of the time, avoid vacations, see too many clients in one day, and don’t allow realistic breaks between sessions (such as going back to back, which negates biological needs for snacks, water, and using the bathroom) are avoiding thinking about their own needs. They can get caught up in a cycle of caretaking in which the only thing they want to think about is what is on the minds of others. I think that these therapists have a wish that once they are not working, they can fold back into a gratifying emotional life, but I wonder how much this happens. Particularly these days, we all have phones and devices that can alert us to any kind of contact related to our work. How realistic is it that some of us really take time away?\nHalevi and Idisis (2018) found that therapists with a better differentiated sense of self were less likely to develop symptoms of secondary traumatic stress. MacKay (2017) notes that over-responsibility is linked with therapist burnout and secondary traumatic stress. As professional caretakers, we might believe that we can offer better support than anyone else. As some therapists become well known or develop a good reputation for dealing with certain kinds of clients, a kind of compulsive need to work seems to take over for some. Certainly in private practice, there are worries if referrals will keep coming. I’ve sometimes wondered if people who work excessively are worried that if they slow down, their referrals might as well. Further it may be that the more experienced we become, the more complicated and traumatized clients come our way. This is a compliment and a marker of success. But how much work is too much? Just because we are good at something does not mean we should not allow ourselves to say no to referrals or to stop and think what we want our professional lives to look like. For trauma therapists who become compulsive around the work, they can lose their identity as a person and become only a caretaker. In my experience with a number of health professionals, nothing good seems to come from that.\nTherapist Self-Care\nNorcross (2000) noted the lack of research and writing on therapist self-care and described it as “unsettling.” I will describe some of the ways that I have thought about self-care while realizing that this issue is both personal and individualized. I imagine most clinicians have thought about this a lot, and I do not want to suggest my ideas are superior. They are not. I’ll describe what has worked for me, often through modeling what I have observed in senior colleagues who seem to fare well in doing this work long term. However, an excellent book on this topic is one I have referenced several times throughout this chapter. Leaving It at the Office (2nd Ed. Norcross and VandenBos 2018) is a stellar resource. And while its parroted things I have gleaned along the way in my career and will describe below, the book provides longer discussions of many things that I described more briefly in this chapter.\nThe ways we can feel helpless with our clients are a normal part of what witnesses to suffering experience. Compassion fatigue and the development of secondary traumatic stress symptoms may be unavoidable. However, therapists can help themselves by monitoring the tendency toward avoidance of feelings and keeping an eye on a sense of over-responsibility. We bear a great deal of trauma in our work, but by managing our emotions and staying aware of our own symptoms, we can ultimately gain more control. Trauma can remind us not only of how much we need other people to treat us well but also of our own vulnerabilities and the times in our lives in which others put their needs before ours. For some of us, thoughts of our own vulnerability can be terrifying. This seems normal and is a risk inherent in our work and the injured parts of us we bring into our careers.\nWhat I have found most helpful for me in treating traumatized clients is allowing myself to feel the intense emotionality and grief that I encounter in the work. I don’t do this with clients. Although I may feel intense emotions when I am with them and I allow myself to look sad or even slightly tearful at times, a full expression of emotion is something I keep out of the room. It took me a long time to learn how to modulate my emotions with traumatized persons; I used to shut off and overintellectualize in order to move away from intense feelings. I get consultation once a week, and I’ve seen the same consultant for several years, and with him I can express the full extent of my emotions about my clients. I think when I was younger I used to feel that if I had strong emotions about a client, then I must be doing something wrong. I don’t feel this way anymore. In fact, one colleague I really admire mentioned she thinks in some ways we become more emotional as the years go on because we can handle the intensity of emotions brought on in the course of our work. When I deal with my feelings about my clients and the trauma they have been or are being subjected to, I make sure I have safe outlets. For example, I cry sometimes when I talk with my consultant about a particularly sad, tragic, and unfair clinical set of circumstances involving a client. These are sometimes cases when I may be identifying with someone too much and I want to think through my vulnerabilities as well as the reality of a tragic situation. I also talk with my consultant when I feel angry at a client and I can’t quite make sense of it. Choi (2011) found that supportive supervision can lower vicarious traumatization levels. For those working in institutions, a high amount of empowerment within the organization, defined by a sense of meaning, self-efficacy, and self-determination and a sense of agency regarding being able to influence outcomes within their organization, leads to lower levels of traumatic stress (Choi 2017 ). I can feel alone sometimes regarding the intensity of feelings I need to hold, and so my own supervision and access to a professional community, including people I can refer to, are vital to my sense of professional well-being.\nIn addition to acknowledging how we feel and developing a caring professional community, it is important to manage vicarious trauma and compassion fatigue by setting boundaries. Limits and boundaries allow us to stay involved without having to experience the same thing as our clients. When we care for our clients and our work, it can be easy to feel the same things they do. This is the true root of empathic communication. However, it is important to avoid empathic merging. Boundaries are protective. In my practice, I allow myself time between sessions to reset after therapeutic hours that involve a lot of strong emotions. I allow 10–15 minutes between clients. I will up the time between sessions with people who require a lot of me emotionally. For example, I may see someone who is very complicated before lunch. With clients who are especially dissociative, I make sure they are spaced out during all days of the week, and I never see two clients in a row who experience a lot of dissociative processes. Others may be heartier, but I personally need more time to emotionally digest after seeing people who manifest these kinds of cPTSD symptoms. I have found this increases my ability to think and be more present with all of the clients I see in a day.\nI use ideas regarding boundaries to inform how I spend my time away from work. I tend to take a couple vacations a year, at least. And if I find I am thinking too much about work, I try to sort this out myself (by thinking about what emotions are being brought up by the client or clients I am preoccupied with), or I bring it up in consultation. When that has not helped, I get back into therapy.\nRegarding out of session contacts, I explain in writing in my consent form and verbally what the limits of emails and texting are and what constitutes an emergency. I personally do not mind emails that might go into some detail about something that is going on as long as clients understand the inherent confidentiality limitations associated with electronic communications. But I explain there may be a delay in how quickly I get back to them. I also let clients know that if I am busy, they may not get a detailed response from me but that I will be able to think about their email. I realize some colleagues have more stringent limits regarding emails, but I do find that sometimes there can be useful information that can be expressed in writing in between sessions. I explain to clients that texting should be reserved for practice-related details, like appointment changes. If something acute is going on that needs to be addressed, I let people know they can contact me to set up a phone appointment if contact is needed before the next session. In an emergency, I will do this on the same day, but I find it containing for both myself and clients to maintain this level of control regarding contact outside of in-person meetings.\nOther than dealing with my emotions, the other simple practice that has helped me more than anything is to not have my phone with me all of the time. I explain to my clients that when I am covering my practice (which is most of the time if I am not on vacation), I will be unavailable from my phone for a few hours at a time. I will check it, but not every minute. I don’t look at my phone (meaning email, texts, or calls) when I am exercising, when I am running errands, when I am in nature (which is mostly at the beach with my dogs), or when I am with friends or family for meals. For me, I can get too distracted by my phone, and this interferes when I am trying to connect with people outside of work. My phone keeps me from being in the present moment, and so I had to develop boundaries around it. Others may need something different, but this is what works for me.\nNot surprisingly, mindfulness is found to be protective of compassion fatigue (Turgoose and Maddox 2017 ). Mindfulness integrates several self-care strategies that impact the body, provides boundaries between our clients and ourselves, and helps to quiet our own anxious and unquiet minds (Norcross and VandenBos 2018 ). Formal mindfulness can be a struggle, but it starts with trying to be present in moments both inside and outside of work. It should be noted that modern mindfulness apps have meditations as short as 3 minutes, so the truly mindfully motivated among us could even practice this between clients. I have a ways to go in terms of this admirable goal, but I try to do an informal body scan at least once a day to notice what is going on in my body and where I am tense. Other helpful mindfulness strategies involve paying attention to our breathing when we are with clients and grounding ourselves in our bodies.\nIn order to survive the trauma in our work, we need good relationships outside of the office. As gratifying as our work can be, we need others where we can have more than one-way intimacy. I think an important aspect of close interpersonal relationships outside of work is that we can be involved with people who don’t idealize us or see us as an expert and who hold us to account as normal people who have good and negative aspects. Our relationships are not only grounding, they feed us, which is extremely important when we spend our professional lives taking care of others.\nConclusion\nAs gratifying as it is, there is a price we pay for doing this work. It is stressful and demanding, and if we are not careful, we can become too traumatized to think with people who desperately need our help. Although it is a lot of work to become skilled in our fields, it’s important that we avoid the trappings of being a super therapist. Our vulnerabilities are as important as our strengths, and we should recognize both, including how our own backgrounds may make us especially empathic but also at risk in certain clinical situations. We teach assertiveness and self-care to our clients, but this can feel empty and unrewarding if we fail to set limits ourselves. Thinking seriously about our self-care, including engaging in our own therapy and supervision, is crucial to aging well when working with traumatized populations. Our work can be lonely and isolating. We need to develop a professional community with people who can remind us of the challenges and rewards of this work and personal relationships with people with whom we can be ourselves, with the reality of imperfect selves exposed. We need safety as much as our clients do and we have to work hard to achieve that. And though I will say this again in my suggested interventions below, perhaps the best thing we can do to preserve ourselves in our line of work is this: When things are going well at work, when you really can tell you have helped someone, stop and allow yourself to recognize how amazing it is that you’ve probably overcome something difficult in order for you to help someone else in need.\nSelf-Care Interventions\nBe thoughtful about caseload\n\n. For example, if certain clients pose challenges, limit the numbers of these kinds of clients if possible.\nReally take time to think about the structure of your day if you have the luxury of controlling it.\nIf certain clients are triggering, space them throughout the week and/or allow longer breaks after challenging clients.\nTake real breaks from work. Not just vacations but times when clients are not being thought about.\nIf you suddenly become “famous” in your community and everyone wants to refer to you, take it with a grain of salt. There are many talented clinicians around.\nIt’s nice to be successful, but long-term success involves a measured pace, not a hurried one.\nGood therapists will always have referrals. Saying no to referrals won’t close your practice.\nEngage in activities that don’t have to do with client care.\nDevelop creative pursuits. Therapists often are very talented at many kinds of artistic endeavors.\nExercise. It’s the most powerful treatment for depression and very helpful for anxiety and stress.\nConsider spending time in nature, even if it’s just having lunch in a park on a nice day.\nConsider frequent consultation, either individually or in a group.\nConsider seeking a therapist, even if you’ve had therapy before.\nIf you start to feel overly responsible, can’t stop thinking about work, then really consider getting back into therapy.\nNurture relationships, whether with a partner or other family and friends.\nAnimals are amazing healers. If you like animals, consider getting a pet if you don’t already have one. Or find ways to see them in nature or volunteer in organizations that care for animals.\nSpend time thinking about the kinds of people who can take care of you when you need it.\nMany of us in the field often have one-sided relationships. Find people who need you but whom you can need.\nIf meditation works for you, do it often.\nThink about your relationship with electronic devices and social media. Both can lead to compulsive behaviors and lower quality of life.\nCommunicate to clients right away what your limits are regarding out of office contact. It’s more than important for risk management and clinical reasons; it relates to thinking about the realities of your availability and what you are comfortable with.\nWhen things are going well at work, when you really can tell you have helped someone, stop and allow yourself to recognize how amazing it is that you’ve probably overcome something difficult in order for you to help someone else in need.\nReferences\nArmstrong, K.

They have also seen people grieving the loss of a loved one and not being able to have funerals.\nHow Physical Healthcare Workers Can Experience Vicarious Trauma\nNurses, doctors and other medical providers have also been hit hard this past year.\n“Medical providers can experience vicarious trauma when treating someone who was in a tragic accident or who has an illness. It’s a little bit different from the mental health side, but it’s a similar phenomenon,” Steve said. “They’re exposed to people going through a really hard time, and they’re trying to help them.”\nThe COVID-19 pandemic introduced a set of challenges that made things even harder for physical healthcare workers. Workers didn’t have enough personal protective equipment at the beginning of the pandemic. They have had to worry about contracting the virus while working on the front lines. And they have seen people get sick without improvement and witnessed individuals die in isolation.\nHow to Create Well-Being for Yourself\nWhether you are helping people through emotional, psychological or physical tragedies, being proactive about self-care can help you prevent and cope with vicarious trauma.\nConduct a self-assessment of your core beliefs, professional skills and goals. Then, create a well-being plan that addresses the physical, psychological, career, intellectual, spiritual, interpersonal, financial, environmental and community dimensions of your life.\n“During the pandemic, the normal ways I created well-being for myself haven’t always been sufficient, so I have had to reevaluate my well-being plan and up my game,” Steve said. “Make necessary changes to your plan that allow you to still have well-being in your life while you’re in the middle of a pandemic serving others.”\nPart of that well-being plan can include professional help by seeing a therapist or utilizing your organization’s employee assistance plan.

Therapists and counselors as well as emergency crews, law enforcement officers, physicians, and judges, and lawyers may be vulnerable to vicarious trauma. Any individual who has a close connection with a trauma victim may be subjected to secondary traumatization.\nIn the course of their job, therapists as well as other caregivers regularly hear stories of horrible events. Hearing these stories can sometimes frustrate them, causing them to feel, on a lesser scale, the same emotions as the trauma victims in their care. The helper’s perspective is usually shifted as a result of vicarious trauma. Constant exposure to painful material, for example, may modify and/or impair the helper’s perceptions and beliefs.\nWhat is Abandonment Trauma?\nBurnout and compassion fatigue are related ideas that have some parallels to vicarious trauma, and a person may experience one or more of these states simultaneously. Compassion fatigue is physical and emotional exhaustion that occurs when people who serve others feel compassion for those they aid but do not have enough time to recover and look for themselves. It differs from vicarious trauma in that this is not always accompanied by trauma-related symptoms and does not always result in changes in one’s perspective.\nAlthough burnout and vicarious trauma are often used indiscriminately, this condition does not always have a traumatic component. People might become burned out if they work in a toxic atmosphere or if they feel they are doing a monotonous or otherwise difficult job without adequate time for rest or proper self-care. All helping professions may be in danger, but those who deal with kids and victims of sexual harassment and abuse may be more vulnerable to vicarious trauma.\nVicarious trauma symptoms\nExamples of vicarious Trauma\nCauses of Vicarious Trauma\nHow to avoid vicarious traumatization\nHow to deal with vicarious Trauma\nTreatment for vicarious Trauma\nFAQs\nWhat is the definition of vicarious traumatization?\nWhat is the difference between vicarious trauma and secondary trauma?", "(PDF) Strategies for Reducing Secondary or Vicarious Trauma: Do They Work? | Cheryl Regehr - Academia.edu\nDownload Free PDF\nStrategies for Reducing Secondary or Vicarious Trauma: Do They Work?\nBrief Treatment and Crisis Intervention, 2006\nCheryl Regehr\nDownload\nFull PDF Package\nThis Paper\nA short summary of this paper\n37 Full PDFs related to this paper\nRead Paper\nDownload\nDownload Full PDF Package\nTranslate PDF\nBrief Treatment and Crisis Intervention Advance Access published December 30, 2005\n\n\n\n\n          Strategies for Reducing Secondary or\n          Vicarious Trauma: Do They Work?\n\n                Ted Bober, MSW\n                Cheryl Regehr, PhD\n\n\n\n          This cross-sectional design study sought to assess whether therapists believed and engaged\n          in commonly recommended forms of prevention for secondary and vicarious trauma\n          and whether engaging in these activities resulted in lower levels of distress. In this study\n          of 259 therapists, time spent with counseling trauma victims was the best predictor of\n          trauma scores. Although participants generally believed in the usefulness of recommended\n          coping strategies including leisure activities, self-care activities and supervision, these\n          beliefs did not translate into time devoted to engaging in the activities. Most importantly,\n          there was no association between time devoted to coping strategies and traumatic\n          stress scores. Intervention strategies for trauma counselors that focus on education of\n          therapists and augmenting coping skills unduly individualize the problem.\n\n            KEY WORDS: secondary traumatic stress, vicarious trauma, coping, self-care, supervision.\n\n\n\nAttention to the impact on individuals of expo-               to describe this phenomenon are varied, but the\nsure to catastrophic or life-threatening events               most common include secondary traumatic\nover the past 30 years has resulted in new                    stress and vicarious trauma.

This work-related trauma exposure can occur from such experiences as listening to individual clients recount their victimization; looking at videos of exploited children; reviewing case files; hearing about or responding to the aftermath of violence and other traumatic events day after day; and responding to mass violence incidents that have resulted in numerous injuries and deaths.\nWhat Happens to Those Exposed to Vicarious Trauma?\nThe Vicarious Trauma Toolkit (VTT) introduces a new model for examining and conceptualizing the impact of vicarious trauma and the reactions and experiences of victim service providers and first responders. The VTT also introduces the roles and responsibilities of organizations in addressing the negative impact of this occupational challenge on their employees.\nWhile individuals respond to vicarious trauma in a number of ways, a change in their world-view is considered inevitable —people can either become more cynical or fearful, or they can become more appreciative of what they have, or both. Responses to vicarious trauma can be negative, neutral, or positive; can change over time; and can vary from individual to individual, particularly with prolonged exposure. The chart below illustrates the VTT Model.\nVicarious traumatization is a negative reaction to trauma exposure and includes a range of psychosocial symptoms. (In the VTT, the term “vicarious traumatization” is used broadly to include other related terms such as secondary traumatic stress (STS), compassion fatigue (CF), and critical incident stress (CIS). These terms, often used interchangeably, have distinct and overlapping definitions, as illustrated in the Glossary of Terms .)\nA neutral reaction signifies the ways that an individual's resilience, experiences, support, and coping strategies manage the traumatic material, not that it has no effect.\nVicarious resilience and vicarious transformation are newer concepts reflecting the positive effects of this work. For instance, individuals may draw inspiration from a victim’s resilience that strengthens their own mental and emotional fortitude. Just as victims can be transformed in positive ways by their trauma, so can victim service providers and first responders.\nCompassion satisfaction reflects the sense of meaning that is gained from working in the fields of victim services and first responders. Such positive outcomes can motivate and, in turn, protect against the negative effects of trauma exposure.\nWho Is at Risk of Being Affected by Vicarious Trauma?\nAnyone working with survivors of trauma and violence is at risk of being negatively impacted by the varied effects of vicarious trauma. Factors that may make employees or volunteers more vulnerable to this occupational risk include—\nprior traumatic experiences;\nsocial isolation, both on and off the job;\na tendency to avoid feelings, withdraw, or assign blame to others in stressful situations;\ndifficulty expressing feelings;\nlack of preparation, orientation, training, and supervision in their jobs;\nbeing newer employees and less experienced at their jobs;\nconstant and intense exposure to trauma with little or no variation in work tasks; and\nlack of an effective and supportive process for discussing traumatic content of the work.\nWhat Are Some Common Negative Reactions to Vicarious Trauma?\nEach individual may experience the effects of vicarious trauma differently. Some of the potential negative reactions include, but are not limited to—\ndifficulty managing emotions;\nfeeling emotionally numb or shut down;\nfatigue, sleepiness, or difficulty falling asleep;\nphysical problems or complaints, such as aches, pains, and decreased resistance to illness;\nbeing easily distracted, which can increase one’s risk of accidents;\nloss of a sense of meaning in life and/or feeling hopeless about the future;\nrelationship problems (e.g., withdrawing from friends and family, increased interpersonal conflicts, avoiding intimacy);\nfeeling vulnerable or worrying excessively about potential dangers in the world and loved ones’ safety;\nincreased irritability; aggressive, explosive, or violent outbursts and behavior;\ndestructive coping or addictive behaviors (e.g., over/under eating, substance abuse, gambling, taking undue risks in sports or driving);\nlack of or decreased participation in activities that used to be enjoyable;\navoiding work and interactions with clients or constituents; and\na combination of symptoms that comprise a diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\nSuggestions for Coworkers\nIf you believe a coworker might be experiencing negative reactions to vicarious trauma, consider—\nreaching out and talking to them individually about the impact of the work;\nhelping them establish a consistent work-to-home transition that creates an important boundary and safe place outside the workplace;\nencouraging them to attend to the basics—sleep, healthy eating, hygiene, and exercise;\nsupporting connections with family, friends, and coworkers;\nreferring them to organizational supports such as a peer support team, employee assistance program, or chaplain; and\nencouraging them to discuss their experience with their supervisor.\nSuggestions for Supervisors\nThe VTT includes a number of suggestions for supervisors of individuals who may be experiencing vicarious trauma, including—\ndiscussing vicarious trauma as part of supervision;\nallowing flexible work schedules, recognizing the need for and protecting down time, while staying attuned to the possibility of withdrawal or isolation;\ncreating time and a physical space at work for reflection through reading, writing, prayer, and meditation, among other activities; and\nreferring to therapeutic and professional assistance, when appropriate.\nSuggestions for Family Members\nFamily members of victim service providers and first responders are also often affected by work-related trauma exposure. In addition to the suggestions offered above, consider these additional ways to address your own needs and those of your family:\nShare your concerns and develop supportive strategies with your loved one.\nDo your best not to take your loved one’s reactions personally; remind yourself that what your loved one may be experiencing is related to the job, not you.\nMaintain daily life routines (predictability helps).\nStay connected with family and friends.\nDiscuss the demands of your loved one’s job and its impact with other family members, including responding to children’s questions in an age-appropriate manner.\nTake time to engage in social, creative, and self-care activities such as reading, writing, prayer, and meditation.\nSeek therapeutic or professional assistance, when needed.\nFor More Information About Vicarious Trauma\nThe VTT has a number of resources to help you further understand vicarious trauma, its prevalence, and its impact on those working in victim services, emergency medical services, fire services, law enforcement, and other allied professions.

A negative mental health outcome on human service professionals includes compassion fatigue, which is made up of burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Secondary traumatic stress (STS) symptoms occur when an empathetic helper is exposed to another person’s trauma. Personal symptoms mimic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\nContents\nSecondary traumatic stress\nOccupational exposure to vicarious trauma\nWork-related vicarious trauma\nRecognize vicarious trauma symptoms\nEmployers can help build resiliency\nImproving a workplace environment\nPrevent compassion fatigue\nIncorporate resilience training\nSecondary traumatic stress\nSecondary traumatic stress can occur in those who are new to trauma and mental health work, don’t get enough training, or have past traumas that have not been worked through. Secondary traumatic stress and posttraumatic stress disorder have overlapping characteristics that are similar to vicarious trauma. Vicarious trauma is a psychological response that is associated with the disturbing experiences and traumatic events of another person, often victims or crime or abuse. The condition describes the indirect trauma or the result of identifying with a trauma survivor’s suffering.\nOccupational exposure\nI define trauma as when a person experiences an extremely stressful loss event or a repeated loss event that strongly affects their ability to cope. Occupational exposure to a person’s traumatic material can bring about a psychological response. An empathetic and engaged professional can embody a trauma survivor’s traumatic experience.\nAlthough health and mental health practitioners can experience compassion satisfaction and vicarious post traumatic growth, they can also experience vicarious traumatization. This can happen while listening to a detailed narrative of people who have experienced trauma, ongoing exposure to the re-telling of traumatized events, or responding to a traumatic event. An actual shift in intrapersonal processes occurs when addressing vicarious trauma that is work-related.\nWork-related exposure\nWork-related trauma exposure is a potentially distressing situation for a human services worker who is confronted with highly complex topics (e.g. suicidality, physical abuse, sexual assault, mass violence). Those at a high risk for vicarious traumatization include clinicians researchers and educators, those who work in first responder agencies, law enforcement, fire services, child protective services, victim services, the courts, school systems, and mental health.\nWhen a professional helper experiences secondary trauma, they experience changes in their world view, their role, and their perception of self. A sense of self gives them purpose in life when working in trauma-based services. They view their world based on how they grew up, and what they learned in life. When their sense of self deeply changes, their values and personal identify change with it. They become vicariously traumatized.\nRecognize traumatization symptoms\nWhat is vicarious trauma? Symptoms include anxiety, anger, feeling isolated, depressed, unsafe, hopelessness, numbness, irritability, emotionally numb, losing control, not trusting others, powerless, fear, worried about a loved one’s safety, more sensitive to violence, being cynical, inattention, easily distracted, intrusive imagery, overwhelming negative changes in looking at one’s world, becoming forgetful about important details, loss of appetite, fatigue, risky behavior, can’t separate personal life from professional life, addictive behaviors, not wanting to talk with others about work, becoming aggressive, trouble with workplace boundaries, headaches, heartburn, loss of hope, and loss of meaning in life.\nEmployers can help build resiliency\nBeing that organizational factors influence psycho-social well-being, employers can mitigate the impact of traumatic stress before it wears away at an employee’s motivation to stay in their job. To build workforce resiliency, an employee retention strategy should focus fostering resilience and trauma treatment to prevent employee turnover and negative work environments. To function at maximum capacity when dealing with second-hand trauma, employers need to stress trauma training and self-care, and help employees develop coping mechanisms.\nEmployers can be proactive as they provide professional support and professional development, and a vicarious trauma toolkit. The organizational culture needs to focus on an approach to help employees, whether that is giving them additional resources and training, or educating them within the workplace about effective self-care.\nHow to Come Out of Vicarious Trauma, Your Own Trauma, and Compassion Fatigue in a Positive Way\nWatch on\nImproving a workplace environment\nTo improve the workplace environment and stress organizational goals that focus on employee self-care, supervisors need to do the following: during orientation supply material about compassion fatigue and burnout, including a list of factors that contribute to distress in professionals who work with complex trauma survivors; pair a new employee with a mentor who has been on the job for a while; create a workplace culture that stresses shared norms around self-care; allow employees flexible working arrangements whether a compressed work week or flextime; and express an understanding of what a day is like working with those who are traumatized and how hard that is.\nEmployers can tell workers that they understand self-sacrifice and their guilty feelings of not working when they are at home; never allow those who work with trauma survivors to sacrifice their own well-being and self-care for that of those they support; provide trauma-informed care; give them permission to take care of themselves; show appreciation by offering occasional perks; connect with each employee on a regular basis; don’t wait for an annual review to discuss resilience and recovery; offer professional development on trauma and mental health management; and help employees be cognitively aware of the impact of vicarious trauma.\nPrevent compassion fatigue\nSupervision, training in emotional labor, and a team climate mitigate the impact of secondary trauma. To prevent compassion fatigue and burnout and increase job satisfaction, service providers need to practice self-care, which is a vital strategy to minimize the risk of vicarious trauma and build resilience. Employers need to motivate employees to focus on self-care to mitigate the impact of vicarious trauma and posttraumatic stress.\nThe right motivational keynote speaker understands how to put things in the proper perspective while enlightening professionals about new and inventive ways to foster resilience. Barbara offers the skills necessary to deal with selfcare issues for clinicians and how to develop a self-care plan. Being a keynote speaker on traumatic -bereavement-informed care, addressing vicarious traumatization, and mental well-being, means more than simply firing up a group of people about fostering resilience. It is about recognizing how aversive details of a client’s traumatic experiences has a long-lasting impact on a professional’s personal beliefs and world view.\nIncorporate training\nContact Barbara today to learn more about burnout, secondary traumatic stress, resilience and recovery, compassion fatigue, and vicarious traumatization and incorporate trauma training in your program curricula.", "Vicarious Trauma Management | Support for Therapy Workers\nVicarious Traumatisation Management\nSupervision & Consultation | Vicarious Traumatisation Management | Resources\nSupport for workers – Vicarious Trauma\nRepeated exposure to narratives of trauma, exploring other peoples experiences of abuse and neglect – bearing witness to others’ distress, prolonged reading about traumatic experiences can adversely affect us as workers.\nVicarious traumatisation (VT) is an inescapable effect of trauma work. The degree, duration and frequency of exposure to that type of secondary trauma vary from work place to workplace. Thus the range of negative, cumulative effects that can develop overtime will vary as well.\nWhen we empathically engage with a person in distress, our bodies instinctively respond to what our brain, or more precisely, the limbic system, senses as threat or danger. When our sympathetic nervous system (a branch of the autonomic nervous system) becomes activated, the body responds getting ready for defensive action. The heart rate increases, our breathing changes, muscles tighten; we can feel hot or cold, tense or nauseated. It’s important to remember that this is an automatic response.\nThe trauma literature suggests only one variable reliably predicts the risk of VT: repeated exposure to traumatic material. Repeated exposure can intensify the body’s natural response and subsequently impact on how we think about ourselves, our relationships, others and the world.\nThe negative impact of secondary trauma exposure can resolve without lasting negative effects particularly if you recognise it and attend to it by utilising effective self-care strategies and accessing support.\nIt seems that minimising and ignoring unwelcome physical, emotional and cognitive consequences of the work is not uncommon among trauma workers. Not noticing one’s own distress because the work is satisfying and going well is just one reason. The agency culture where using deficit language such as ‘weak’, ‘over sensitive’ ‘not coping’, ‘not up to it’, to describe workers who admit to feeling, for example, very anxious about seeing some clients, is another.\nOur knowledge about the nature of vicarious traumatisation has been expanding for over 20 years. Sadly, in many work places, overtly or covertly, the deficit view still exists. When even a suggestion of accessing assistance through an EAP counsellor can feel stigmatising, paying attention to early VT warning signs is not a priority. In the short term, not speaking up may feel like the safest strategy. Over time, the cumulative impact of vicarious trauma, unacknowledged and not responded to, will get stronger.\nUnaddressed symptoms of vicarious traumatisation do not dissipate spontaneously. They can jeopardise your health impacting your personal and professional life.\nPlease check the Practitioner profiles for individual and agency support.

{"query_id": "2024-216592", "generated_response": "Disability insurance is considered a smart investment for several compelling reasons, based on both statistical evidence and practical financial protection benefits:\n\n## Protects Your Most Valuable Asset\n\nYour ability to earn income is likely your greatest financial asset. If you make $75,000 annually, that represents $375,000 in earning potential over just five years [5]. Disability insurance protects this asset, which is often more valuable than your home, car, or other insured possessions [5].\n\n## Higher Risk Than You Might Think\n\nThe statistics reveal disability is more common than many people realize:\n- About 25% of today's 20-year-olds will become disabled at some point before reaching age 67 [2]\n- At age 35, you have a 50% chance of experiencing a disability lasting 3+ months before age 65 [12][14]\n- One in seven workers will become disabled for five years or more before retirement [10][12]\n- Disability risk is 2-4 times higher than death risk for people aged 30-50 [12][14]\n\n## Government Benefits Are Inadequate\n\nSocial Security Disability Insurance has significant limitations:\n- 65% of initial SSDI applications are denied [10]\n- Average monthly SSDI benefit is only about $1,130-$1,234 [9][10]\n- Benefits only apply to severe disabilities expected to last at least one year [9]\n- No coverage for temporary or partial disabilities [9]\n\n## Prevents Financial Catastrophe\n\nDisability insurance helps you avoid severe financial consequences:\n- Disability is a leading cause of bankruptcy and accounts for nearly 50% of home foreclosures [2][14]\n- 80% of workers would exhaust their savings within two months without income [14]\n- Helps you continue meeting mortgage, car payments, and other obligations [5]\n\n## Illness, Not Just Accidents\n\nContrary to popular belief, 90% of disabilities result from illness rather than accidents [10][11]. Common causes include cancer, heart disease, mental health issues, pregnancy complications, and musculoskeletal disorders [2][11].\n\n## Reasonable Cost for Protection\n\nDisability insurance typically costs 1-3% of your annual salary [9][10]. This relatively modest expense provides substantial financial protection, making it cost-effective income protection [9].\n\n## Tax Advantages\n\nIf you purchase individual disability insurance with after-tax dollars, the benefits you receive are generally tax-free, potentially allowing you to maintain close to your current take-home pay [1][3].\n\n## Enables Focus on Recovery\n\nHaving disability insurance removes financial stress, allowing you to focus on recovery without rushing back to work prematurely, which can actually aid in better health outcomes [5].\n\nDisability insurance is particularly crucial if you're the primary breadwinner, self-employed, paying off significant debt, or lack adequate employer coverage [6]. It's not technically an \"investment\" that generates returns, but rather essential financial protection for your income-earning ability [4].", "citations": ["https://www.schwabmoneywise.com/resource-center/insights/essentials/disability-insurance", "https://www.moneyunder30.com/disability-insurance-is-it-worth-it\n", "https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/taxes-insurance/46724/", "https://www.insurancelibrary.com/disability-insurance/is-long-term-disability-insurance-a-good-investment", "https://www.meetbreeze.com/disability-insurance/pros-and-cons-of-disability-insurance/\n", "https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/who-needs-disability-insurance", "https://www.nationalonlineinsuranceschool.com/insurance-license-blog/2014/04/5-reasons-to-have-disability-insurance/", "http://www.insuranceqna.com/disability-insurance/pros-and-cons-of-disability-insurance.html", "https://connectionsfinancialadvisors.com/purchase-disability-insurance/", "https://www.consumerreports.org/money/disability-insurance-protect-your-income-in-a-health-crisis/", "https://www.guardianlife.com/disability-insurance\n", "https://ezinearticles.com/?Why-Disability-Insurance?-Chances-Of-Becoming-Disabled-Are-Greater-Than-Your-Chances-Of-Not&id=208884", "https://www.guardianlife.com/disability-insurance/study/financial-wellness/role-of-disability-insurance", "https://disabilityinsuranceadvisor.com/statisticsandfactsaboutdisabilityinsurance/"], "contexts": ["Schwab MoneyWise | Disability Insurance\nDisability Insurance\nProtecting your greatest asset.\nOur two cents\nIf you have a high income and/or a physically demanding job, disability insurance is an especially smart investment. Taxes aren't deducted from private disability insurance, so in the event that you're injured, you might receive close to 100% of what you take home now.\nThe probability of being disabled at any particular time is much higher than the likelihood of dying. Yet many people who wouldn't dream of going without life insurance don't understand the importance of disability income insurance.\nThrough disability insurance, people with high incomes can generally find policies that will replace 30–60 percent of their income should they become disabled. Middle-income people might find coverage for replacement of 50–75 percent of their income. It's generally not possible to replace 100 percent of your income.\nWhat does the government provide?\nThere are a variety of government disability programs:\nSocial Security disability insurance pays benefits to qualified individuals under age 65.\nSupplemental Security Income pays benefits if you are over 65.\nAll states offer workers' compensation, but only if your injury or illness is work related.\nMilitary personnel are entitled to veterans' benefits only if their disabilities are service related. If you're injured in a traffic accident or at home, you may be out of work—and out of an income.\nWhat qualifies as a disability?\nFor insurance purposes, you're considered disabled only if you meet the insurance policy's criteria. While there are many definitions, it all hinges on how an illness or injury affects your ability to work, or how it affects your ability to earn income. When you purchase a disability policy, make sure you understand what's covered.\nTwo types of disability insurance\nThere are two main types of disability insurance:\nShort-term policies cover disabilities that last for a few weeks or months.\nLong-term policies can provide coverage for anywhere from two to five years, or even until you reach age 65.\nIf your employer offers a disability insurance policy, it is most likely short term. In this case you may want to purchase additional long-term coverage on your own. This will also protect you in case you leave your job.\nHow much coverage do you need?\nStart by determining how much money you need each month to pay your bills if you become disabled. Policies generally won't cover more than about two-thirds of your gross earnings. However, if you buy your own policy you won't have to pay taxes on your disability checks. That means that your take-home pay would be about the same.\nThings to consider when buying a plan\nIf you become disabled, you'll have to wait a certain amount of time (the elimination period) before you receive benefits. Once you start receiving benefits, you'll get them for a certain amount of time (the benefit period). The shorter the waiting period or the longer the benefit period, the higher the premium.\nA cost-of-living clause will increase your benefits with inflation. Having this provision will increase your premiums.\nA non-cancelable policy can't be canceled, and the company cannot change the benefit or the premium.\nA guaranteed renewable policy can't be canceled, BUT the company can adjust the premium.\n(1109-10800)", "Why Disability Insurance Is The Most Important Financial Product You Didn't Realize You Needed\nHome\n»\nInsurance\n»\nWhy Disability Insurance Is The Most Important Financial Product You Didn’t Realize You Needed\nWhy Disability Insurance Is The Most Important Financial Product You Didn't Realize You Needed\nWritten by\nEric Rosenberg |\nModified date: Feb. 2, 2022\nWhen you think about the insurance that you need, disability insurance might not be at the top of your list, but it should be.

Most people are wise to purchase both short-term and long-term disability insurance, as coverage for long-term disability may take six months to kick in. Short-term disability, as the name implies, starts faster than long-term coverage.\nAccording to the nonprofit Council for Disability Awareness, the most common causes of short-term disability claims are:\nPregnancy.\nMusculoskeletal disorders.\nDigestive disorders.\nMental health issues, and injuries.\nLong-term disability claims most commonly stem from musculoskeletal disorders, cancer, pregnancy, mental health issues, and injuries.\nDisability is a common cause of bankruptcy. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Workers’ Compensation may offer some benefits to someone with a disability, but they may not offer enough income to pay for everything you need. Disability insurance is an important backup plan if you can’t go to work and need to keep up your income while recovering.\nRead more: Disability Insurance – Everything You Need To Know\nIs it worth it?\nNot everyone needs disability insurance. In fact, I recently spoke to an insurance broker who said I could probably avoid buying it because, as a freelance writer, there is little chance I could become so disabled that I could not work at all. Even if I broke my arm, I could use voice dictation to type out my articles.\nHowever, disability insurance is a necessity for other people – especially those who work manual labor jobs. If you work in an injury-prone profession, you should definitely invest in disability insurance.\nDisability insurance is like life insurance. If your family doesn’t rely on your income, then you probably don’t need to buy it. Clint Haynes CFP® of NextGen Wealth said he recommends disability insurance to about half of his clients, depending on their careers and their personal situations. He goes on to say:\n“If you’re the breadwinner, you better have some disability insurance,”\nWhy is disability insurance so important?\nDisability insurance replaces your income if you get seriously ill\nSome of those most common disability insurance claims relate to cancer, musculoskeletal disorders, and depression. While you hopefully never have to deal with any of these unfortunate situations, they are quite common.\nIn fact, one of them is affecting my family right now. My dad is receiving disability insurance payments related to prostate cancer. My family never expected my dad to get a stage four cancer diagnosis at any point, but here we are. I’m so glad for my parent’s finances that they had this critical insurance coverage. You just never know when a major illness could strike.\nDisability insurance replaces income if you are severely injured\nMany professions carry a high likelihood of injury. If you do any kind of manual labor, your body is essential in your ability to earn an income. Construction, factory, and other manual jobs could lead to injury at work. While your employer’s insurance should cover some of your bills, it may not be enough.\nYou could also fall victim to a surprise injury. A slip and fall on an icy sidewalk, a car accident that isn’t your fault, a fall off a ladder, and other surprises could put you on the sidelines. You don’t get hurt on purpose. That’s why it’s called an accident.\nDisability insurance could provide enough income to cover bills while recovering\nHopefully, if you do need disability insurance, it isn’t a permanent disability. Most disability insurance pays around 60% of your income. So if you normally make $4,000 per month, your disability insurance would pay $2,400 per month. That is a long-shot from what you made before but hopefully is enough to get by when factoring in emergency savings.\nThe Social Security Administration says that about 25% of people who are 20 years old today will be disabled at some point before reaching age 67. That’s too high of a chance to ignore.\nRead more: Emergency Funds: Everything You Need To Know\nDisability insurance may kick in if you can still work but not in the same capacity\nDisability insurance generally comes with “any occupation” or “own occupation” rules. This determines what level of disability could qualify you for benefits.\nWith “any occupation” coverage, which is probably going to be cheaper for you, your insurance only starts if you can’t reasonably do any job. That means you could have to work somewhere else, or perhaps in a lower-wage position, if you are still physically able to work.\n“Own occupation” means your insurance will pay if you are disabled and can’t do your own job, regardless of whether you can do something else. This is ideal, as you are probably best trained and have the best income prospects with your own job.\nDisability insurance complements Social Security Disability Insurance\nSocial Security Disability Insurance is disability insurance you already have as a US taxpayer, but qualifying and receiving benefits is not easy.\nIf you do qualify and receive SSDI, it likely won’t be enough to cover all of your monthly expenses. The non-blind disability benefit for 2020 is $1,260 per month, according to the Social Security Administration.\nIf you have your own disability insurance, you could get SSDI as well. The combination of both insurance plans may take you well above 60% of your regular income.\nDisability insurance covers short-term and long-term needs\nThe two main kinds of disability insurance you will come across are short-term and long-term. The names do a pretty good job of explaining how they work.\nShort-term disability usually works for a period of three to six months. After that, you’ll need a long-term disability policy.\nRead more: Do You Need Short-Term Disability Insurance?\nLong-term disability insurance usually has a three or six-month waiting period before benefits begin. The length of the benefit period is a big factor in the policy price. These often come in periods of two, five, or 10 years, or until retirement.\nDisability insurance protects your household from a complete loss of income\nIf you think going down to 60% of your income sounds tough, imagine it dropping to $0. Unless you have significant savings or a spouse with a paycheck that can carry the household’s needs, a disability could be dire. Those with disabilities may have to give up their home and move in with relatives. It could lead to relying on others completely to get by.\nWith disability insurance, things are not necessarily easy. If disabled, however, getting disability insurance benefits is a lot better than not having the option.\nWhere to get disability insurance\nMany people get disability insurance through their employer. This is a great benefit, but may not be enough.\nYou could end up changing to a job without disability insurance or become self-employed, in which case you would need disability insurance of your own.\nTo find disability insurance, start with an insurance marketplace like Policygenius. By doing this, you can compare quotes from multiple different insurers and be confident that you are picking the right policy for your financial needs.\nSummary\nInsurance is there for those bad situations you can’t predict. Just as life insurance is an important protection for your family if you were to pass away, disability insurance is an important protection for a time when you may be unable to work.\nWhile disability insurance is arguably more important to people who are more likely to become injured or otherwise disabled, it’s a good idea for anyone who relies on their monthly income.\nRead more:\nShould You Get Disability Insurance and Is It Worth It?\nDo You Need Short-Term Disability Insurance?\n#Subscribe\nSave Your First - Or NEXT -  $100,000\nAbout the author\n13\nEric Rosenberg\nEric Rosenberg is a finance, travel, and technology writer in Ventura, California.

If you are no longer able to earn an income, but still have spending needs, then you can end up being a burden on your loved ones. The loss of an income can be financially devastating if not properly planned for; having a safety net can make a lot of sense, particularly for families with a sole breadwinner.\nWho Should Have Disability Insurance\nTypically, all employed people should consider this type of insurance. Because its main purpose is to replace income lost due to a disability, it’s good for self-employed individuals, households with a nonworking spouse, and people without an employer sponsored policy. Disability insurance is usually structured to replace 60%-70% of monthly income. You can choose the length of your elimination period (the period between injury and receipt of benefit payments); although 90 days is the most common length, you should choose an elimination period that aligns with your emergency savings.\nDisability Insurance & Employment\nCompanies may also take policies out on “key” employees, which is called “Key-Person Disability” insurance. This type of disability insurance aims to financially protect a company in the case that a key employee becomes disabled. If you are self-employed, you can buy disability insurance for yourself and can write it off as a business expense.\nIt’s especially important if you are self-employed to have this type of insurance, since your business likely would struggle to function in the event you are not able to work, and you need this as income replacement. It can also be very useful for one-income families or those with tight cash flows.\nShort-Term Disability Insurance\nShort-term disability coverage, which typically provides coverage for less than a year, is often packaged as an employee benefit, and offered through your workplace. If you have a company-paid plan, then the disability payments received will be taxable. Premiums are usually based on age, job title, health, elimination period desired, monthly benefit desired, and length of coverage.\nLong-Term Care Insurance\nLong-term disability insurance is usually purchased privately. The claim may last from one-to-three years, but when you purchase the policy, you have the option to choose multiple benefit durations. These can range from two years, all the way to the age of 70. This will affect the cost of your policy, but it’s something you can elect at the time you purchase it. Individual policies are a tax-free benefit if paid for by the insured.\nRead our Free Personal Capital Insurance Guide\nPersonal Capital Insurance Series\nLife Insurance – How Much is Enough?\nTerm v Permanent Life Insurance\nWhole Life v Universal Life Insurance\nDo I Have to Buy an Annuity?\nCase Study: Permanent Insurance and a Down Payment\nDo I Need Property Insurance?\nUp Next\nRetirement Ready – Do I Need Long-Term Care Insurance?\nThe content contained in this blog post is intended for general informational purposes only and is not meant to constitute legal, tax, accounting or investment advice.

It is a protection to cover most people's most important asset which is their ability to earn a living. If you work for an income and it is a must, then long term disability is a must as well.

Yes, using a broad definition of investment. Having a good Long Term Disability Policy protects your investments and assets from liquidation by providing an income stream ( you can and should have an inflation rider) to help you maintain or prolong a lifestyle.  Technically, insurance is insurance, but you can consider it to be an investment in your asset protection.\nAnswered on December 15, 2014\n+0\n+1 this answer\nflag this answer\nview more answers by Larry Gilmore\n37376 POINTS\nContact Me\nview profile\nDavid G. Pipes, CLU®, RICP® PRO\nBusiness Development Officer, T.D. McNeil Insurance Services, Fresno, California\nBecause long term disability insurance provides protection for a certain period of time it hasn’t any cash value and could not be considered an investment.  Long term disability insurance protects what is most people’s most important asset, their ability to work.  If people depend upon your ability to work, a disability policy must be considered.  It is much more likely that you will experience a long term disability than it is you will die before a given age.  Disability is living death in that there isn’t any income and yet you remain as a consumer.  It is extremely popular coverage among professionals.\nAnswered on February 25, 2015\n+0\n+1 this answer\nflag this answer\nview more answers by David G.

Disability insurance  does not fit that definition and does not fit into any of those categories.\nHowever, informally, people often use this phrase as a way of asking: \"Which is a better way of spending my money? This or that?\" I imagine you are looking at your paycheck and wondering what is the most responsible way to spend it, considering all the things that could happen in the future.\nWell, based on that, Disability Insurance is a usually a good investment, because the chances of you becoming disabled are much higher than you dying, or going to a nursing home, or many of the other types of insurance out there. Also, losing one's paycheck has a great impact on most families. If your paycheck is not crucial to your family, getting life insurance or other types of insurance may be a better investment.\nAnswered on June 4, 2015\n+0\n+1 this answer\nflag this answer\nview more answers by Peggy Mace\nDid you find these answers helpful?\nYes\nNo\nAdd Your Answer To This Question\nYou must be logged in to add your answer.\n<< Previous Question\nQuestions Home\nNext Question >>\nThis Week's Top Agents\nAll Time Top Agents\nPeggy Mace\nDavid Osgood", "The Pros & Cons of Disability Insurance, Explained | Breeze\nHome\nDisability Insurance Quotes\nPros & Cons of Disability Insurance\nThe pros & cons of disability insurance, explained\nJoel Palmer\nLast Updated March 29, 2022\nRead Time\n6 mins\nReviewed by\nJack Wolstenholm\nIn This Article\nGet an instant disability insurance quote!\nGet Quote\nTrying to decide whether disability insurance is a good idea for you? It helps to break down the pros and cons. We've got you covered.\nLike anything, disability income insurance has its pros and cons.\nYes, there are a number of reasons why it makes good financial sense to buy a disability insurance policy. But there are also plenty of excuses for not wanting to get this type of coverage. (Some valid, others not so much.)\nLet's take a closer look to help you better understand how this type of coverage fits into your financial plan.\nDisability insurance pros\nDisability insurance cons\nPros of disability insurance\nDisability insurance protects your greatest asset\nYou probably have insurance to protect your other assets from loss. Your home. Your car. Your boat or RV. Pricey possessions like jewelry. Some people even have insurance on their pets so they don’t have to choose between the family dog and a costly vet bill.\nBut none of these is your greatest asset. And ironically, it’s this asset that so many people neglect to insure.\nNo matter your income level, your greatest asset is the ability to earn a living.\nYou may not think of your income as an asset, but you should. It makes all the aforementioned possible. Lose your income, even temporarily, and you may potentially have to forfeit the assets you already have insured.\nThink of it this way. If you make $75,000 a year and never receive a raise again, your ability to earn an income is worth $375,000 over the next five years. That’s not including benefits that are part of your compensation.\nCurious what disability insurance costs? Check your rate here\nWhat's your gender?\nWhat's your birth date?\nDate of birth\nDo you use nicotine?\nWhat's your ZIP code?\nZip Code\nDisability insurance allows you to focus on recovery\nFew things hinder recovery more than anxiety about finances. Worrying about how to make up for lost income can actually prolong your illness or injury and make it more difficult to return to work at full strength.\nDisability insurance will help you replace your lost income as long as you meet the policy’s definition of disability. That means you won’t have to rush your recovery to return to work against the doctor’s orders.\nDisability insurance helps you continue meeting financial obligations\nMost of your debts will remain your responsibility if because of a disability you can’t work at all or have to work less.\nThis is especially true if you own the property that secures a loan, such as your house and car. If you want to continue living in your home and still owe on your mortgage, you must continue making payments or risk foreclosure. Your vehicle can be repossessed if you neglect payments.\nFor unsecured debt like credit card debt, you still are responsible for repayment. Something that does work in your favor is that many states protect private disability insurance benefits from being seized or garnished by creditors. And the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act protects a portion of your disability payments from collection.\nDisability insurance helps you avoid debt, bankruptcy, and other financial emergencies\nAbout 15 percent of bankruptcy filings are caused by an illness or injury to themselves or family members? According to the Council for Disability Awareness, another 20 percent are caused by a lost job and 26 are due to unpaid medical bills.\nWithout an emergency fund or other assets to fall back on, disabled individuals tend to rely on credit to get by. This usually includes credit cards, but people struggling with day-to-day expenses may also use short-term, high-interest loans.\nAlso, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank, about 1 of 18 mortgages is not being paid because of a disability to the mortgage holder. In addition, a disability to the mortgage holder is the leading cause of foreclosures, accounting for about 48 percent.\nA disability can quickly deplete whatever savings a person has accumulated. Only 40 percent of households have enough cash on hand to last three months or more without income.\nDisability insurance provides greater peace of mind\nAs much as you want to avoid the topic of disability, it’s important to consider how the possibilities would affect others, not just emotionally, but financially as well.\nAccording to the Social Security Administration, more than 25 percent of today’s 20-year-olds will miss at least a year of work because of a disabling condition at some point in their working career. Furthermore, about one in seven people between the ages of 35 and 65 can expect to become disabled for five years or longer.\nIt’s not just serious accidents that cause disabilities. In fact, only 10 percent of disabilities that cause missed work are due to accidents; the remaining 90 percent are due to illnesses like heart disease, cancer, or as of late, COVID-19.\nSome people neglect the need for disability insurance because they have a spouse with a successful career who they believe can live comfortably on their own.\nBut even if this is true, chances are your combined lifestyle is based on both of your incomes. If your’s is lost to disability, what will happen to your significant other? Can he or she afford the mortgage on your house on one income? If you are disabled, can your spouse continue paying your student loan debts that will still be owed?\nYou can minimize the negative financial impact of disability by investing in an individual disability insurance policy.\nProtect your income with disability insurance!\nApply Online\nCons of disability insurance\nDisability insurance can be expensive\nIn general, people spend between 1 percent and 4 percent of their income on a disability insurance policy. Another general rule of thumb is that you will typically pay between 2 percent and 6 percent of your policy’s monthly benefit amount.\nIt’s possible you may pay more or less than those ranges, especially if you are older, have chronic health conditions, or have a job that makes you more susceptible to a potential disability.\nLearn More: How Much Does Disability Insurance Cost Per Month?\nDisability insurance may require a medical exam\nMost individual disability insurance policies require the applicant to undergo a paramedical exam once the application is submitted. This is an important part of the underwriting process, as it provides the insurer an assessment of your health and therefore your potential of filing a claim. This could take several days or more, depending on your availability and when a technician is available.\nThis exam for disability insurance is much like a physical checkup. It should take about 30 minutes. It will consist of an interview to gather a medical history, as well as the collection of blood and urine and recording of height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse.\nDisability insurance makes you wait for benefits to kick in\nDisability insurance policies come with an elimination period. This is the period of time between when the disability occurs and when benefits are paid. For example, a policy with a 60-day waiting period would not pay benefits for the first 60 days after the insured becomes disabled.\nA disability insurance elimination period is a similar concept to the deductible on other types of insurance. It’s designed so that the insurance company does not have to pay 100 percent on a claim; the insured has to pay some of the cost out-of-pocket before benefits kick in.\nFor short-term disability insurance, in which the maximum time you can receive benefits is one year, the elimination period is typically 14 days.\nLong-term disability policies have longer elimination periods, as benefits may last several years. Common options include 30, 60, 90, 180, and 365 days.\nDisability insurance often involves a slow, confusing process\nMany disability insurance carriers require you to work with an agent to get coverage. Plus, most still use lengthy, cumbersome paper applications.\nFrom the time you submit an application for a disability insurance policy, it may take four to six weeks before your policy is issued. in some cases, it could take longer.\nIt can also take a considerable amount of time to research carriers and evaluate all of the moving parts involved with disability insurance.\nThe information and content provided herein is for educational purposes only, and should not be considered legal, tax, investment, or financial advice, recommendation, or endorsement.

You're paying off debt\nMillions of millennials and Gen Xers are buckling under debt, mostly from credit cards and student loans. If you're on the hook for big monthly payments, a sudden loss of income can affect your ability to make them in full and on-time.\nFactoring how much you pay toward debt balances every month into your coverage amount will ensure you don't fall behind if you get injured or sick, even if it's temporary.\n3. Your employer doesn't offer enough coverage, or any at all\nMost traditional employers offer short-term disability insurance, but that usually only replaces up to 60% of your income for about three to six months, plus you'll have to pay taxes on the payments.\nThese policies are obviously contingent on your employment with the company. If your injury or illness leads to job loss, you're out of luck.\nThat's why experts recommend long-term disability insurance for the most \"comprehensive and cost-effective\" coverage. Long-term disability insurance can effectively pick up where short-term coverage or your emergency fund leave off, typically between 90 days and a year after the incident (this is known as the elimination or waiting period).\n4. You work for yourself\nDisability insurance is crucial for self-employed workers, freelance writer Jackie Lam wrote for Insider. An insurance benefit can help provide consistent income and help cover ongoing business expenses.\nIf you're self-employed and shopping for disability insurance, you'll have to provide tax returns from the past two years as proof of income. You may also consider paying a higher premium each month to shorten your elimination period, or the time you have to wait to receive insurance payments, since you don't have short-term coverage from an employer to tide you over.\nTanza Loudenback\nTanza is a CFP® professional and former correspondent for Personal Finance Insider.

Employer group policies typically replace only 60% of an individual’s pre-disability salary, often leaving the employee in need of additional coverage.\nThe Basics – What Is Disability Insurance?\nDisability insurance, also known as DI or disability income insurance provides income replacement in the event that an insured becomes disabled.  Disability insurance includes a variety of different benefits to best meet the needs of sick or injured individuals. Most plans include paid sick leave, short-term disability benefits and long-term disability benefits. Research suggests that a disabling work-related accident occurs on average, once every second – a statistic that proves the worth of having a separate disability insurance plan.\n5 Reasons to Have Disability Insurance\nNo one enjoys paying more for anything than they already have to, especially when it comes to insurance. However, in regards to disability insurance, it really does make sense to take out a separate disability insurance plan. The following five reasons illustrate the importance and benefit of disability insurance:\n1. Incomplete employer coverage – While most employers provide disability insurance, the average plan only covers 60% of an employee’s salary and caps benefits between $5,000 and $10,000. These figures typically fall well below the 60% income mark and leave individuals in need of additional income. An additional individual disability plan will supplement employer coverage to provide the disability income level necessary by the insured.\n2. Unfortunately, the risk of disability is high – A 30 year-old man has a one in five chance of suffering a long-term disability in his lifetime while a woman of the same age has a one in three chance.\n3. Long-term disability coverage is crucial – Most employer plans only cover short-term disability, which means if an individual’s disability extends even one day beyond the benefit period, he or she will be responsible for all of the costs.\n4. An individually controlled elimination period is helpful – The elimination period is the time between the onset of disability and the beginning of payments. An employer plan determines this period while an individual plan allows the individual to establish this period.\n5. Lifetime benefits or retirement protection – An individual plan can be arranged to offer lifetime benefits or to supplement a retirement plan whereas most employer plans don’t offer this benefit.\nWhile most people do not wish to think about the possibility of suffering a disability or any other health issue for that matter, the reality is that can still happen. Purchasing disability insurance from Art Young Insurance, or other similar insurers, provides you the protection necessary if that reality becomes yours.", "What are the pros and cons of disability insurance?\nYOU A SK:\nWhat are the pros and cons of disability insurance?\nWE A NSWER:\nThe main question you have to ask would be\nwhether it makes sense for you to get disability insurance based on your\nspecific circumstances.

Without some type of income protection, more Americans are experiencing severe financial difficulty if they need to miss work due to illness, injury, or pregnancy. Disability insurance is more important than ever.\nMay is Disability Insurance Awareness Month. This is an opportunity for the insurance industry to raise awareness about the importance of income protection. So, let’s look at four key reasons to purchase disability insurance.\n#1 Reason to Purchase Disability Insurance: Social Security doesn’t cut it\nSocial Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is a program under which people earn coverage for benefits by working and paying Social Security taxes on their earnings. The program provides benefits to disabled workers but, the Social Security Act defines disability very strictly.\nIt defines a person as disabled when they can’t work due to a severe medical condition that has lasted, or is expected to last, at least one year or result in death. The medical condition must prevent you from doing work you did in the past, and it must prevent you from adjusting to other work. And Social Security doesn’t provide temporary or partial disability benefits.\nIf you meet the strict disability definition, Social Security disability payments are modest. At the beginning of 2019, Social Security paid an average monthly disability benefit of about $1,234 to all disabled workers. This was barely enough to keep a beneficiary above the 2018 poverty level.\nYour Social Security benefit statement shows a disability benefit you may receive if you become disabled, and we explain why you should get your latest statement in this blog post.\n#2 Reason to Purchase Disability Insurance: Your family relies on your income\nAs we’ve seen from the recent pandemic, life can change quickly. An illness or injury could take away your ability to earn a living. An income in the form of a steady paycheck is your most valuable asset and provides for you and your family.\nWithout disability insurance, 50% of Americans said they would use their savings to help them meet their expenses if they were unable to work due to illness or injury.* Protecting a paycheck with disability insurance can secure your family’s financial future.\n*The New American Milestones (2020), Life Happens\n#3 Reason to Purchase Disability Insurance: Most long-term disabilities are due to illness, not accidents.\nAccording to the Social Security Administration, 25% of today’s 20-year-olds will become disabled at some point in their career. That’s a pretty big risk to take. How long would you be able to meet your rent or mortgage, car payments, bills, and other monthly expenses if you couldn’t work?\nIt’s a common misperception that you only need disability insurance if you work in a dangerous profession. The truth is, illness, not accidents, accounts for most disabilities that keep people out of work. And if you thought your employer’s Workers’ Compensation coverage would protect you, think again. It only pays in cases where your illness or injury is related to your work. The vast majority of long-term disabilities are not job-related.\n#4 Reason to Purchase Disability Insurance: It’s not as expensive as you might think\nThe cost of disability insurance will depend on several factors including your benefit amount, benefit period, occupation, health status, age, and terms of the policy. As a general rule of thumb, however, the cost of an individual long-term disability insurance policy is about 1% to 3% of your annual salary. And it’s the most cost-effective form of income protection you can get.\nYou can minimize the cost you pay each month by applying young, living healthy, and carefully evaluating your coverage options. That’s why the best time to buy disability insurance is right now!\nIt’s time to act now to make sure your income is protected.

But if you were unable to work as a result of an accident or illness, how would you and your family pay the bills? Savings can evaporate fast and parents or siblings may not be able to help.\nThe answer could be to plan ahead by taking out disability insurance. It can provide a much-needed safety net by replacing up to 70 percent of income. Yet few Americans even consider such a policy. In fact, disability insurance typically takes a distant third place after life and auto insurance: seven in 10 workers don’t have any long-term disability coverage.\nThe chances that you'll need it, though, may be greater than you  realize. More than 25 percent of today’s 20-year-olds will become disabled before reaching age 67 according to the Social Security Administration. And 43 percent of all people age 40 will be sidelined for 90 days or more by age 65, according to data from the Insurance Information Institute.\nNot all people become disabled due to an accident. According to the Council on Disability Awareness, about 90 percent of disabilities result from an illness such as cancer and diabetes\nAs medical bills pile up, the expenses have become the leading cause of personal bankruptcy, with three out of five bankruptcies due to loss of significant income as a result of illness. Even scarier, three-quarters of those bankrupted by medical debt actually had health insurance —it just wasn’t enough to replace their paychecks.\nHave you considered getting disability insurance?\nTell us how you made your decision below.\nDon't Rely on Social Security Disability Insurance\nSocial Security Disability Insurance, or SSDI, or workers compensation might not provide a safety net. Consider these statistics from the Council for Disability Awareness:\nSome 65 percent of initial SSDI claim applications were denied in 2012.\nThe average monthly benefit paid by SSDI by the end of that year was $1,130 per month.\nBecause fewer than 5 percent of disabling accidents and illnesses are work-related, the other 95 percent are not covered by workers’ compensation.\nInsurance You Need\nTo prepare for an emergency, you should have enough in savings to get you through the initial three to six months without income. After you run through the emergency fund, long-term disability insurance can be a lifesaver—the average disability claim lasts more than 31 months. Disability insurance is available in two forms:\nShort-term disability insurance replaces a portion of your income during the initial weeks. Policies cover anywhere from a month up to a year of disability, providing income protection during the waiting period before long-term disability insurance kicks in. The major drawback: Short-term disability insurance is generally offered only through an employer.\nLong-term disability insurance pays benefits of up to 60 percent of your pretax salary from five years up to, ideally, age 67. Many larger employers provide long-term disability coverage, however only about one-third of workers have access to long-term disability insurance through their employer. Others may want to buy their own disability coverage. Furthermore, because employer-offered plans generally limit the benefit period, sometimes to as little as two years, you may wish to supplement your protection.\nThe reassuring news is that the sooner you purchase long-term disability insurance, the less it will cost. Extending the period before you start receiving benefits will also lower the price. Generally, expect to pay between 1 and 3 percent of your salary.\n420 SHARES\nTrusted Advice Delivered Straight To Your Inbox\nGet insights and tips from our experts on everyday decisions.\nCatherine Fredman\nI write about personal finance—for the past two years at Consumer Reports, where I specialize in unearthing scams and fraud.\nShow comments (0)commenting powered by Facebook", "Disability Insurance: How It Protects Your Income | Guardian\nDisability Insurance\nHelp protect a portion of your paycheck from unexpected illness and injury that keeps you from working.\nGet a quote\nWhat is disability insurance?\nWhat are the benefits of disability insurance?\nTypes of disability insurance\nHow much disability insurance do you need?\nDisability insurance cost\nWhere to buy disability insurance?\nWhat is disability insurance?\nDisability insurance provides partial income so you can pay your bills if you get too sick or injured to work.

Chances Of Becoming Disabled Are Greater Than Your Chances Of Not\nHome » Insurance » Disability\nWhy Disability Insurance? Chances Of Becoming Disabled Are Greater Than Your Chances Of Not\nBy Gary Stuart | Submitted On May 30, 2006\nIf you and your loved ones depend on your salary for support, then you probably need long term disability income insurance.\nThink about it: if you were to become disabled, even for a few months, how would you and your family manage? Who would pay your bills? Disabling illness or injury is one of the leading causes of bankruptcy in the United States.\nMost people do not realize that their chances of becoming disabled are greater than their chances of dying prematurely. Yet they are more likely to buy life insurance than disability insurance. For this reason, people in the insurance industry call disability \"the forgotten risk.' According to statistics from the Journal of the American Society of Chartered Life Underwriters, if you are age thirty to fifty-five, your chances of becoming disabled are two to three times greater than your chances of dying.\nIf you are thirty-five years old, you have a 50:50 chance of experiencing a disability lasting last three months or longer before you retire. One in seven workers will become disabled for more than five years before he or she reaches age 65.\nMany people mistakenly believe that the government or Worker's Compensation will pay them an income if they become disabled. Actually, more than 80% of the people who apply for Social Security disability benefits are rejected. Social Security does not pay benefits for partial or short-term disability. Your disability has to either last a year or be expected to last a year before you can collect Social Security. Worker's Compensation pays only if you were injured on the job and benefits are often limited to a few years.\nYour health insurance will cover your hospital, doctor and other medical bills, but you will still not have a salary. Long-term care insurance only covers bills from nursing homes or assisted care center. Disability insurance, however, does not pay bills. Instead the insurance company gives you money on a regular basis. It is designed to replace your salary so that you and your family will not experience financial hardship during any period when you are too sick or injured to work.\nWhat should you look for when you are buying long term disability insurance? First, the insurance company itself should have a top rating from Moody's, A.M. Best, and Standard and Poor. These agencies rate companies in terms of capitalization, growth, earnings and other indicators of financial stability.\nSecondly, you should make sure you understand the terms of your policy. Some policies require a waiting period before you start receiving benefits. For example, your policy may have a six-month waiting period before benefits are paid. In this case, your benefits would begin six months from the time of disability.\nThe waiting period is often called the elimination period. Choices usually range from 30 days to 720 days.\nLook for a waiver of premium provision. This means if you become disabled, you will not have to keep paying for your disability policy.\nWhat are the conditions for renewing the policy? If you're policy is not automatically renewable, the insurance company has the right to cancel it.\nPayment period options are another consideration. Some policies will only pay for a certain period of time, sometimes for only two years. Other policies last a lifetime. The most popular policies pay benefits until you reach retirement age, when you can begin to collect Social Security payments.\nMost policies have a residual disability clause. If you suffer a disability, very often you will return to work part-time at first. Or because you were off work for a while, it may take you time to build your business back to the level it was before you became disabled. Your insurance should provide income for both these scenarios.\nCheck over the policy for a recurrent disabilities benefit. A recurrent disability is one that happens after you recover from your original disability. Your insurance should waive a new waiting period and/or not require proof that the two disabilities were related.\nWhen you buy disability insurance, you buy it according to your income level. The more money you make, the larger the benefit of your policy. But you also have to figure that your income will rise as you get older. For this reason you want a future increase rider or automatic increase rider. These riders allow you to keep your policy but increase the amount of your benefits based on your increased earnings as you grow older.\nWhen you buy your insurance, certain factors will affect your price. You will pay less for the insurance if you decide to replace 50% of your income instead of 80%. You also pay less if you opt for a longer elimination period. The insurance company factors in your current health and may exclude preexisting conditions. Women and smokers may pay more for disability insurance because they make more claims than non-smoking males. If you are in a high-risk job, your policy may cost you more.\nDisability insurance policies can be confusing. It is always best to sit down with a professional insurance agent to discuss the terms of the policy together and to ask questions until you completely understand the details of the policy quotes being presented.\nLaunching his insurance career in 1985, Gary Stuart successfully built and cultivated an agency, which specialized in all aspects of group health, life, long term care, disability income insurance and more!

They believed that everything, from pebbles on the beach to animals, possessed a spirit.\nEach clan (extended family) traced its origins to a specific spirit, which became their totem (symbol or crest) .  The sea and land animals that lived on the Pacific Northwest Coast formed the basis of First Nation mythology.  Each clan had a story of how an ancestor had a special encounter with an animal or spirit.  Consequently, they gained the skill to hunt certain animals, or the rights to hunt in a specific place or wear a special mask, or use an animal as a crest or totem for their art.  Pictures of these spirits were carved on totem poles and masks and were sewn on robes.  Traditional color schemes and stylized shapes were used to paint these spirits which were usually animals.  Each spirit or animal had a story to go with it.\nBe sure ALL 10 pictures are returned to the Packet Carrier after your Presentation is finished.\nNorthwest Coast Native American Art\nThe Northwest Coast Native Americans legends and art forms go back at least 1,000 years.  The very simple DESIGN ELEMENTS used in the wonderful masks, totem poles, rattles, storage boxes, panels and other artistic objects were always used in a correct manner and specific rules had to be followed.  These design elements are still used in the same way today by Northwest Native Americans.  The design elements are based on specific types of SHAPES .  You can easily tell what the ABSTRACT (Expressionistic) animals are if you understand the rules concerning the shapes of the design elements and the colors that are used.\nFormline:A design system of the northwest Coast cultures in which thick and thin lines enclose the basic Ovoid and U-form elements and their variations.\nOvoid : Variations of an oval SHAPE (2-D) or FORM (3-D) used in the design system of Northwest Coast art\nU-form:Variations of a U-shaped element in the design system of the Northwest Coast art\nAnimals represented in NW Coast Native American art have body parts that are enclosed with thick and thinner black lines called FORMLINES .  Certain SHAPES and FORMS are used to show the different body parts of an animal.  One frequently used element is called an OVOID .  It is a variation of an oval and has a rounded top with a flat bottom.  The ovoid may be solid (colored in with black or a color) but is usually an open shape made with a black Formline contour.  The upper section of the Formline is usually thicker than the lower.  A large ovoid may be used to create the head of a creature or a human.  Ovoids can represent eye sockets or major joints of a body (knees or hips).  They can help form a wing, tail, fluke, or fin.  Small ovoids may contain faces or indicate eyes, ears, noses, or the blowhole of a whale.  Ovoids also serve to fill empty spaces of a design.\nSometimes an INNER OVOID or a FLOATING OVOID is included inside a larger ovoid Formline.  This ovoid may be small and solid (painted in with black), or a nearly solid element (including additional LINE and/or COLOR) representing an eyeball.  Floating ovoids may also be part of the design on a wing, an arm or a body.\nAnother frequently used element is the U-FORM .  It looks like the capital letter “U” and one leg may be longer than the other.  Large U-Forms often help shape the body of a bird or an animal.  U-Form can be seen as part of the Formline in ears and in the tail or flukes of a whale or fish.  Smaller U-Forms also serve to fill in open spaces and are often used to represent the small individual feathers of a bird’s body.\nMany times a SPLIT U-FORM is used in ears, feathers, tails and many other open spaces.  If the U-Form is rather wide, a pair of Split U’s might fill the space in better.\nFORMLINES are usually painted BLACK.  U-forms and ovoids are most often painted RED, with white highlights.  Individual form elements are placed closely together and often show the entire body of the animal.  Sometimes only the head is shown.\nThe designs are frequently SYMMETRICALLY BALANCED (a mirror image on each side if divided down the center of the design).\nDifferent colors are used to show the inside of an animal’s body, such as white, green, blue or yellow.  These shapes and colors are used over and over again in different ways, depending on the animal depicted in the family legends.  Stories that are told, sung and danced use these visual symbols that help the tribes and clans understand the ways of their ancient people and remember their cultural heritage.\nMajor Tribes of the Pacific

Tales\nThe Birth of Thunderbird\nToolux, the South Wind, always traveled north in the summertime.  Feeling tired and hungry after a long day, he stopped to rest on the bank of a river.  An old witch called Quoots-hoi lived in a stone house nearby.\nToolux said to her, “Give me some food, for I am very hungry.”\n“I have nothing ready,” said the witch.  “But here is a net.  If you go and catch a little whale and bring it to me, I will cook it for you.”\nToolux took the net, which was made from the roots of the hemlock tree and waded into the water.   He soon caught a little what and brought it back to the witch’s house to clean and get it ready for cooking.\nQuoots-hoi handed him a knife made from a sharp seashell and said, “Do not cut it across the back, but split it along the backbone.\nToolux was in such a hurry for his dinner that he paid no attention to what the witch said and cut the whale across the back.  The whale immediately changed into a huge bird and flew away into the mountains where she built a nest and laid her eggs.\nToolux and Quoots-hoi followed the bird and found the nest.  They destroyed all the eggs except one, which hatched before they could break it.  The chick that hatched from that egg was Thunderbird.\nThunderbird flew away to the top of another mountain that was covered with clouds so that no one could find him.  Ever since, he has lived in the mountains making the thunder and the lightning\nTribal Whale Trivia and Mythology\nMany legends and beliefs grew up around these great sea mammals. The Tsimshian (SIM -shee-an) saw whales as being members of four clans, and represented them differently in art design.  This concept may have come from them recognizing that there were various whale species.  The Eagle clan of the whales had a white stripe across the middle of the dorsal fin. The Wolf clan carried a long dorsal fin like a wolf’s tail. The Raven clan’s fin resembled a raven’s beak and the Gispawadwe’da (no translation) had a short fin with a hole in the center\nThe Mahkah (Muh- KAH ), who lived on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, and the Nootka actively hunted the gray whale.  They were the only people along the entire Northwest Coast who hunted whales.\nIt was believed that if a whale were injured but not killed in the hunt, it would return at some other time and capsize the whaler’s canoe.  A widespread belief was that a whale could capture a canoe and drag it and all those aboard down to the underwater village of the Whales.  Once there, the people would be transformed and become whales themselves.  The Haida (HIDE -ah) believed that whales appearing in front of a village were drowned persons returning to communicate with the people.  Both the Tlingit (KHLING -git) and Haida Nations believed that great chiefs might return to life in the form of killer whales.\nAll of the Northwest Coast Nations use Killer Whale as a crest.  Killer Whale can often be shown held in the claws of Thunderbird.  In Northwest Native American Art he has a long dorsal fin and short pectoral fins.  Killer Whale has a round, snouted head with a large mouth and many teeth.  Sometimes he is shown with no teeth.  The tail of the whale has SYMMETRICAL flukes (the same on each side).\nThe Tlingit story tells of ancestors visiting the undersea home of Killer Whale, where he gave them the right to use the killer whale as a sign of the tribe.  The tribe was then endowed with that animal’s characteristics and its image was used as a crest.  This right was passed on from generation to generation as a valuable possession, just like a house or a canoe.\nThe Haida have a legend of Raven-Finned Killer Whale, a Whale Chief who carries a raven perched on top of his tall dorsal fin.  There are legends of two, three and even five-finned killer whales.  These legends may have originated from the sight of a cluster of dorsal fins where a pod of whales surfaced together.\nNatsilane and the Killer Whale\nNatsilane was a master carver and the best spear-maker of the Grizzly Bear tribe.  He tried hard to please his wife’s family—on sea lion hunts, he was always the first to leap out onto the rocks to make a kill.  By the time his brothers-in-law arrived, all the other animals had escaped into the water.\nNatsilane’s reputation as a hunter made his brothers-in-law so jealous that they plotted to get rid of him.  Next time they went out on a hunt, the brothers paddled the canoe away and abandoned him on a rock.  Only the youngest brother cried out for them to go back.\nNatsilane tried to spear a sea lion to eat, but the spearhead broke off inside the animal and it swam away.  However, the sea lions took him to their den, where he saved the sea lion chief’s son by removing his own broken spearhead from the animal’s side.\nAs a token of his thanks, the sea lion chief sent Natsilane home in an inflated sealskin bladder.  Natsilane stopped at a beach near his village, chose a piece of spruce wood and set about carving a killer whale.  His first attempt wouldn’t float, so he tried with hemlock wood and then with red cedar.  Finally he carved a killer whale from yellow cedar, which leapt into the sea and swam.\nNatsilane told the whale to find his brothers-in-law and drown all but the youngest.  When this was done, he ordered the whale to do only good to humans in the future and so the killer whale became an omen of good luck.\nSome Frog Tales\nThe Haida(HIDE -ah) are said to have carved a frog on a house pole to prevent it from falling over.  It was also their belief that Raven ate frogs.\nFrog’s characteristics are a large mouth, usually with thick lips, and legs (with toed feet) posed in a flexed position.  The absence of teeth, ears and tail confirms frog’s identity.\nUntil they were introduced recently, there were no frogs inhabiting the Queen Charlotte Islands in Canada.  Here are two different legends that might explain why:\nNorth of the Queen Charlotte Islands, the Tlingit(KHLING -git) Chief’s daughter made fun of a frog and was later lured into the lake by a frog in human form.  The chief’s daughter then married the frog.  Unable to persuade the Frog People to let her return home, her father (the Chief) and her mother dug a ditch to drain the lake, which scattered the frogs in every direction.\nAnother tale explains that when the Frog Chief first encountered a black bear, he was terrified.  The huge bear tried to step on the hopping creature for fun but the frog escaped.  He returned to his village and told of the frightening experience.  Fearful that the bear would seek them out, the frogs decided to flee the islands.\nWolf Tales and Tradition\nWolves were believed to have strong supernatural powers, but their spirits were harmless to humans.  Revered because it was a good hunter, the wolf was often associated with the special spirit power a man had to acquire to become a successful hunter.  A wolf is sometimes shown with flippers instead of paws.  This is the mythical Sea Wolf, named Wasgo, from Haida (HIDE -ah) legends.\nBoth the Kwakwaka’wakw(Kwah-kwah- hooah -kwah) and Nuu’chah’nulth (Nou- char -nooth) Nations claimed wolves as ancestors and impersonated them in their ceremonies.  The Wolf Dance of the Nuu’chah’nulth —the Tlokwana —records the days when the wolves taught the people to live together in communities and gave them the organizations that were important in First Nation society.\nThe creation story of the Nuu’chah’nulth (Nou- char -nooth) tells how an ancestor visited the House of Wolves, where he was taught songs and dances.  He thought he had been away for four days, but when he went home he discovered that he had been gone four years.\nUsually the wolf is seen in profile (from the side) .  He may be crouched on all fours or sitting with his front paws raised.  The four main features that identify a wolf are long snout with flared nostrils, large and many teeth (which may include canines—those sharp front teeth), large ears and a curled-over tail.  The tail might even have a lot of diagonal curved lines to represent its bushiness.\nWhy the Wolves Dance— A traditional Tribal Drama\nThe Tlokwana, or Wolf Dance of the Nuu’chah’nulth(Nou- CHAR -nooth ), begins when men disguised as wolves kidnap a group of young children, wearing ceremonial costumes.  The kidnapping is symbolized by finding the children’s ordinary clothes torn to pieces on the beach.\nThe parents of the kidnapped children are accused of being careless:  “You should watch your children more carefully, then the wolves couldn’t steal them.”  As a punishment, the parents are pushed into the sea.\nMuch feasting and merry-making follows this event, because it’s forbidden for anyone to eat alone during the ceremony.\nIn the early hours of the morning, search parties go through the village looking for the children, tipping people out of bed and throwing cold water over them.  When the search proves fruitless, preparations are made to attract the wolves by ceremonial drumming.\nThe drum leader climbs onto the roof of the clan house to watch for supernatural signs that the drumming should begin.  Soon the sound of whistling wolves can be heard outside the house.  The drummers stop and the kidnapped children can be heard singing songs about how they have been captured by the wolves.  The children are then taken away again.\nNow the rescuers set out in canoes across the bay, armed with traps made of twigs and netting.  After several feigned attacks and a great deal of hilarious jostling, the children are “rescued” and returned to the village.  They perform the songs and dances that the wolves have taught them and their ceremonial costumes are burned.\nNative Americans felt that children were special and important.  They were supposed to be protected and cared for until they were grown.  Tribal children became full fledged adults as teenagers.\nDoes this story give you any clues about how important caring for children was to the NW Coast Native Americans? The dance probably helped the tribe’s children know that they were an important part of the village.  Everyone probably had some good laughs after sleeping grown-ups were tipped out of bed and splashed with cold water.  The dramatic “rescue” sounds like a lot of fun and good laughs for the entire village.  This tradition seems like a good excuse for adults to play games!\nCareless parents are pushed into the sea as punishment for not watching out for their children, after men in wolf costumes pretend to kidnap them. What message would this dance give to the tribe’s parents? That it was important to take good care of their children\nBear Mythology\nMarriages with animals, particularly bears, occur often in traditional NW Indian stories.  The bear was thought to have a close relationship with people because it behaves like a human and competes for the same food.  It can walk on its hind legs, fish for salmon and eat berries.  When chasing a bear, a hunter carried out a special ritual, because he was killing a creature whose soul was so much like his own.\nIn Native American art the bear is defined by having short, round ears, large flaring nostrils, a wide mouth with conspicuous teeth and often a protruding tongue (it sticks out).  Claw-like hands and feet are characteristic.  The small tail of the bear is usually ignored and not included in artwork.\nIn the Tsimshian (SIM -shee-an) village there is a tall totem pole carved with the figures of a mother bear and her cubs.  Its legend tells the following story.  Other clans had their own version of the bear myth but most of them followed this theme.\nThe Girl Who Married a Bear\nOne late afternoon, Peesunt, the daughter of the chief, was picking huckleberries in the woods.  Peesunt stepped in some droppings left by a bear.  “Ugh,” she cried in disgust, “what filthy, disgusting creatures bears are!”\nSoon afterward, a handsome young man wearing a thick bearskin cloak came walking toward her through the woods.  “Come,” he said,  “give me that heavy basket.  It is much too late for you to return home now.  My village is not far from here.  You can stay there tonight.”\nHe led Peesunt to his village, where a number of people were seated around a fire, all wrapped in bearskin robes.  An old woman at the center of the group said, “Your insulting words have angered the Bear chief.  He sent his son to bring you back and now you are to become his wife.”\nSo Peesunt had to marry the chief’s son and soon she gave birth to twin children who had human form in their own home, but changed into bears whenever they went out.\nBack in Peesunt’s village her family was grief-stricken at her disappearance and her brothers searched for several years to find her.  They hunted many bears all over the country until, at last, they found the cave where Peesunt was imprisoned and killed her husband.\nPeesunt went home and was greeted with much rejoicing.  Her children, though remaining human from then on, were able to kill bears with ease, because they were related.\nSun and Star Mythology\nNorthwest Coast Native Americans believed that the arrival of daylight transformed creatures into the physical forms they are today.  People who were wearing the skins of otters, beavers or seal, turned into those animals when Raven let the sun loose.  Those who were wearing nothing remained as human beings.  They selected their clan crests (or totems) in memory of their transformed animal companions who had once been humans.  Here is the traditional story of how daylight came to the world:\nHow Raven Stole Daylight\nWhen Raven was born, the world was still in darkness.  Far up the Nass River lived a selfish chief who kept the light just for himself.\nRaven thought of many plans for getting light into the world.  Finally he changed himself into a hemlock needle, which then fell into some water that the chief’s daughter was about to drink.  The girl swallowed the needle and raven was inside her.  Raven was then born to the chief’s daughter in the form of a baby.\nWhen her baby was born (who was actually Raven), he gazed around with bright eyes.  He pointed to some bundles hanging on the wall and cried for several days until finally his grandfather said, “Give my grandchild what he is crying for.  Give him that one hanging on the end.  That is the box of stars.”\nThe child that was Raven played with the box, rolling it around on the floor.  Suddenly he threw it up through the smoke-hole.  The box flew up into the sky and the stars fell out, arranging themselves as they are today.\nSometime later he began crying again.  Then his grandfather said, “Untie the next bundle and give it to him.”\nAs before, Raven rolled the box around on the floor and after a while he threw it up through the smoke-hole—and there was the big, silvery, full moon for all to see.\nNow there was just one bundle hanging on the wall and so Raven cried for that.  As soon as he had the box in his hands he uttered a raven cry, “Caw, caw,” and flew out through the smoke-hole.\nRaven tried to exchange the sun box for food, but he was only mocked for his efforts.  So he opened the lid of the box anyway, and the sun burst out and rose into the sky.\nThe Potlatch\nPotlatches are held to mark many important occasions in the native tribal cultures of the Northwest.  These can include the naming of a child, the coming of age of a chief’s daughter, a marriage, the raising of a totem pole, a memorial ceremony for a dead chief or the taking of an additional name by a chief, giving him more prestige.  The important part is that the occasion happens before witnesses and is accompanied by feasting and the giving of gifts.  A chief, who is generous providing lavish gifts and hospitality, is highly thought of by his clan and by neighboring villages.  Potlatches were an important institution on the Northwest Coast in ancient times and thousands of dollars in goods, including blankets, food and ornaments, could be distributed by a tribal leader to rival clans.  The challenge to the other clans was to match or top this show of generosity.  The Potlatch is still important to modern Northwest Native Americans.\nPotlatches have a set plan of events.  A modern Potlatch lasts 12 to 14 hours.  In the past they could go on for days and days.\nA Potlatch always starts with a mourning session.  The Potlatch giver asks women to come before the assembled chiefs and pay tribute to those who have died recently and their departed ancestors.\nIf a copper is to be sold or transferred, this is done next.  This is a very solemn event.  Coppers are large plaques of copper metal sculpted with designs of a clan’s crest.  Coppers are used as an indication of wealth—they generally are valued at the same cost as the number of blankets given away at the Potlatch.  To throw only one copper down in front of a chief was a great insult.\nIf a marriage ceremony is to be performed, this happened next.  Then the great feast, including the tseka ceremony, when cedar bark headdresses are distributed to the chiefs.  Feast songs are sung, and ceremonial dances are performed.  After the feast, guests join in am’lala or “fun dances” .  Lastly, gifts and money are given to the guests in order of their social rank.\nIn 1884, the Canadian Parliament outlawed the Potlatch, in a move to discourage the continuation of Native culture.  In the opinion of the Canadian government and church officials, Indians engaged in “heathenistic” dances and cannibalism.  Although there was a “Cannibal” dance done at some Potlatches, it was only part of a pretend dramatization.  No Native Americans actually participated in any real cannibalism.\nFor the first few years, the law was not enforced because there wasn’t enough money to send Indian Agents to investigate possible violations.  In the 1920’s, government officials began cracking down on Potlatching and there were many arrests throughout the following 30 years.  During the years the Potlatch was outlawed, many Northwest Indian cultures lost much of their traditional heritage.  Traditions were passed to younger generations through observation and participation in the annual ceremonies, songs and dances of the Potlatch.  Masks were carved for ceremonies of the Potlatch, and since the Potlatch was banned, there was no reason to carve masks or to teach the younger generations how to carve them.  Because of this, when the old people died there were few left to carry on the stories, dances, songs and traditional arts, since the traditional place for their use had been the Potlatch.\nMany Potlatch ceremonies still occurred during the 1920’s and 1930’s, although they were changed.  The Potlatch had originally lasted for several days.  After the potlatch was outlawed and Potlatch celebrations had to be secret, they began to last only 12-14 hours.  The tribes that continued to carry on the Potlatch in secret were able to pass the traditions, stories, artwork and dances down to the younger generations and their traditional culture was not lost.  Many tribes lost their cultural heritage because they followed the new government’s law and did not hold traditional Potlatches.  When the older members of these tribes died, the tribal traditions died with them.\nDuring the 1940’s, much Northwest Native American heritage was maintained and encouraged through illegal Potlatches but, as young Indian men went to serve in World War II, a significant change began.  These soldiers returned with a transformed perspective on life.  Many of them began to move away from their villages to work somewhere else.  Many left to join the civilization that had grown up around their ancient villages.  The ancient traditions were being left behind and forgotten by this younger generation.  The potlatch law was amended in 1951.  Tribes were no longer forced to hide this traditional event.  Many Northwest tribes still celebrate the Potlatch traditions today.\nThunderbird Mask\n11” x 30”\nDwayne Simeon\n1997\nAbout the Artist\nThe modern artist who created this mask is a Kwakiutl (KWAH -i-tl) Indian.  He was born in 1960 and now lives in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Dwayne says, “Listening to our elders stories about our old culture and our history of devastation, I realized how rich our culture was and all that we have lost.  I awakened to my responsibilities and to the need to revive our art and our culture.  Being an artist is what I was meant to do, to keep our art, our stories and our culture alive.”\nAbout the Art\nIn the legends of the First Nations of the Pacific Northwest Coast, thunder and lightning have great symbolic significance.  Several stories tell of a giant mythical Thunderbird with supernatural strength that inhabited the mountain peaks.  When this large creature flapped its huge wings, there was a terrific roar of thunder and lightening shot out from its piercing eyes and beak.  Whenever storms came up, people were reminded of the power of Thunderbird.\nEach different tribal group had its own legend about Thunderbird.  The Kwakwaka’wakw (Kwa-kwa- HOOAH -kwa) Nation tells how Thunderbird helped another ancestral spirit to build a large house.  Thunderbird then transformed himself into a human and so became the founder of that family.\nWhen Thunderbird was hungry he ate whales.  Thunderbird grasped the two Lightning Snakes that lived under his wings and threw them down onto a surfacing whale.  The snakes, striking with their lightning tongues, killed the whale.  Then Thunderbird swooped down, picked up the whale in his mighty talons, and flew with it to the far mountains to eat.\nThunderbird appears mainly on Kwakwaka’wakw and Nuu’chah’nulth (Nou- CHAR -nooth) totem poles.  The bird is usually depicted with outstretched wings.  The Thunderbird has curled horns on its head.  The horns are a way to identify the designs of Thunderbird and Raven because the two birds sometimes appear very similar.\nThe mask was carved from cedar, with shredded cedar bark added to the top and back of the head, and under the chin.  If you look closely at the eye you can see the wood grain.  The bottom half of the beak opens and closes.  The mask is 11” tall and almost 30” wide.\nSuggested Dialogue\nDo you think this mask would be heavy to wear?\nCan you point out any U-FORMS or OVOIDS on the mask?\nProject Ideas\nMake Thunderbird masks by attaching a construction paper beak to the bottom of a paper plate. Notice how the tip of Thunderbird’s beak is curved.  Fold yellow construction paper in half the long direction.  The fold will be the top of the beak.  Draw the curve at one side of the fold and cut from the other side, like the wide part of a triangle.  The tip of what would be the triangle is now the curved beak.  It won’t have a fold.  Fold the opposite edge of the beak horizontally about ½ “ and cut 6 slits across this area.  This will form tabs.  Attack beak to plate at the tabs so it becomes three-dimensional.  Tape or glue curve of beak together at top and front.  Use red, black and white construction paper to cut eyes, Ovoids and U-Forms.  Glue on mask to decorate. Attach string or elastic to the sides of the plate so the mask will hang on the wall or for kids to wear.\nCreate a paper mâche Thunderbird mask and paint with tempera paint.  This is a larger project that will require one or two more construction times to finish.  Some volunteers traditionally do one big project each year.\nHamatsa Crooked Beak Mask\nArtist Willie Seaweed (Kwakiutl Tribe)\nCirca 1940’s\nAbout the Artist\nWillie Seaweed was born in 1873 and died in 1967.  His generation was the last to have firsthand experience with the old ways.  When Seaweed was a boy, the Kwakiutl families were living in communal houses.  Some in his village could remember wearing woven cedar bark and for clothing and blankets and most travel was by canoe.  When Willie died, many villages had electricity, families lived in single dwelling frame house, wore clothing much the same as we do today and their transportation was mainly by powerboat or seaplane.  His life spanned the decades that had brought his people from their traditional village life to one aware of space exploration, television, ready-made clothing, Christian religion, the Canadian government and alcohol.  Each of these had a profound effect on the Indian cultures all along the Northwest coast.\nMany of the Indians of Seaweed’s parent’s generation saw more changes in their lifetime than in the 70 years before their parents were born.  In 1849, a Royal Charter declared Vancouver Island (Willie’s home) open for settlement.  Within 3 years, more than 400 white settlers were given land, former Indian land, by the crown to cultivate and “civilize”.  Then gold was discovered on the Island and literally thousands of miners came to the area every month.  With the settlers and miners came measles, small pox and tuberculosis.  These were deadly diseases for Indian communities, who had no natural immunities to these diseases.  Well over one-third of Native American populations were killed in some areas of Vancouver Island.\nSome Northwest Indians were also captivated by gold fever.  It made them neglect their summer food gathering and the annual salmon run.  In the winter of 1858, many Indians starved to death and many more moved to the towns to search for work so they could buy food.  When in close contact with the white culture, many Indians fell prey to the vice of liquor.  Missionaries also moved into the area during this time and their Christian standards of civilization tried to alter their native cultural heritage.  Willie Seaweed’s family was protected from most of these negative influences because their village was extremely isolated.\nBy the 1870s, the time immediate following Willie’s birth, the Indian population of Vancouver Island was assigned to reservations.  Indians had no vote, no representative in Parliament and no rights under the Canadian Constitution, which had declared them unequal because of their race.  Many children of Willie Seaweed’s generation attended missionary boarding schools, where they learned to read, write, speak English and adopt European religion and customs.  However, Seaweed’s family was very traditional.  Willy was raised speaking only Kwakwala (the native Kwakiutl language) and was taught only the traditional skills needed by a Kwakiutl (KWAH -i-tl) man.\nDuring his life, Willie Seaweed worked as a fisherman and an artist.  Most artists didn’t support themselves solely from their artwork.  People from the neighboring Kwakiutl villages and his own village would commission him to make masks, totem poles and other ceremonial objects.\nAlthough Willie’s father had been a recognized carver, he died before his son’s birth.  During traditional times there was said to be only one official carver for a village.  To become a carver, a person had to be from a prestigious, high-ranking family.  It was a common tradition, also, for the son to continue in his father’s place.  Both of Willie’s parents were of royal lineage and he became one of the highest-ranking individuals of this tribal division, the Nakwaktowk .  It’s thought that Willie’s artwork developed through an association with his half-brother.  Their early masks are quite similar to others created before the turn of the 20 th century.  The FORMS were simple, quiet and finished in native paints.  These colors were obtained from ochre clay (which produced golden yellow or red tones), lime or ground shells (each made white ), copper ore (blue/green) and graphite (black).  These native paint colors weren’t shiny or bright but they did have a rich depth.  About 1920, Seaweed adopted the newly imported “enamel paints” and with this change began to dramatically alter the appearance of his masks.  Enamel paints were available in a wide variety of COLORS—bright shiny reds, oranges, yellow, blues, greens, pure white and black.  His masks took on a more showy appearance once enamel paints were used.\nAbout the Art\nThis mask represents a cannibal bird known as the Crooked Beak monster, which appears as part of the cannibal dance, the most powerful supernatural masquerade of the Kwakiutl.\nAccording to myth, the Crooked Beak is one of four monstrous beings who live at the north end of the world and crave human flesh.  During the winter season, they come south to the Kwakiutl villages to capture young men of noble families and transform them into cannibals.\nThe cannibal dance is performed over a period of several days when guests from other villages have assembled for a Potlatch.  The Chiefly host stages a reenactment of the myth, with his own son portraying the victim, and fellow clansmen impersonating the dreaded cannibal monsters by wearing frightful masks such as this.\nLate in the first evening, after everyone has been assembled and fed in the host’s house, the guests hear strange and eerie whistles, announcing the approach of the cannibal monsters.  Suddenly, the chief’s son vanishes, having been kidnapped by the cannibals.  In reality, special dance assistants have taken him to the forest where they tell him how to perform the last act of the drama.  The last evening of the Potlatch, when the Chief’s son returns to the village, he behaves as if he has become a cannibal himself and he must be restrained from attacking others.  He appears to be biting the attendants holding him. The elder men of the village must cure the young man of his cannibal desires.  After dancing to cannibal songs, the chief’s son is cured of cannibal influence through ritual acts of the elders.  Four cannibal monsters, all monstrous birds with enormous beaks impersonated by men in masks, then emerge from the back of the house and dance around the central fire pit.  The Crooked Beak dancers wear the mask tilted upward, stopping occasionally while dancing to hungrily snap the beak.\nThe Crooked Beak monster is supposed to have a broad, gaping mouth, large red nostrils and a hooked crest above the upper jaw. The graceful spiraling SHAPES above and below the jaws in this picture are unique Willie Seaweed inventions. Seaweed’s exaggerated style of carving shows his creativity and skill, at their best in this picture.  The colorful, exciting and dynamic representation of this monster is experienced during the dramatic acting of the danced performance. As a piece of sculpture (it isn’t moving or being worn in this picture) this mask is still exciting, dynamic and dramatic.\nWillie Seaweed adopted the use of some non-traditional tools—the straight edge and the compass.  Although the Kwakiutl had long made use of stencils to regulate design forms, the addition of the compass and straight edge really gave the art a strong sense of SYMMETTRICAL BALANCE and composition.  Seaweed carried this development even further by refining his carving technique so there were no unexpected bumps or bulges.  What was meant to be straight was exactly straight and his curves were precisely and gracefully arched.  He used the compass to lay out the three concentric circles (circles inside of circles, getting gradually smaller) which formed the eye on his masks.  His artwork can be identified by a row of three compass point holes on the eye.  This is seen as a kind of Seaweed signature.\nSuggested Dialogue\nCedar bark was one of the materials used to decorate this mask.\nCan you guess where the artist used the cedar bark?\nThe mask was made from carved wood, cedar bark and paint. Northwest native artists used the soft, yellowish fiber beneath the rough outer cedar bark to make a type of yarn or thread.  To keep from killing the tree, only a small portion of the bark was removed at a time.  The yellowish fiber was then dried, shredded and twisted into a type of yarn that could be woven.  Capes, skirts, blankets and hats were created by weaving this fiber.  Cedar bark fiber repelled rain so it made good protective clothing for the Northwest’s often rainy climate. This dried fiber was also used as fringe to decorate things—such as the Crooked Beak  mask seen here. Cedar bark can be seen on the top of the mask and hanging beneath, as if the cannibal bird had hair.  Feathers are also attached to the mask  .Woven Cedar Bark hats were additionally covered with grease on the outside, for protection from heavy rain.\nFROG CAPE\nDempsey Bob, Linda Bob, Virginia Bob\nAbout the Artists\nThe design of this cape was created by a modern day Tlingit (Khling -git) Indian named Dempsey Bob.  He was born in 1948 in Telegraph Creek, B.C. (British Columbia).  About his art Dempsey says:  “I am inspired by the land, our people and our heritage.  I inherited a vibrant artistic tradition and have earned the right to be an artist from my people.  This land talks to me and I am creative here.  I strive to make my art real today, with feelings and power, to show that we have a living culture and art.  I want the art to speak to the people today.  I continually learn about my culture and myself which helps me in my ongoing quest to develop my artistic style.”\nLinda Bob and Virginia Bob sewed the cape.  They were also born in Telegraph Creek but now reside in Prince Rupert, British Columbia.  Linda stated, “I began making regalia to help keep our traditions alive for my family.  Most of the regalia I create is for my family and is worn for our feasts.  My grandmother inspired my work with her stories about our people gathering on the shore, dressed in full regalia to greet our visitors.” Virginia said, “When I work on our regalia I am inspired by our ancestors and their stories.  My mother and my grandparents told us many stories to pass down our oral tradition and keep our culture alive.  I create regalia for our family to express our culture and who we are.”\nAbout the Art\nThis frog cape is a version of a button blanket.  The cape is created with red and black wool.  The frog crest is a symbol of the family’s clan.  The frogs have been created with red wool and sewn to the black wool.  The top red band of the cape has the frontal view of a frog in the center.  On the top left side of the cape is a frog head that has been carved from alder wood.  The cape is fringed with leather.  Above the fringe, in the center of the frog’s eyes, on the backs of the frogs and on the top band you can see white buttons.  These button blankets or button capes have white mother of pearl buttons.  These capes are worn with masks (regalia) by the campfire to tell stories.  The mother of pearl buttons catch the glimmer of the firelight.  Today the button blankets or capes are still created for families to wear at family feasts and celebrations.\nSuggested Dialogue\nCAN YOU FIND ANY OVOID SHAPES? Center eyes for large center frog and frog face along top band, hips of the frogs (or fanny), nose of top band frog face\nSPLIT-U SHAPES? Thighs and top shoulders of large center frog\nIs there any REPETITION in the cape decoration? There are two smaller frogs that are the same, the round buttons are repeated\nIs there any PATTERN? The buttons are sewn on in several REPEATED patterns\nProject Idea\nHave kids sew a miniature button cape or blanket using two squares of felt.  The bottom piece can be black, navy or dark green.  The crest or totem should be cut from red.  Small white buttons could be sewn on for eyes. If you have enough buttons, sew on a few more.  Fake buttons could be made with a hole punch and a plastic milk jug.  Buttons will stay best if they are sewn. Remind kids to be careful.  Tacky glue works best gluing felt to felt.\nA button blanket could also be made with paper.  The buttons could be cut from white paper and hole punched.  Several sizes of white buttons are used on real blankets.  A crest or totem shape can be entirely created with buttons used in an outline of the animal shape.\nSun Mask\nKevin Daniel Cranmer\n1999\nAbout the Artist\nThis modern artist, Kevin Daniel Cranmer, is from the Kwakiutl (pronounced KWAH -i-tl) tribe.  He was born in Alert Bay, British Columbia and now lives in Victoria. Kevin explained his feelings about carrying on the tradition of ancient Native American artist ancestors when he said, “I started carving at the age of 12.  I was inspired by my father . . . [and] encouraged by my mother . . . The greatest satisfaction I have as an artist is creating pieces for my family and seeing them danced with in our ceremonies.  When I have the honor of dancing and showing a mask, I feel I embody who we are as a people and where we come from.”\nAbout the Art\nThe Kwakiutl and Tsimshian (Sim -shee-an) people saw the sky as a beautiful open country where the house of the Sun chief was located.  By climbing up a chain of arrows, the traveler could reach it through a hole in the western horizon and could then return to earth by sliding back down on the long rays of the sun.  A family’s right to the t’lisala (sun) crest would be explained by their origin myth that would involve an ancestor of the family and the Sun chief.\nA face in the center of the sun design, surrounded by rays that may be simple or elaborate, makes this symbol an easy one to recognize.  The sun is a popular design of the Kwagiutl, and a large one stands atop the tallest totem pole in the world, at Alert Bay.  Kwagiutl sun designs tend to be dramatic, with lengthy and highly decorative rays.\nThis mask is carved from Red cedar.  The center face is the Sun chief.  The design on the circle around this face is Raven.  The circle is outlined with red rope.  The eyes of the center face are inlaid with abalone shell.  The abalone shell is also used in the center of Raven’s face, in the center of Raven’s split U-form mouth, on the cheeks and forehead of the Sun chief, on the mouth of the face on Raven’s tail.  The abalone shell eyes of the Sun chief are outlined with brass.  The other shiny Ovoid shapes in the center and on the rays are also brass.  This design is painted using black, white, red and blue.  In Northwest Native American artwork, blue isn’t used as often as the other colors are.\nSuggested Dialogue\nHow many ovoids can you find that are made of brass?\nCan you find ALL the Split U-Forms on the rays of this Sun Mask? The black tip of the ray is a split U-form, then a brass ovoid, a blue U-form, a black split U-form, a red U-form and 3 more U-forms underneath the red one.  (There are 14 split U-forms on all the rays combined—2 on each ray)\nWhich two types of BALANCE does this mask have? Radial and Symmetrical (formal) BALANCE\nCan you find the seven places in this busy design where abalone shell was used as part of the decoration? Near the top in the center of the black point is a circle of shell, just below this, inside a red ovoid is a shell ovoid, shell circles in center of eyes, two shell ovoids on either side of nose, a LINE of shell is used as a mouth in the ovoid painted below the face (it is a second face)\nProject Idea\nCut ovoid and U-Shapes from colored paper.  Glue to a background in a radial Sun mask design of your own.  (Ovoid and U-Form Pattern shapes are included in Project Patterns & Visuals, Packet 9.  See your Art Discovery Coordinator.)\nSun Mask (two)\nUnknown Artist Bella Coola tribe—Central British Columbia\nCarved wood and paint\n19 th century\nThe Bella Coola are a Salish-speaking people who once lived in 45 villages located in Canada, along the Bella Coola, Deans and Kimsquit rivers that lead to the Pacific Ocean.  It is a rugged and heavily forested area.  Once Europeans came to this area, the Bella Coola were struck with numerous deadly epidemics that killed many of their people.  Now, the remaining Bella Coola people live in one village, called Bella Coola, at the mouth of the Bella Coola River.\nLike their neighbors, the Kwakiutl, the Bella Coola staged elaborate masked rituals during the winter months, to accompany feasts and potlatches.  Many of the masquerades dramatized the story of Ahlquntam, the most important of the supernatural creatures recognized by the Bella Coola.  Ahlquntam was the creator of all men and animals, the master of fate and the leader of all supernatural beings.  He and his counselors decided who would be born among human beings, who would die, and who would be initiated to perform the ritual dances.  He was often impersonated at the performances.  A dancer wearing a large, humanlike mask would watch the dancers from behind the fire and occasionally pronounce in a powerful voice, “Mortals!  See me!  I am Ahlquntam!”\nAbout the Art\nThis mask represents the sun, which Ahlquntam used as his canoe and which he guided across the sky while wearing a cloak lined with salmon.  According to the myth, when Ahlquntam reversed his cloak, the rivers would run full of salmon.  During the ceremonies the mask was raised against the rear wall of the dance house and traveled across the ceiling to represent the journey of the sun across the sky.  This was done with strings and pulleys.\nTwo ravens, a killer whale and wings (beneath the face) painted on the sun disk frame the three-dimensional face in the center of this carved wooden mask.  The face represents Ahlquntam being borne across the sky in his spirit canoe of the sun.\nWho was Ahlquntam? The creator of all men and animals, the leader of all supernatural beings, he (and his counselors) decided who would be born and who would die, and who would grow up to perform the ritual dances at potlatches\nLook closely at the face.

I carve masks, poles, canoes and work in other mediums such as painting and appliqué (ap-li-kay).  My artwork, dancing, singing, canoeing and sweat lodges are sources of purification, learning and my spiritual path.”\nAbout the Art\nAs well as stealing the sun to bring daylight, Raven stole the moon, along with all the stars that he flung into the sky to lighten the darkness of night.\nWhen there was an eclipse of the moon, the Kwakiutl thought that a codfish, with its great gaping mouth, was trying to swallow the moon.  To prevent this from happening, a large bonfire was lit and green tree boughs were added, to create a lot of smoke.  As people danced ceremonially around the fire, thick smoke rose up into the sky, making the codfish cough and spit out the moon.\nThe moon is portrayed much like the sun, with a face filling the center but no rays extend from it.  Occasionally the moon may be shown in a crescent form.\nAmong the Haida, Moon was the exclusive crest of only a few of the highest-ranking chiefs.\nSuggested Dialogue\nThis mask is designed with Operculum shell.\nCan you find where the artist used the shell in this mask? For the teeth and spaced around the black outside ring\nBesides the shells, where else do you see examples of REPETITION in the mask? The smaller bright blue Split-U shapes around the outside circle, larger dark blue split-U shapes of outside ring, four ovoids (and floating ovoids) in outside ring, red lines in sets of three in outside ring\nWhat COLORS is the mask painted with? Red, white, bright blue, dark blue, black, white (eyes), the main part of the face (background) has been left natural so that the lines of the wood grain show through.\nAre there more WARM COLORS or COOL COLORS? Cool\nWhat type of MOOD does the mask create?  How does the mask make you feel?\nDo you think the shell teeth make the moon face seem more human or less human? (I kind of think the moon looks a little bit as if it he has “buck teeth”— what do you think?)\nDoes the natural wood color of the mask make the face seem more human or less human? Opinion will vary\nWolf House Posts\nUnknown Haida Artist\n19 th Century\nAbout the Art\nThe two wolves pictured here are about 7½ feet tall.  These “house posts” probably once stood at either end of the inside back wall of a traditional Haida house as symbols of the clan (a group of related families) that lived there.\nThe Haida inhabited several groups of small, forested islands, off the coast of British Columbia, in Canada.  They enjoyed plentiful natural resources and had traditions in common with the Tlingit and other Northwest Coast Native Americans.\nThe wooden posts were made for a house owner who was wealthy and who would have had the means to afford an expert wood carver.  The wood carver might need a year or more to complete the job.  When the posts were raised, there would be a great feast—the “potlatch”.  Visitors looking at the house posts would know that the families of the house belonged to the clan symbolized by the wolf.  The families had a strong connection to the wolf and to its qualities, like quickness and strength.  The Haida believed people were related to animal spirits and that at times they could change into their animal totems.\nSimilar to house posts, totem poles—very tall carvings of many animals and figures, one on top of another, that represented the history and story of a clan—often stood outside at the entrance to a house.\nSuggested Dialogue\nCan you find a U-Form on either of these wooden wolf posts? There are two individual wolf posts—one is shown from the side view and the other from the front.  The top form line of the ear on the side view and the forehead on the front view, the carved shape of the hands\nCan you find a Split U-form? Inside the ear and on the nose\nCan you tell that each post was once a single wooden log?  What helps you to know this?\nShow kids approximately how tall 7½ feet would be.  Can you imagine these big carved wolves looking at you?\nWhat would you think if you saw them?\nWhat would Haida visitors coming into the house in which they were placed think? The people who lived in the house were from the wolf clan and the wolf was their totem\nIf a friend came to your house, how would he or she know that it was your house?\nWhat things in it show that this is your house?  Is this the same in any way?\nProject Idea\nCreate a Wolf House Post with clay.\nA week beforehand, create plaster “logs” for kids to carve their Wolf House Posts.  Use paper towel tubes, blocked at one end with either waxed paper or aluminum foil held on with rubber bands.  In a large container, thoroughly mix 1 part Plaster of Paris and 1½ parts vermiculite (found in garden stores—fairly inexpensive).  Pour into tubes and set aside to harden for 5-7 days.  Peel cardboard tube from plaster.  Draw simple designs for the post on paper, then transfer the sketch to the block with pencil.  Don’t forget to use ovoid and u-form shapes in the design, to make it authentic.  Remind kids to KEEP THE DESIGN SIMPLE! Begin carving with the largest shape.  Use plastic knives, toothpicks, and metal spoons to carve.  When carving is complete, sand with medium sandpaper.  Wipe with a damp paper towel and paint.  The finished posts are lightweight.\nCrest Hat\nUnknown Tlingit Artist\n19 th Century\n14” high\nAbout the Artist\nAn unknown Tlingit (pronounced KHLING –git) artist created this hat sometime during the 1800’s.  Crest Hats were made for important feasts.  This Bear Crest hat belongs to a Bear clan in the Tlingit tribe.  A clan is a group of related families within the tribe.  It was a treasured possession to be worn by the various family heads and was thought of as a crown, symbolizing the spirit of the brown bear.  The brown bear, like the one on the hat, was an important animal to the Tlingit.\nThe mask is made from carved wood.  The center of the eyes and ears and the teeth are abalone shell.  The tongue is made of copper and it moves.  Abalone shell and copper were considered valuable to the Tlingit.\nThe hat was usually displayed at “potlatches,” feasts celebrating a birth, a special moment in the life of a family member or marking a death.  A potlatch included the giving of many valuable gifts and dancing, music and storytelling.  The number of rings on a crest hat is said to mean the number of potlatches at which the hat was worn.  This hat has eight rings.\nSuggested Dialogue\nThe artist added a realistic touch to this mask—fur.  Can you see the bear’s fur? Fur is glued into drilled holes along the edges of the ear. The fur is human hair.\nHow many potlatches has this hat been worn to? It has 8 rings—8 potlatches\nDo you wear hats?  What kinds of hats do you wear?\nDoes this look like a hat you’ve ever seen?\nWould you like to wear this hat?  Why or why not?\nHow would you feel wearing this hat?\nDo you think the artist tried to make the hat look like a real bear or an imaginary one?\nIn what ways did the artist make it look real or make-believe?\nHow many different colors do you see in this hat?\nHow big do you think it is? 14” high\nHow heavy do you think it would be?\nWhat is your favorite part of the hat?\nProject Idea\nCreate a clan hat using a tag board or poster board base.", "Art and aliveness on the Northwest Coast: Res: Anthropology and aesthetics: Vol 73-74\nFree\nArt and aliveness on the Northwest Coast\nMatthew Spellberg\nPDF\nIn the Native art of the Northwest Coast, figures are everywhere, and figures are very nearly everything. The artistic works from this great region of cultural ferment are engulfed by aliveness. Beings stack and swallow the entirety of a cedar house-pole, or spread decorously across a Chilkat blanket, or combine in chimerical merging wholes and halves on every side of a dancing rattle, or proliferate like vegetation up and down an argillite pipe. Even when a figure is found by itself, it tends to become what it surrounds; it dilates and disassembles until its body parts cover every contour of the bowl or hat on which it lives. The figure is on the object, but the object is fully in the figure.\nFrom one point of view, the observation that this is an art of figures, and especially animal figures, may appear banal. The representational art of the Northwest was traditionally the province of men, and men were hunters. 1 They were surrounded by animals, whom they studied, emulated, depended upon, competed with, made offerings to, and killed. These animals (ravens, bears, eagles, dogfish, salmon, killer whales, and also supernatural beings like the sea-wolf and sea-grizzly, or zoomorphic incarnations of the rainbow or moon) were the protagonists of their myths, and the crests in their all-important heraldic system. They made an art, like the art of many hunting peoples, in which these animals took center stage, sometimes interacting with humans, sometimes shifting in and out of a quasi-human form.\nAnd yet, though it’s easy enough to say in broad strokes why animal figures dominate this artistic tradition, it’s very difficult to say why they do it in exactly the way they do. How figuration functions in Northwest Coast art is the question at the heart of its charisma, and of its literal mysteriousness. This is an artistic tradition where individual beings are so elaborated and expanded that they often become impossible to identify. In becoming everything, they become no one thing.\nBill Holm puts the problem this way: “That even the most abstracted box or Chilkat blanket design is representative in a symbolic sense has long been known, and the principles of representation have been investigated and published. … The more highly abstracted the design becomes, that is, the more nearly the represented creature, by distortion and rearrangement of parts, fills the given space, the more difficult it becomes to interpret the symbolism accurately.” 2 In other words, the more prominent and all-encompassing the figure becomes, the more it obscures itself. This paradox is central to the nature of Northwest Coast art, and accounts for much of its tension and power. It is an art of exquisite stylization that never entirely gives up the goal of representation. Its ingenious formal system—widely known, thanks to Holm, as “formline”—enables a style that overwhelms content, yet always suggests there’s a content somewhere to be found. Design oscillates between abstraction and figuration, often replicating this movement at many levels within a given composition, such that one form seems at first a face, and then seems merely a joint, and then actually part of a body or tail, but really just an element within a symmetrical design—and on and on.\nScholars have usually understood this to be a technical problem. There was, they explain, a tension on the Northwest Coast between the conventions of realism and the conventions of ornament. Individual artists had to make decisions about how to situate their work between the two. “When the artist desires realistic truth he is quite able to attain it,” wrote Franz Boas, talking about the superbly naturalistic masks made for dancing. Then he goes on to say, “This is often not the case; generally the object of artistic work is decorative and the representation follows the principles developed in decorative art.” 3 Bill Holm, for his part, writes of the “degrees of realism” in Northwest Coast two-dimensional painting. He offers three categories: “configurative design,” where an animal is represented more or less with its actual silhouette; “expansive design,” where the animal is broken up to cover the whole space of an object, but the key body parts remain intact and recognizable; and finally “distributive design,” where a represented animal is broken up in such a way as to fill every part of a given space, and “the requirements of space filling have so distorted it that it is difficult or impossible to identify the abstracted animal or the exact symbolism of the parts.” 4\nThis line of formal analysis has produced worthy scholarship. Over the last half-century it’s become possible to identify individual styles, restore names of artists to the historical record, and make attributions for individual works of art. 5 But the technical structure and historical context of these artworks do not, I believe, give a final accounting for their energy and intellectual complexity. These also owe something to the philosophy that expresses itself through this art, particularly in those beings that explode like stars across the surfaces they inhabit, which are both foreground figure and background design, which are at once a representation on an object and the entire object itself. I believe this aesthetic is bound up with vital ontological and cosmological principles, principles also at work in many myths recorded on the Northwest Coast.\nThe distributive style that interests me here was most stylized and complete among the peoples of the northern Northwest Coast and was especially powerful in the two-dimensional flat-line painting used to decorate wooden (and sometimes woven) surfaces. Because of this (and because of my own limitations) this essay will mainly concern the work of Haida and Tlingit artists, as well as that of Haida and Tlingit storytellers. 6 Haida and Tlingit artistic traditions are very much alive in the present day, but here I will limit myself to art and story from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. At the same time, this essay could never have been written if friends and acquaintances on Haida Gwaii and on Lingít Aaní in southeast Alaska had not shown me something of what it’s like to live on their land and in the embrace of those traditions. These pages are, among other things, a modest response to that priceless education. (I hasten to add, however, that my friends bear no responsibility for any of the errors or eccentricities that follow.)\nTo talk about philosophy or deep meanings in Native art as an outsider is a delicate thing to do, and I wish to make clear that my speculations are here offered as the beginning of a conversation rather than its conclusion, as a possible template rather than a prescription, and with a keen sense for the limitations of a scholarly perspective. 7 But I nevertheless believe that talking about philosophy and deep meanings in Native art is urgent, for at least two reasons. First, and in general, it may help other outsiders appreciate the beauty, complexity, and spiritual charge of a Native art that is still often demeaned by various forms of condescension and prejudice. And second, in the specific case of this essay, it may contribute, however modestly, to the investigation of an essential aspect of our existence: how living beings encounter one another, and what systems arise to give such encounters value.\nIn my subject and approach I follow an unusual, tragic figure: the anthropologist and self-taught art historian Wilson Duff (1925–76). At the end of a lauded career working with Native peoples in the Northwest, Duff became fascinated—possessed—by what he perceived to be the hidden meanings in Haida art. He had come to believe that the art expressed its meanings primarily through style rather than content, and in paradox more than by precept. It was Duff’s contention that this paradoxical style transmitted nothing less than a cosmology—an articulation of the delicate equilibrium maintained by all beings in relation to one another, and of the proper forms of comportment that befitted individuals in possession of cosmic rank and prestige. Duff composed thousands of speculative, obsessive, ultimately mystical reflections, touched by structuralism, but making unexpected and intuitive use of its vocabulary. Before his ideas could be assembled into a book or other definitive form, he killed himself. Much of this late work—stored in the archives of the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia—has been contested or simply passed over in silence. 8 Yet the raw notes contain extraordinary flashes of mind, some of which might yet prepare the ground for a deep semiotics of Northwest Coast culture.\nDuff, I believe, was right to say that the aesthetic itself expresses a cosmology. 9 I wish to investigate one crucial aspect of this worldview, sometimes following in Duff’s footsteps, other times departing from his path. My main contention will be that the expansive and expanding figures who appear in Haida and Tlingit art reflect a distinctive theory about aliveness: namely, they understand aliveness to be the generator of all the material, perceptual, and metaphysical structures we call reality. The reality that so arises is predicated not on, say, Kantian concepts of space or time understood as a priori forms. Instead, the shivering intensity of sentience creates the very space in which it exists; a surface does not exist until a being moves over it. Furthermore, this aliveness is most generative right on the threshold of epiphany: the world is authored by the sudden flicker and flash of living beings behind dense screens of nonliving matter. At its most concrete, my claim is that a key model for both art and existence in this system of thought was the experience of the hunter waiting for a deer to jump from behind a bush, or of the spear fisherman waiting for his prey to breach the taut surface of the water. More generally I will suggest that Northwest Coast aesthetics are above all concerned with the moment when something crosses over from the deep realm of being onto the surface of human perception and wavers there: as yet unidentified and undescribed by the viewer, maybe an ally or an enemy, full of potential but uncontained by a designation. (Such emphasis on the potential will, I hope, also inhere in the presentation of my ideas: Duff believed that scholarship should not proffer definitive interpretations of indigenous art, but rather model a state of mind that makes it possible for the art’s meanings to emerge. This essay is an attempt to prepare for such emergence.)\nThe foregrounding of what I have come to call emergent aliveness may help to explain why northern Northwest Coast art is almost entirely an art of beings, essentially uninterested in landscape or visual narrative, at least as they are commonly rendered in many other cultures. 10 Moreover this complex, even ambivalent notion of aliveness presents important lessons about ecology, proprioception, and each individual’s obligations to the sentience that surrounds and sustains us—lessons that became particularly urgent in the era of colonial contact, and remain so now during its long aftermath.\nStasis in movement\nHaida and Tlingit art is often called “stately.” And indeed much of the work does appear on first glance static, monumental. Even when figures are depicted as part of a narrative (as on, say, a pole whose figures are meant to tell a myth) they don’t particularly move or interact, but sit in solemn poses, one on top of the other. A Chilkat blanket is the height of such abstraction, each figure and part of a figure evenly, geometrically laid out, the ensemble perfectly at rest.\nBut stateliness is locked in a powerful dialectic with its opposite. This is most obviously seen in objects (like the Chilkat blanket) meant to be moved with. Art in the Northwest was fundamentally (even though not exclusively) ceremonial. Its place was in the great dances and feasts of the winter season, when secret societies initiated new members and chiefs hosted potlatches for the confirmation of status. Such art depended on human sentience for its full effect, for it was meant to be brought out of its containers and worn, shaken, passed around. 11 Even house-poles and house-screens only gained their full meaning by the fact that a chief or other person of honor walked through them from one space to another.\nWooden rattles exemplify this peekaboo-play between stasis and motion. Used by chiefs and shamans, filled with pebbles, beads, or teeth, and typically shaped like a series of interlocking animals, they are meant to be shaken and whirled about while dancing so that their elegant forms come alive. Wilson Duff noted that they are usually made from parts flowing into wholes flowing into parts. 12 In the classic “raven rattle” form—as in an example from the Peabody Museum at Harvard—the rattle itself is in the shape of raven, whose head arcs out from the end opposite the handle (fig. 1 ). On the object’s belly, another face appears, showing a mouth with curved beak and humanoid eyes. This belongs to an underwater creature with many permutations: the old man of the sea, the supernatural snag, 13 or an essential and enigmatic being called in Tlingit G̱unakadeit —about whom I’ll soon have much more to say.\nFigure 1.\nWooden dance rattle (raven rattle), Haida or Tlingit, nineteenth century. 32.8 × 11.3 × 9.4 cm (12 15/16 × 4 7/16 × 3 11/16 in.). Exchange with the Smithsonian Institution, 1888. © President and Fellows of Harvard College, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, PM 88-51-10/50486.\nYet another bird head rises from the main bird’s back, and this bird head has a protruding tongue that is itself in congress with the tongue of a humanoid figure reclining just behind the main raven’s head. In this way, beings are stacked on beings stacked on beings, though the spatialization here is far more complex and self-aware than the crude cliché of the world resting on “turtles all the way down” (which, so far as I can tell, is a paradox imagined by Western writers and then projected onto other peoples). In the raven rattle, the bird is both the armature (Duff’s word) and the afterthought: its form creates the whole rattle, and yet, the other figures on the rattle take up all of its body until it is but a little head and some stubby wings. The rattle is an experiment in the interpenetration of perception and bodily existence: an investigation into how a face with its sensing organs might stand in for a whole body, and how a whole body might be eclipsed by a perceiving face.\nLying across the top of this form, to my eye much less imbricated in the chimera than its other members, is the human. Often known in the Haida myths as a “surface bird,” he is a rather inconvenient creature whose movements are restricted to two dimensions, across the top of the sea, and over the lowest parts of the land. In the Northwest, human limitations are everywhere announced by the shape of the world: impassible rainforest, mountains arrayed right up to the shore, a few narrow crescents of beach where villages can be built, and vast amounts of water—channels, passages, entrances, and the Pacific, stretching all the way to Japan. The creatures of the air and the creatures of the sea could move across their realms in all three dimensions (as could, in a way, the creatures of the forest, who were able to pass easily through the dense tangles of undergrowth and up the mountains). But humans, who depended on the wealth of all these domains—especially the sea—were nevertheless restricted to the edges of each. The raven rattle mimics this world structure. There is a sea creature below and a sky creature above, and they are fitted into one another with great ease (in some examples a liminal creature, the frog, serves as the tongue-communing intermediary facing the human). In contrast the human figure rides on top of the animals (or clings to them for dear life, as the rattle was often danced with the “bottom” on top). His whole body—rather scrawny, its legs and arms not much use in the air—may express a distinction deeper and more salient in Northwest Coast thought than even that between ecological zones: humans live on the mere surface of things, while animals inhabit the very architecture of the world.\nThe animals are a tumbling, living, fusing entity; the human is merely their passenger. He has arrived late on the scene and must undergo a complex ritual process in order to join with them. The raven rattle was used by chiefs at potlatches, and it has long been argued that the interaction of human and bird via the tongue represents the acquisition of spiritual power from an animal guardian during the vision quest, while the sea creature on the rattle’s belly symbolizes the wealth and prestige that come to a chief when the quest is fulfilled (the bottom of the sea was the great source of wealth, and its inhabitants were wealth’s symbols and deities). 14 Thanks to this ritual, the human does finally attain a connection to the animals: his body rests on theirs; his mouth receives power from their mouth. In this way the rattles become a rebus. On the one hand, they announce the difference between human and animal, man and universe, surface and depth. On the other, they illustrate the binding together of these seemingly irreparable oppositions by ritual and vision.\nThis sorting out of humans’ simultaneous distance from and connection to animals is on display in another rattle held in the Peabody collections (fig. 2 ). This is a type of shaman’s rattle made only by the Tlingit and shaped to resemble the oystercatcher (lugán in Tlingit), a shorebird with a brilliant orange beak and black plumage belonging to the genus Haematopus and often associated with shamans. In all of the oystercatcher rattles known to me, the birds form the main body of the instrument and carry carved scenes—almost always of shamans at work—on their backs. In the case of the dramatic Peabody rattle, a shaman binds a witch with the help of his spirit animals, one of whom emerges out of another’s head to touch mouths with (and perhaps battle or exorcise) an animal emerging from the witch’s chest.\nFigure 2.\nOystercatcher rattle, Tlingit, nineteenth century. 32 × 10 × 14 cm (12 5/8 × 3 15/16 × 5 1/2 in.). Museum Purchase, 1869. © President and Fellows of Harvard College, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, PM 69-30-10/1790.\nThis rattle illustrates two further principles underlying narrative in Northwest Coast art. The first principle: that animal beings are both actors in this world, and the stage upon which action takes place. The play of parts and wholes—a head emerging from a body, which then produces a head—requires the animals to take on many concurrent roles, as bases, frames, and agents. On the Peabody oystercatcher rattle, a head (perhaps a frog) emerges from the back of the bird, and from its cranium springs forth, Athena-like, a full frog (perhaps the same one, seen now as a body rather than a head); it’s this last creature, presumably at the shaman’s summoning, who fights the witch and the witch’s helper (likely a land otter, which is split in two and acts as a frame for the witch). On rattles, sentient beings interact in sentient frames or, better yet, frames are always figures, and figures must often serve as frames.\nThe second principle inheres in use: the rattles show us that there is always yet another frame of sentience that surrounds the one visible in the artifact. This is the human use of the rattle, in this case the shaman shaking it in the air over a suspected witch or sick person seeking a cure. A contrast with Western pictorial art may be broad, but nevertheless useful. In many Old Master paintings, beings are depicted within a series of inanimate frames. Imagine, say, a Poussin, in which figures are framed by an arbor, nestled within a temple, carefully surrounded by a landscape, and finally enclosed by a literal frame. In contrast, each representation on the Tlingit rattle is surrounded by layers of labile aliveness: the setting is as alive as the characters. The beings on top ride on a moving being (the oystercatcher), who is being moved by yet another moving being (the shaman). And if we consider that the shaman is likely being guided by a spirit animal (in Tlingit, a yéik) during his ritual, then that seemingly final moving being is actually being moved by yet another being, who may even be the very oystercatcher or land otter depicted on the rattle itself.\nThe paradox of emergent aliveness: G̱unakadeit\nMany cultures, it is claimed, understand the world to be alive. But what, precisely, does that mean? Is the world one living being? Many living beings? Are there things that are alive and things that are not? Are things alive insofar as they are perceived to share in some form of consciousness, or are they alive only in a more biological or abstract sense? (A still more sobering question, likely answerable only long after the fact, is whether an outsider writing in English can offer a plausible translation of the ontology of animism from a given time and place into the language of a scholarly essay.)\nA set of linked myths might give us a small hint as to how aliveness was conceptualized in the Northwest in the nineteenth century. These concern that underwater creature called in Tlingit G̱unakadeit, and in Haida often, though not always, wasgo. As we’ve seen, he is one of the figures associated with the bottom face of the raven rattle, and a key figure in the cosmic picture, living on the curved base of the world. He is a bringer of wealth and a monster from the deep. He may serve as an important test case for notions of aliveness because he cannot be seen in the everyday, like a raven or eagle. His aliveness is out of sight—and so the underlying metaphysics must come to the fore.\nTwo G̱unakadeit stories were recorded in English by John Swanton in his Tlingit Myths and Texts, published in 1909. 15 The first, told by Katishan, or Ḵaadasháan, a leader of the Kaasx̱’agweidí clan, concerns a lazy man, fond of gambling, who’s always being nagged and criticized by his mother-in-law. She thinks he wastes his days in idleness and doesn’t shy away from saying as much to the whole village. But in fact, he goes every day in secret to a deep lake and works at cutting down a tree on its shore. Eventually he fells the tree and splits it into a bifurcating trap. He stretches it over the surface of the lake and lays a line baited with salmon. A sea monster—“he saw that it had very sharp, strong teeth and that its claws looked like copper”—rises up to eat the salmon, and it’s caught and killed when the two halves of the tree snap shut. 16\nThe man skins this G̱unakadeit and puts on the skin, gaining the animal’s power. He swims down to the bottom of the lake, where he visits the animal’s splendid house, and discovers a tunnel leading out to sea. He swims to the ocean and starts catching fish and whales. He leaves them on the beach and arranges with his wife a scheme so that his mother-in-law will be the one to discover them lying there on the shore in front of the village. The catches grow ever more extravagant—a king salmon, a halibut, then two halibut, then a seal, and finally a whale. All the while the mother-in-law takes credit, claiming to be a powerful shaman, conspiring with spirits to bring food to the village.\nEventually the man exhausts his mortal powers, as he knows from the beginning will likely happen. He dies trying to liberate himself from the monster’s skin as it bursts onto the beach. His wife, who’s been warned of this possibility, comes down to the shore, pries his body from its sheath, and exposes her own mother as a sham before the whole village. The mother-in-law is so humiliated she drops dead. The wife (as her husband had instructed her to do) brings the dead man and his animal skin back to the lake, leaving them in the stump of the tree he had first used to make the trap. Then:\nEvery evening after this the dead man’s wife went to the foot of the tree which contained his body and wept. One evening, however, she perceived a ripple on the water, and looking up, saw the monster flopping around in the lake. Then the creature said to her, “Come here.” It was the voice of her husband. “Get on my back,” it said, “and hold tight.” She did so, and he swam down to the monster’s former house. This monster is the Gonaqade’t that brings good luck to those that see him. His wife also brings good luck to those who see her, and so do their children, “the Daughters of the Creek,” who live at the head of every stream. 17\nAlthough a great deal can be said about this story and the many iterations of it that appear on the Northwest Coast, we can limit ourselves for the time being to a discussion of what Ḵaadasháan suggests to his listeners about different forms of aliveness, human and supernatural.\nThere are certain living beings who are always just out of sight. The beings who constitute the powerful forces of the world do not manifest in the everyday life of the village, but rather live behind screens—in the woods, under the waves, beneath the still surface of a lake. They travel through the world by unknown and inaccessible conduits. For a sea monster, the freshwater lake and the ocean are connected, but by hidden paths that human beings cannot normally see or travel along. These beings likewise act in ways that can only be seen after the fact: the monster deposits food, but it hunts and travels under cover of night. The living beings of the world map a secret geography of action, giving a countershape to the world by their movements, a second world order unlike the one perceived from the threshold of a house looking out toward the water or the forest.\nAnother observation about living beings to be gleaned from this story is harder to formulate, but a first pass might be: nonhuman life is intimately connected to human life, but not in the ways it might seem to be. Public claims about privileged access to the hidden beings of the world—like the mother-in-law’s—are to be treated with skepticism. But there are nevertheless secret forms of access, usually carried out beyond the social world, triggered when a person withdraws from the village with its gossip and ambitions and seeks the solitude of the forest or the ocean. Here nonhuman life can be encountered and, in complex and even dangerous ways, fused with. The man kills the sea monster, but only to become the sea monster, and then be killed in turn by the sea monster skin, and then somehow to be resurrected once more, now irreversibly the sea monster and not a human, no longer able to return to the village—and this time even his wife and children must follow him to the nonhuman world.\nHere is the paradox of emergent aliveness: in the wilderness, aliveness is felt most intensely when it pops in and out of nowhere, when it jumps out from the bushes, or surges up from the water and drops back down again. 18 The most intense forms of nonhuman aliveness to permeate the world are the liminal ones—those that hide and reveal themselves in a flash before disappearing again. This jumping in and out of revealed aliveness is the source of power and wealth, and the conceit of this story of the G̱unakadeit is that a man might be able to share in this potency if only he can become an animal and live literally in its skin. 19 But again, a human cannot just annex an animal being or the power of emergent aliveness and remain as he was. He must go through a continuous process of moving between the animate and inanimate, between living and dying. Eventually, if he persists, he will no longer be a living human, but one of the beings in the nonhuman sphere of sentience, always just out of view. Among other things, this is an allusion to normal human-animal interactions, as any hunter or hiker knows. At best we see them for seconds, before they vanish into the secret world they inhabit. This story and others like it suggest something like a phenomenological ontology of nonhuman life. To become an animal is to live within the slipstream time that is the usual human perception of animal life.\nA human can enter the skin of the animal and so become it; this is elegantly mirrored by another important idea from the Northwest, namely that when animals (and monsters) are out of sight, they shed their skins and become humanoid, living and walking about in villages of their own. 20 This idea is at the center of the second G̱unakadeit story recorded by Swanton among the Tlingit, this one told to him by Kasank’ from the village of Kake. The story begins with a chief who, traveling at sea with his nephews, ties up his canoe for the night “to a dead tree hanging from a cliff. At midnight he felt the canoe shaking very hard. He jumped up and was terrified to see foam breaking almost over his canoe. Then he thought of a sea monster, and climbed up to the cliff by means of the dead tree. His nephews, however, went down with the canoe. A Gonaqade’t had swallowed them.” 21\nThe chief returns to the village and explains what has transpired. The people immediately prepare to set out and slay the monster, but the chief stops them and instead proposes inviting the G̱unakadeit to a feast at his home, in the hopes that he’ll return the nephews if treated generously. He dispatches a brave brother-in-law and other men of the village to offer hospitality to the G̱unakadeit. They paddle to the cliff where the nephews were lost and, as they shout their invitation into the air, a huge cloud of foam envelops the sea. Then the cliff cracks open and reveals a town, presided over by the G̱unakadeit who, when in human form, is a powerful chief. The G̱unakadeit agrees to return with them as their guest. He and his men travel by canoe to the human village, and a long potlatch ensues, during which the human chief gives many of his prized possessions to the sea-monster chief. But his nephews still fail to reappear, and he begins to wonder why he bothered to give this feast if the G̱unakadeit had no intention of giving them back:\nSoon after this thought had passed through the chief’s mind the Gonaqade’t called loudly to one of his men, “Bring me my box from over yonder.” This box was beautifully carved and painted, and it was from it that the Tsimshian came to know how to carve and paint boxes. Then he took out a chief’s dancing hat with sea lion bristles and a rattle, and just as soon as he had done so the chief’s eldest nephew stood beside him. … Then the Gonaqade’t went through the same actions as before. There had been twenty youths in the chief’s large canoe, and he gave each a hat, a rattle, and four songs, making them all stand on one side of the house. Now the village chief felt very happy and was glad that he had invited the Gonaqade’t to him instead of doing as the village people had planned. 22\nIt is important to note just how different Kasank’’s myth is from Ḵaadasháan’s. Within the Tlingit myth-world, this name and the character behind it are protean enough to be, depending on the teller, a chief who lives under the sea or a former human who lives in a lake, a bringer of wealth or a taker of nephews. Many other stories are told about this figure in all the northern languages, and in them this G̱unakadeit spirit might be described as a sea-wolf or sea-grizzly living in the lake, or as a long-eyed wealth spirit from the bottom of the sea, sometimes rising up from the deep in the shape of a giant house. 23 The mysterious aliveness to be seen in the depths of the sea and in the cosmic and numinous corners of the universe is plastic, can change form and shape even when it retains the same name across a corpus of myths. 24\nThe mystery of emergent aliveness is a key topos in Haida and Tlingit narrative. When beings first appear out of the forest or sea in such stories, they’re often just called “something”: then something spoke, or then something jumped out of the water.25 At first there is no name, no shape, just the presence of a being, indiscriminate, not yet woven into a web of story or kinship. This is a mimesis of surprise, the way a living being steals upon your proprioception, raising the hair on your neck before the cognitive faculties can offer a concrete explanation. Only after the initial shock of having encountered this being passes do a name and a description come into focus. And even then, the name and the description are not locked by culture into an unchanging relationship. Different descriptions and different names can attach and reattach to one another depending on who is telling the story, and for what purpose. In the case of this second story, that purpose says something about the complex mirroring of the social and natural ecology. Conflicts with sea monsters, like conflicts with humans, can be resolved by feasting and gift-giving. The protocols shared by humans and sea monsters constitute a whole political system—but the parallels cannot be seen with normal sight, for the sea-foam and dark waters of the perceptual world get in the way.\nThe aliveness of the world—in the case of this story, the aliveness of the sea in particular—is at first hidden, secret, emerging only sporadically and violently amid obscuring foam or dark waters. But once it can be truly looked at face-to-face, away from the village and its constraints, this aliveness turns out to be very much like human aliveness, a looking glass of all the things that make up human experience. And what is this looking glass made of? It is a razor-thin plane of matter: sea-foam, water-surface, dense thickets that are everywhere in the rainforests of the North Pacific. It is nonlife bracketed by the animate on either side, and contact between different forms of aliveness is achieved by passing through a thin membrane of nonbeing. To pass from one to the other, you must be able to go through this membrane by some form of death, which is itself conceived not as a permanent state, but as a thin boundary that can be traversed to reach other iterations of aliveness. 26 When nephews devoured by a sea monster are brought back to their home village and restored to their human status, their return is nothing less than a resurrection.\nBoxes, or envelopes of being\nAnd what is the instrument of resurrection? To use a (perhaps) anachronistic and out-of-context word: art. A beautifully painted box—in fact the ur-box, the template for all subsequent ones—contains rattles and hats that, when ritually removed, generate, in a supernatural metonymy, the nephews who wear and hold them. The pattern of emergent aliveness present in the larger architecture of the myth is reproduced in microcosm by the G̱unakadeit’s potlatch performance. From the concealed, hidden interior of the box, something is brought out, and that something then turns spectacularly into a someone. If the rattles are meant to be imagined as the raven rattles we’ve earlier discussed, then the image is also a mise en abyme. In the myth, a wealth-bringing sea creature regenerates humans by scooping rattles from the bottom of his box, and on those rattles are depicted humans riding on top of wealth-bringing sea creatures. Every element in this dizzying constellation of interactions can be understood in two ways at once: as a living being, and as the catalyst for the generation of a living being. Everything comes from the depths, but everything is also the surface across which the animate treasures of the deep world break forth. Everything is being, except when it is the envelope of being.\nNowhere is this dualism more intensely expressed than in boxes. In the great plank houses of the northern cultures, boxes had two functions that echoed these cosmic dramas in everyday life. The first, likely the older function, was as a vessel for cooking. 27 There were no implements capable of directly withstanding contact with fire, so instead, tightly sealed boxes—their sides made by kerfing, steaming, and bending a single plank of wood—were filled with water and heated rocks that made the water boil. Dead animals went into the boiling box and emerged as life-giving sustenance. This vessel was one more thin membrane between life and death, equal and opposite to the ocean surface across which a hooked halibut might burst, or the screen of reeds through which a duck could be spied.\nThe second function was to contain objects of splendor and pride: rattles, blankets, hats, headdresses, perhaps also preserved foodstuffs or tools. G̱unakadeit is the bridge between these two uses. He guards the living food-wealth at the bottom of the sea. Food-wealth, in turn, is what permits all other forms of wealth and power to accrue. It should come as no surprise that the box is not only associated with G̱unakadeit, but in some sense is him. An elaborate figure with an enormous face is typically depicted on the sides of the boxes, and this figure is very often said to be a wealth spirit from the bottom of the sea, often explicitly called G̱unakadeit, sometimes given other names.\nSpeaking about one of the masterpiece boxes of the nineteenth century, Wilson Duff told his students in an unpublished lecture, “But didn’t you find it strange … how little I could say about what it meant? ” 28 Surely a reader of this article will have found this strange, too: at every turn when talking about the art I have been careful to say that something might be a frog or supernatural snag, probably a G̱unakadeit unless some other underwater spirit. Now it’s time to address this vagueness head-on. Let me suggest that it’s not only a matter of context lost because of colonial depredation (though it is that also). I wish to claim that this indeterminacy is integral to the ideas expressed in and by the art.\nA box now in the Peabody Museum, collected in the late nineteenth century on Haida Gwaii, is at once highly typical for storage boxes and also an example of considerable elegance and refinement (fig. 3 ). The box is painted on two sides in a design that shows a humanoid animal figure but flirts with abstraction. Duff draws a distinction between what he calls the “iconographic” aspect of Northwest Coast art—its representation of specific beings, say, Raven or G̱unakadeit—and the “iconic” aspect, by which he means its display of form, its exploration of style:\nIconic design cannot exist alone, except as an esoteric exercise or as empty decoration. It requires a foundation of ordinary iconography on which to root and feed and grow, just as poetry needs a foundation in ordinary speech. Yet in order to get its messages across, it has to compete with the iconography for attention. It is a competition in which the iconography has a strong advantage, for the eye and mind strain first to recognize the icons and concepts of that realm, and are then tempted to rest, feeling that to know what it represents is to know what it means. The task of the artist is to draw the attention back into the design, pique it again to a high state of vigilance, and present it with the subtle pre-gestalt images and signs which convey the iconic meanings. 29\nLet us assume for a moment that (as is likely) this box is meant to represent G̱unakadeit or another wealth-hoarding creature of the submarine. We can see his face with its huge eyes, a pair of claws on either side, and in the center a face-form that may also be some kind of dorsal fin. But the essential characteristic of the work—if we are to believe Duff—is rather the exercise in emergence it engenders, the cognitive slip-and-slide triggered by looking at it, the bouncing back and forth between fixed representation and an unformed matrix of meaning, like “a flower coming into bloom.” 30 G̱unakadeit is always rising from the churning sea-foam: in this case the skein of ambiguity, the obscuring film of perceptual experience, is style itself. 31 Style is what hides content, keeps it below the surface. Yet it also embodies, once again, the paradox at the center of this system: being is constituted at the moment of its temporary emergence from occlusion. For style is both the obstacle to revealing the thing and also the constituent material of the thing itself.\nFigure 3.\nLarge storage box, likely Haida, nineteenth century, “recto” side. 75 × 56 × 46 cm (29 1/2 × 22 1/16 × 18 1/8 in.). © 2020 President and Fellows of Harvard College, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, PM 05-7-10/65521.\n“Haida art has no horizontal straight lines,” writes Duff in his notes. The classical Haida understood their world to be curved—except, speculates Duff, in the vertical dimension. “Trees grow straight up, men stand upright, everything upright (the world inclusive) has a centre straight line (is bilaterally symmetrical).” 32 The axis of the world is the meeting place of worldview and style; it is the equivalent of linear perspective in Western painting. 33 The curved, swelling world arrays itself around this line, and models itself especially on the bilateral symmetry of the face. I count four facelike arrangements displayed across the surface of this box: a pair of eyes with nostrils at the top, the large face with eyes and mouth just below, a pair of slanted eyes in the center, and a pair of perfectly round eyes with an inverted U for a mouth-form just below. 34 As almost always in Northwest Coast art, “eyes” are some manifestation of the ovoid, the rounded, calligraphic form that can vary between almost perfect circle and almost perfect rectangle. The eyes in the main face are further and conventional elaborations on the ovoid known as “salmon-trout’s-heads.” They are clearly another exploration of the face, such that smaller faces inhabit a larger face, in the way that a complex linguistic utterance might be composed of numerous figurations embedded in one another, some of them so conventionalized that their literal meaning is no longer accessible. The longer we look at the box, we see new lookers emerging to meet our gaze before receding into the labyrinth of form.\nOnce again, this is a being built of beings. The units of style by which the being is depicted are themselves formalized depictions of aliveness. The message is made still more complex when we look at the other side of the box, which seems to me what one might call its verso: much the same figure is depicted, but with telling differences (fig. 4 ). It is even more abstracted than the recto. The hands of the recto figure become matching pairs of sideways U ’s (perhaps evoking the shape of fins?), and the doubled and much elaborated mouth of the recto becomes just one long form. The inner ovoids (i.e., the “eyes” of the lower two “faces”) are given a much slacker shape. On the recto, one set is a tight pair of slits, the other perfect circles. On the verso, they have all released to less tense, less extreme ovoid forms. It’s as if the box encodes a complete cycle of breath, the recto a tight intake, and the verso a release.\nFigure 4.\nLarge storage box, “verso” side. © 2020 President and Fellows of Harvard College, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, PM 05-7-10/65521.\nOther metaphors are possible: the recto is hyper articulation, the verso a dissolving into abstraction. The recto is the emergence out of the foam, the verso a receding back into it. The principle should by now be familiar. Rattles are designed to be shaken. Transformation masks swing open to change one face into another. These boxes—which held within them rattles, masks, and other instruments of metamorphosis—operate on the same principle, though they are less theatrical. They are a meditation rather than a performance, offering possibilities for the static contemplation of an ontology in which nothing can be seen entirely at one glance, and in which the tension between surface and depth is paramount. Everything is always and forever arising out of its surroundings, dissolving back into them and, in the process, creating them. In the study of European art, such investigations at the cusp of perceptual recognition—for example, in the fantasias of Arcimboldo or Magritte—are often seen as frivolous and marginal. But here this suspension between the first apperception of a being and its identification is charged with the highest aesthetic value. It is a perceptual mimesis of the hunting eye, and in a hunting culture where interactions with nonhuman beings are the proving ground for life and death, such depictions might very well illustrate a society’s deepest concerns about knowing and existing.\nWhy Boas couldn’t see what Edenshaw was trying to show him\nThe ontology expressed in these oscillations is complex enough that I believe it benefits from a description (such as I’ve given here) independent of the major social institutions of Northwest Coast culture, like the potlatch and shamanism. Future work—beyond what can be done in these pages—may show that it also played a part in ceremony, healing, or the affirmation of privilege and rank. Still other work may one day investigate parallel forms of emergent aliveness in artistic traditions beyond the Northwest. For now, however, I’d like to explore one minor and speculative example of the social life of this principle, as it may have played out in a conversation between a great anthropologist and a great artist.\nThe example concerns one particular Northwest Coast box (sometimes called a bowl), which has haunted outsiders and insiders alike (figs. 5 – 6 ). Boas was puzzled by it but included a drawing of its surfaces in Primitive Art. It was in Primitive Art that the great Haida carver Bill Reid first saw this “masterpiece, whose outstanding qualities were apparent even in the small, inaccurate, unfinished rendering by which it is illustrated there.” 35 Reid, in turn, showed the box to Wilson Duff, and Duff was overwhelmed. The piece became the prime mover of his late thinking and writing. He named it “the final exam of Northwest Coast art.” 36\nFigure 5.\n“The Final Exam of Northwest Coast Art,” box, likely Tlingit, nineteenth century. 46 × 38.5 × 37 cm. AMNH 19 / 1233.

Altered from original colored image. Courtesy of the Bill Reid Estate and the Royal BC Museum and Archives.\nThe box, which inexplicably languishes in storage at the American Museum of Natural History, is painted on all four sides with a design of staggering complexity. Each side is divided into four quadrants, and opposite sides of the box seem to be paired by stylistic similarities (“recto” relates most directly to “verso,” “left side” to “right side”). Bill Reid called its unknown creator “The Master of the Black Field” because the lower right-hand quadrant of each side is painted in such a way as to reverse the normal arrangement of colors in the Northwest: red is used for the primary forms, and they are placed on a black field. But this great painter might also be called “The Master of the Hand and the Face,” for among other things, his work is a superb exploration of these two elements of the body, the main instruments of human (and animal?) communication. Eye-forms, mouth-forms, and hands (or claws) saturate the field of representation. On the sides with convex top edges—what I call recto and verso—combinations of hands and eyes seem to form a being across two quadrants, such that a face-form in the upper left and the claw in the lower right might make up a single being. On the smaller sides, with concave top edges, a hand and face appear side by side within a single quadrant, most notably in the upper left and more vaguely in the lower right.\nA full analysis of this box is beyond the scope of this essay, or the capacity of this writer. Duff spent a thousand notebook pages on it and couldn’t arrive at a conclusion. But I will hazard a few remarks in light of my earlier contentions.\nFranz Boas, as I’ve said, saw this box at the end of the nineteenth century and showed a sketch of its design to Charles Edenshaw (da.a xiigang), the greatest Haida artist of the era. Edenshaw explained that its four faces represented four iterations of Raven creating the world. He interpreted the different parts of the design in detail, and Boas dutifully recorded these remarks in Primitive Art (“The upper right hand rectangle of the first side he claimed to represent the head of the raven surmounted by the ear; the large eye to the left of it, in the left hand upper corner, the shoulder and under it the wing and tail,” etc.). 37 But Boas, bizarrely, thought the interpretation was nonsense. “Although obtained from Charles Edensaw [sic ], one of the best artists among the Haida,” he writes, “I consider it entirely fanciful.” 38\nWhy couldn’t Boas accept Edenshaw’s interpretation? He’s surprisingly coy on the matter, but I suspect it has to do, at least on the surface, with the simple fact that Boas, though in general a man of great intellectual open-mindedness, couldn’t make out what Edenshaw was describing. No matter how precise the linguistic description became, Boas could not harmonize it with his own perceptual experience. 39 The box’s four sides with all of their geometric profuseness are meant, says Edenshaw, to be understood as one figure, a figure containing all of its narrative actions and characteristics—perhaps even the world it made—within its bodily boundaries. For Boas, such a cosmic Raven would not emerge from the sea of form.\nPerhaps Boas could not understand the philosophy of representation displayed on this box and others like it. A stable perceptual relationship to an image is not the end goal of this art. Instead the painting seems meant to keep us as long as possible in the state at which a distinct shape is just about to emerge, and also always just about to disappear again. Which is not to say that Edenshaw was wrong: personally I see no reason to doubt him. But it may perhaps be said that the artistic styles of the Northwest require of viewers not only an act of recognition, but also that they linger in the process that precedes recognition, that is, in the cognitive zone where they sense someone or something before they determine exactly who or what. A figure is the whole world insofar as any part of the world could, in the blink of an eye, turn into the figure.\nSuch an aesthetic is fundamentally linked to hunting, to the epistemology of myth, to ceremony and rank, and to orality. The conventions of description that develop alongside it (Charles Edenshaw—carver, chief, hunter, storyteller—saying this is the Raven) are inevitably going to be different from those possible within a textual society, where a picture and its textual description (at the simplest level, its title) are supposed to march hand in hand through the ages (even if in reality the situation is almost never so straightforward). “A mythology is not a fixed body of stories,” writes Robert Bringhurst, “it is an open set. It is a narrative ecology: a watershed, a forest, a community of stories that are born and die and breed with one another and with stories from outside.” 40 We should not imagine that this metamorphic ecology was restricted to verbal artifacts. Objects also moved within a structure of meaning that was constantly reconstituting itself through oral storytelling, performance, gifting, acquisition through purchase or warfare—all of which no doubt in turn influenced the style and content and ceremonial use of future objects. Charles Edenshaw may never have seen that box before, and it may, for all we know, have merely been his intuition that gave rise to his Raven ekphrasis. But even if that’s true, we shouldn’t discount it: for even then it would represent a form of in-the-moment meaning-making, no doubt governed by its own strict and complex rules, constituting a discipline of the intellect that made possible, like during the patient watching of a hunt, the sudden apperception of an animal. Out of that first spark of perceived aliveness came the construction of a narrative, the evocation of a tradition, and the tracing of a cosmology: in fact, the making of the world into what it is.\nRaven puts all things in place. He flies over the water and by blundering, goofing, stealing, losing, dropping, and gift-giving, he redistributes life and sustenance, turning an unequal world into a balanced one. His curiosity and nosiness are insatiable and key. He’s always looking under rocks, behind screens or in boxes, stealing whatever he finds there, often turning into the very beings he meets. (When, in the great Haida account given by Skaay of the Ḵ’uuna Ḵiig̱awaay, Raven goes to meet the Old Man of the Sea, this quasi-G̱unakadeit says to him, “You are me, and you are that too,” pointing at “something blue and slim” on the house screen. 41) In many Haida accounts of the creation, human beings emerge when Raven discovers them under a clamshell. Raven is the greatest uncoverer of hidden aliveness, and this is, I think, a more accurate description of his persona than the anthropological archetypes of “creator” or “culture-hero.” A being bumping into beings—like flint on a stone—is the mechanism by which time and space come into existence. Perhaps one of the deep philosophical messages encoded in Haida and Tlingit art is that beings always already stretch across the entire surface of the world, just beneath its membrane, and that the beginning is never an arrival but rather a meeting with what’s already there. This makes living in the world a difficult proposition, requiring delicate negotiations at every turn, for any claim a sentient being stakes out will necessarily overlap with another claim already in place, and the relation between the claims will have to be adjudicated when the two beings meet each other through a curtain of foliage or foam. The arrangement is by no means always harmonious: violence or cunning sometimes puts one class of being temporarily on top. But as often as not, you invite the sea monster or the bear to a feast, and you always know a priori that there is no pure space, no abstract time, no omnipotent stance in relation to the world—even among the gods and spirits. Edenshaw’s description of the box as a cosmogony (rather than, say, as a particular clan’s crest animal or a wealth spirit) may have been his attempt to help Boas understand this worldview, and all of the many flexible but nevertheless binding entailments it expressed.\nWithout contact between living beings, there is nothing. The point may seem obvious, yet it is pathologically occluded by a colonial ideology that imagines inert resources to be the measure of prestige and power. The first century of white-Native relations in the Northwest was a nightmare paradox of apotheosis and annihilation. There was dizzying prosperity—new sources of wealth, incredible artistic energy, potlatching reaching new heights—and also the terrible depredations of disease, in some places killing off as much as ninety percent of the indigenous population within a generation. 42 In a short time this holocaust would permit whites to take almost all the land and attempt a cultural genocide on those Natives who had survived. The staggering sum of art made during this time, its forms overspreading every surface with emergent beings, may have been an attempt to reiterate and renew a world picture that whites were actively trying to unstitch from the world one law at a time, a world picture that simultaneously found itself at the height of its powers, and on the cusp of devastation. To cover the surfaces of reality with beings who achieve their existence in the sudden, even violent, act of apperception might have been a statement that such beings are not just everywhere, but in some sense every thing. The human relationship to other beings is neither a mere allegory for intrahuman social relations nor an encounter with something completely alien and opposite. Rather, we truly encounter other living beings (including, in some cases, other humans) in tiny bursts of atavistic apperception, bursts in which all the key ethical possibilities (killing or making offerings to, occupying or withdrawing from, starving or feeding, taking or giving away, dominating or submitting to) are entertained and, in an instant, tested. The actions triggered by those pulsations are what make our world. Correct behavior in such key moments should be a central goal of education and maturation—for the integrity of the universe is at stake.\nThere are many people nowadays who profess an abstract respect for the sentience that surrounds us. But our understanding of that sentience is obscured by an environmentalist sentimentalism that all too often stakes out one of two extreme claims: either it maintains that there is a complete divorce between an idealized nature and a debased humanity, or it proffers a vague and utopian notion that everything is somehow interconnected. 43 In this moment of considerable environmental and political danger, there is an urgent need for everyone (and especially the inheritors of settler colonialism) to study indigenous accounts of the world’s aliveness, to learn something of their sophistication, balance, and even ambivalence. On the Northwest Coast—at least in my no doubt incomplete and preliminary reading—these accounts suggest that the world is created by an imbricated, nested, hidden, appearing-and-disappearing sentience. This sentience is best understood not as inhabiting fixed realms like “the sea” or “the village,” nor as divided into fixed categories like “human” or “animal,” but as arising from sudden flashes of contact, which only afterward produce the structures of meaning by which they can be explained and judged.\nNotes\nMy sincerest thanks to Robert Bringhurst and Will Geiger for offering comments and corrections to this essay. Errors and idiosyncrasies of interpretation are my own.\n1. The traditional women’s art of the Northwest Coast, manifest in weaving and basketry, tends to feature more abstract repeating designs. But there are those who would claim that even these forms encode the traces of living beings. See, e.g., C. Schuster and E. Carpenter, Materials for the Study of Social Symbolism in Ancient and Tribal Art, vol. 2, bk. 3 (New York, 1988), 669.\n2. B. Holm, Northwest Coast Indian Art: An Analysis of Form, 50th Anniversary Edition (Seattle, 2015), 9.\n3. F. Boas, Primitive Art (Oslo, 1927), 185.\n4. Holm, Northwest Coast Indian Art, 12.\n5. Such work went hand in hand with new carving and painting and was part of the extraordinary project of cultural revival sometimes called the Northwest Coast Renaissance, spearheaded by Native artists like Bill Reid and Mungo Martin. See “Artists’ Reflections,” in Holm, Northwest Coast Indian Art, xv–xx. Holm and a number of others developed an English vocabulary—useful for scholars as well as carvers—that described the formal system underlying this art, based as it is on a geometry as complex and coherent as anything in Euclid. Terms like ovoid, salmon-trout’s-head, trigon, and U -shape entered the lexicon of the Northwest Coast, serving as linguistic mirrors of an artistic grammar that had been in play for centuries. For work undertaken to resituate the masterpieces of the nineteenth century in their time and place, see, e.g., B. Holm, “Will the Real Charles Edenshaw Please Stand Up? The Problem of Attribution in Northwest Coast Art,” in The World Is as Sharp as a Knife: An Anthology in Honour of Wilson Duff, ed. D. Abbott (Victoria, BC, 1981), 175–200. See also R. Wright, Northern Haida Master Carvers (Seattle, 2001), especially her sections on Duncan ginaawaan (175–211) and Albert Edward Edenshaw (125–35). Objections to some of the intellectual and political shortcomings of this approach are addressed in Robert Bringhurst’s review of Wright’s book in Oregon Historical Quarterly 103, no. 3 (2002): 398–99. Finally, there is a long-standing critique of the vocabulary of “renaissance.” See, e.g., A. Glass, “History and Critique of the ‘Renaissance’ Discourse,” in Native Art of the Northwest Coast: A History of Changing Ideas, ed. C. Townsend-Gault, J. Kramer, Ḳi-ḳe-in (Vancouver, BC, 2013), 487–517.\n6. The “northern Northwest Coast” is usually understood to be the region inhabited by the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian (including the linguistically related NisG̱a’a and Gitxsan) peoples, roughly along the coast from north of Vancouver Island to Yakutat in Alaska. The artistic styles of this region were closely linked, such that artworks are often difficult to distinguish between the three (this is more true of two-dimensional painting and weaving than sculpture). For the purposes of this essay, I regret I will not be spending much time on the wonderful art of Tsimshian-speaking cultures, if only because I’m too little versed in their myth traditions and because the present constraints of length make it impossible. As we move farther south along the rich cultures of the coast—for example, Kwakw a k a ’wakw, Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk, Salish, among others—artistic style changes along a continuum, and though some of the principles in this essay might hold constant, others may change, or manifest differently in interaction with yet other aesthetic and philosophical ideas.\n7. If some maintain that in many Native languages there is no equivalent word for “philosophy,” there is nevertheless no doubt in my mind that the highest intellectual work—“love of wisdom,” explicit and implicit—went on in these cultures. Sometimes one must use a Western vocabulary to try to understand it—if nothing else, then as a stopgap until we can truly “decolonize” the mind. For positions on this, see A. Jonaitis, “Creations of Mystics and Philosophers: The White Man’s Perceptions of Northwest Coast Indian Art from the 1930s to the Present,” American Indian Culture and Research Journal 5, no. 1 (1981): 1–45; D. Sewid-Smith, “Interpreting Cultural Symbols of the People from the Shore,” in Townsend-Gault et al., Native Art of the Northwest Coast, 15–25, and Ḳi-ḳe-in, “Art for Whose Sake?,” in ibid., 677–719. See also the opening remarks of Richard and Nora Marks Dauenhauer, Haa Shuká, Our Ancestors: Tlingit Oral Narratives (Seattle, 1987), ix–xii, along with their epigraph from T. S. Eliot’s “Tradition and the Individual Talent.”\n8. See, e.g., E. N. Anderson’s “A Final Assessment” in the volume he edited, Bird of Paradox: The Unpublished Writings of Wilson Duff (Blaine, WA, 1996), 106–15.\n9. Many contemporary Haida and Tlingit artists also foreground this cosmological aspect. See, e.g., Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas’s Haida Cosmic (2014), https://mny.ca/en/work/8/Haida%20Cosmic.\n10. The nearby whale-hunting Nuu-chah-nulth of Vancouver Island, for example, produced woven hats painted with scenes of whale hunts that show a clear narrative structure, set in a spatialized context: canoes pursue whales that breach the waterline, and harpoons are cast, and though the sea and sky are not explicitly depicted, they exist as nonfigural space.\n11. Often objects simply are status. Hats or shirts or masks are the physical instantiation of certain privileges and historical events belonging to a lineage. Among the Tlingit especially, such art objects (at.óow) are brought out at potlatches to serve as inspiration for spectacular oratory: members of a clan will expound upon a salmon shirt or an ancient war helmet, and ekphrasis of a thing will be the portal that opens onto the history of a family, a people, a place. See Haa Tuwunáagu Yís, for Healing Our Spirit: Tlingit Oratory, ed. N. M. Dauenhauer and R. Dauenhauer (Seattle, 1990), 14–23.\n12. W.

Bringhurst, The Black Canoe: Bill Reid and the Spirit of Haida Gwaii (Seattle, 1991), 68–71. This being is also sometimes said to be a hawk, though I am inclined to think that its identification with a sea creature is more commonly the case.\n14. J. C. Gould, “The Iconography of the Northwest Coast Raven Rattle” (MA thesis, University of British Columbia, 1973), 172–83.\n15. J. R. Swanton, Tlingit Myths and Texts (Washington, DC, 1909), 165–73. Unfortunately Swanton recorded these stories only in English. I have changed Tlingit names to the current orthography except when quoting in the stories themselves (i.e., Ḵaadasháan instead of Swanton’s Katishan, but Swanton’s “Gonaqade’t” rather than “G̱unakadeit”). Similar stories can be found told by mythtellers all over the Northwest, including in J. R. Swanton, Haida Texts and Myths: Skidegate Dialect (Washington, DC, 1905), 282–85. Two more versions can be found in J. R. Swanton, Haida Texts: Masset Dialect (Leiden, 1908), 612–24. All three of these stories were recorded by Swanton in Haida, and later translated by him into English.\n16. Swanton, Tlingit Myths and Texts, 166.\n17. Swanton, Tlingit Myths and Texts, 169.\n18. For a broader treatment of this phenomenon, which I believe appears in artistic traditions around the world, see M. Spellberg, “The Chimeric Image in Perception: A First Exploration,” Southwest Review 99, no. 1 (2014): 92–116.\n19. The complexity of this operation is best encapsulated by a story recorded by Swanton in Massett Haida about a hero named Gōttca who, after being unintentionally abandoned by his brothers-in-law, enters a sea lion’s stomach and creates whales who bring his starving relatives food. In this way he helps his family, but having entered (and mastered) the animal world, he can never return to his village. The story ends with, “Since he entered a sea-lion’s stomach, he lives forever in the hearts of sea-lions. Their hearts are human. And he also made killer-whales.” Swanton, Haida Texts: Masset Dialect, 392. See also M. Spellberg, “The Sea-Lion Stomach of Desire,” Mitos Magazín, no. 1 (2018), http://www.mitosmag.com/the-sea-lion-stomach-of-desire.\n20. “According to the Haida spirit-theory, every animal was, or might be, the embodiment of a being who, at his own pleasure, could appear in the human form. They seem to be looked at from two entirely different points of view.” J. Swanton, Contributions to the Ethnology of the Haida (Leiden, 1905), 16. Likewise in the Tlingit myth-world, “mountains seem like logs, time is warped, animals appear as humans, and humans as animals.” Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer, Haa Shuká, 24. Hunters were intimately acquainted with the insides of animals and knew that their lungs, livers, veins, and muscles looked much like our own. The idea that animals were humans under an animal skin may have been a way of expressing our deep physiological kinship with them.\n21. Swanton, Tlingit Myths and Texts, 170.\n22. Swanton, Tlingit Myths and Texts, 173.\n23. R. Bringhurst, A Story as Sharp as a Knife: The Classical Haida Mythtellers and Their World, 2nd ed. (Vancouver, BC, 2011), 104–5. The G̱unakadeit is also associated with the Copper—a large shield made out of copper with a raised T -form in the center, preeminent symbol of wealth and prestige. It is sometimes said to be G̱unakadeit’s forehead, and a mask from the Haida town of Kasaan in Alaska (UCLA, Fowler Museum, X65.4280) shows him with a house framing his face—a house that also resembles the shape of the Copper. It has been argued that the Copper may in turn be a representation of the human body or a “cosmogram,” or both. Once again we see a deep imbrication of G̱unakadeit, his human interlocutors, and the larger cosmic structure generated by the two of them in their interactions with one another. See M. de Widerspach-Thor, “The Equation of Copper,” in Abbott, The World Is as Sharp as a Knife, 157–74. An exhibit at the Haida Heritage Centre at Ḵay Llnagaay suggests that the shape of the copper comes from a scale in a sea turtle’s forehead. Sea turtles appear on the coast when they are blown there by storms, which may also have delivered the remnants of East Asian shipwrecks—hence the association with the wealth-giving spirit.\n24. G̱unakadeit may be the paradigm-case for this plasticity—something which also holds uncannily true for his ancient Greek analogue, the now-proverbial sea-god Proteus.\n25. Sometimes Swanton signals this right away in the titles he gave to the stories, as in “How Something Pulled a Row of Eagles into the Water”; Swanton, Haida Texts and Myths: Skidegate Dialect, 271–76.\n26. In many myths, this teleportation is achieved by jumping into a fire, allowing the hero to emerge from another fire elsewhere, perhaps within the myth-world, or in a shaman’s faraway house. See, e.g., the beginning of “The Canoe People Who Wear Headdresses,” told by G̱andll of the Ḵayahl ‘Laanas (Walter McGregor) to Swanton, Haida Myths and Texts: Skidegate Dialect, 36.\n27. H. Stewart, Cedar: Tree of Life to the Northwest Coast Indians (Vancouver, BC, 1984), 84–86. I make the claim that cooking was the first use of the box as it seems to have been the main “practical” use—usually the more elaborately decorated boxes were used for trading and storage. It’s not impossible that storage preceded cooking, but the uniquely watertight nature of the container, the remarkable technique developed for bending a single piece of wood, and the importance of food and feasting make me surmise that cooking deserves pride of place. The expansion of the box’s functionality from cooking to storage may be one of the points of Kasank’’s story. These nephews who were thought to have been eaten were in fact in containment, waiting to be brought out and reconstituted.\n28. W. Duff, Lecture A.301, February 4, 1972, Wilson Duff Fonds 44.18, Museum of Anthropology Archives, University of British Columbia.\n29. W. Duff, “Levels of Meaning in Haida Art,” in Anderson, Bird of Paradox, 181.\n30. “emergence—the design emerges from the field—in ovoid fields, an upwelling with salmon trout heads—complex—ovoids get as large as practical—whole design pushes (pushed) out to edges of field, like out on a surface of water, like a flower coming into bloom.” W. Duff, Northwest Coast Research, Notes from April 20, 1972, Wilson Duff Fonds 46.1, Museum of Anthropology Archives, University of British Columbia.\n31. Style’s inveterate switching between wholes and parts is magnificently described by Jeff Dolven: “Style holds things together, things and people, schools and movements and periods. It makes us see wholes where we might be bewildered by parts.—But it makes us see parts, too. Say you are asked to identify or describe a style, to account for an act of recognition. … You might pick out a detail like a figure of speech or a quality of line, and you might well find a name for it, isocolon or crosshatching.” J. Dolven, Senses of Style: Poetry Before Interpretation (Chicago, 2017), 1.\n32. W. Duff, Northwest Coast Research, Notes from April 20, 1972, Wilson Duff Fonds 46.1, Museum of Anthropology Archives, University of British Columbia.\n33. For the importance of the world axis in the Northwest, see G. MacDonald, Haida Monumental Art: Villages of the Queen Charlotte Islands (Vancouver, BC, 1983), 18–19.\n34. There may be more, but four is a powerful and important number in the Northwest (and throughout much of Native North America), and this composition seems dominated by fours: there are four symmetrical U shapes at the very bottom, and four salmon-trout’s-head forms generating the main eyes and the lower limbs.\n35. B. Reid, “The Master of the Black Field,” in Solitary Raven: The Essential Writings of Bill Reid, ed. R. Bringhurst (Vancouver, BC, 2009), 171. The box was collected by George Emmons among the Chilkat in Tlingit territory in the 1880s (he recorded it as depicting a seal). Many scholars have naturally assumed it was made by a Tlingit artist, though stylistically it could also be Haida—boxes were often traded or gifted as prestige items. Duff, for his part, was convinced the work was by Albert Edward Edenshaw (gwaaygu 7anhlan, later holder of the chiefly title 7idansuu), a powerful chief, renowned carver, and uncle of Charles Edenshaw. Most other scholars have discounted this theory, though I believe I know why Duff wanted so fervently to believe it: Albert Edward, as Duff constantly mentions in his notes, was a Haida who successfully navigated European contact and died a rich and powerful man, having (at least in Duff’s account) entered modernity on his own terms, and benefited from it. He represented the last generation of Natives to be able to do so, coming to rest on his laurels just as the balance of power became forever altered in the Northwest. I believe Duff was fixated on the fantasy of an alternative history—represented for him by the brilliant box—in which Native culture flourished even after contact and changed the European world and mind-set as much as the other way around. Incidentally Albert Edward, one of the most extraordinary figures in Haida history, was particularly connected to the G̱unakadeit: it served as the decoration for his house screen, and the main pole of the house associated with him depicted the myth of the lazy son-in-law catching the wasgo (susan in Northern Haida). See Wright, Northern Haida Master Carvers, 138, 144–45, 262–63.\n36. Duff, Bird of Paradox, 142.\n37. Boas, Primitive Art, 275–76.\n38. Boas, Primitive Art, 275.\n39. In fact, it was likely not that precise, as Boas and Edenshaw were communicating in Chinook Jargon, a trade vernacular that neither was entirely at home in. Bringhurst, A Story as Sharp, 143.\n40. Bringhurst, A Story as Sharp, 287.\n41. In Swanton, Haida Myths and Texts: Skidegate Dialect, 111, this passage is translated slightly differently (“I am you. That [also] is you”). But the original Haida, as Robert Bringhurst pointed out to me in a personal communication, is “Diihau dang iiji. Waa’asing dang iiji”: “You are me. You are that, too.” See the transcription of Swanton’s typescript in R. Bringhurst, “Raven Travelling: Page One. A Lost Haida Text by Skaai of the Qquuna Qiighawaai,” Canadian Literature 144 (1995): 106.\n42. See Robert Boyd’s classic The Coming of the Spirit of Pestilence: Introduced Infectious Diseases among Northwest Coast Indians 1774–1874 (Vancouver, BC, 1999).\n43. In this the environmental movement reproduces what Bruno Latour calls the “modern Constitution,” which allows us “moderns” to sometimes claim nature and culture are not at all connected, and other times that they indissolubly are—and yet never acknowledge the contradiction. See B. Latour, We Have Never Been Modern, trans. C. Porter (Cambridge, MA, 1993). It might be said that the ontology of the Northwest embraces that contradiction rather than denying it exists.\narticle article\nback\nback", "Quick Answer: Why Did The Northwestern Tribe Art Draw Animal - SeniorCare2Share\nQA\nQuick Answer: Why Did The Northwestern Tribe Art Draw Animal\nTable of Contents\nHow did the Northwest Coast tribes use animals?\nWhat did the Northwest Indians do for art?\nWhy did Native Americans draw?\nWhat animal was most important to the Northwest Native Americans?\nWhat animals did the Northwest hunt?\nWhat animal was important to West Coast tribes?\nWhat is Pacific Northwest art called?\nWhat is the name of the Northwest Coast cultures specific art style?\nWhat are some artifacts in the Northwest coast?\nHow many spirit animals does each tribe get up to on the totem pole?\nWhy did Indians draw on rocks?\nWhy did Native Americans draw on rocks?\nWhat Predators did native Americans have?\nDid natives eat elk?\nWhat did the Northwest tribes believe in?\nHow did the Northwest tribes use their natural resources?\nWhat did the Northwest tribe eat?\nHow did the Northwest Native Americans survive?\nWhat tribe made silver and turquoise jewelry?\nWhat weapons did the Pacific Northwest use?\nWhat did the Northwest tribes wear?\nWhat kind of homes did the northwest coast live in?\nWhat are a few of the distinctive features of Northwest Coast Aboriginal art?\nHow did the Northwest Coast tribes use animals?\nAmong the Northwest Coast First Nations, dogs were often kept as pets and dogs were never eaten. Several of the tribes used dogs in hunting mountain goats and deer. The dogs were used to drive the animals to the hunters and/or into the water where they could easily be taken.  The dogs also carried packs.\nWhat did the Northwest Indians do for art?\nTraditional art forms include baskets, hats, capes, blankets, carved wooden household items, masks, paddles, canoes, totem poles, screens, bentwood boxes, stone carvings, and copper works. Northwest Coast art tells stories, teaching history and passing wisdom from generation to generation.\nWhy did Native Americans draw?\nMany American Indian art objects are basically intended to perform a service—for example, to act as a container or to provide a means of worship. The particular utilitarian form that Native American arts take often reflects the social organization of the cultures involved.\nWhat animal was most important to the Northwest Native Americans?\nOne of the most awesome creatures in both real life and in Pacific Northwest Native Indian art is the orca or killer whale. Feared many years ago but now loved by millions of people around the world, the killer whale is one of the most prominent subjects for Northwest Native artists.\nWhat animals did the Northwest hunt?\nNorthwest Coast peoples varied their fish-based diet through hunting and gathering. Families traveled to the mountains, where the men hunted deer, elk, mountain goat, and bear. The women collected bulbs, roots, berries, and seeds.\nWhat animal was important to West Coast tribes?\nHunting, both on land and sea, was also an important source of food. At sea this involved hunting whales, sea lion, porpoise, seal and sea otter, while deer, moose and elk were pursued on land. The plentiful supply of all these animals meant that the tribes became prosperous.\nWhat is Pacific Northwest art called?\nNorthwest Coast art is the term commonly applied to a style of art created primarily by artists from Tlingit, Haida, Heiltsuk, Nuxalk, Tsimshian, Kwakwaka’wakw, Nuu-chah-nulth and other First Nations and Native American tribes of the Northwest Coast of North America, from pre-European-contact times up to the present.\nWhat is the name of the Northwest Coast cultures specific art style?\nNorthwest Coast Native art is very well known globally, primarily for the monumental totem poles and spectacular masked performances of the First Peoples of the northwestern British Columbia and Alaska.\nWhat are some artifacts in the Northwest coast?\nSkagit atlatl (spear thrower) Swinomish, Puget Sound Salish, Washington State.

Identification Number: 1100/1. Tlingit seal effigy bowl.\nHow many spirit animals does each tribe get up to on the totem pole?\nNative American tradition provides that each individual is associated with nine different animals that will complement each person through life, acting as guides.\nWhy did Indians draw on rocks?\nSome rock art sites may have been associated with hunting magic and ceremonies. Among most of the North American tribes, it was felt that animals had spirits controlling their behavior.\nWhy did Native Americans draw on rocks?\nScientists believe that rock art was not generally developed as art for its own sake. For the most part, these forms were created as a part of spiritual or shamanistic rituals and hold their meaning within that context.\nWhat Predators did native Americans have?\nSlide 25: Most creator figures in Indigenous traditions are predators as are most clan moieties. For example in the Pacific Northwest the four common clans are Eagle, Killer Whale (Orca), Wolf, and Bear.\nDid natives eat elk?\nElk meat is a traditional, staple food of many indigenous cultures.  The hdes, hooves, antlers and other wildlife parts are used for traditional ceremonial items and regalia. Hunting elk also mean sustaining its future by protecting its habitat.\nWhat did the Northwest tribes believe in?\nHistorically, Pacific Northwest Indians shared their spiritual beliefs and customs through stories, songs and dances. Their beliefs were based in animism, where the natural world interacts with a supernatural world. In most native cultures, shamans or medicine men served as spiritual intermediaries.\nHow did the Northwest tribes use their natural resources?\nWhile these groups utilized other important parts of their environments, the water sources are a common theme they share. These people all used fishing or whaling as a way of sustaining themselves. Additionally, the hilly terrain allowed for gathering, hunting, fur trading, and grazing of animals.\nWhat did the Northwest tribe eat?\nSalmon was a major source of food, along with other fish such as trout, halibut and herring, followed by acorns, hundreds of different plants, marine mammals (whales, otters, seals), bears, beavers, lynx, deer, and small game like rabbits and hares.\nHow did the Northwest Native Americans survive?\nThe ocean and the lush coastal forests provided the Northwest Coast people with everything that they needed to survive. Tribes carved huge canoes made from cedar or spruce trees.  During winter, people moved into cedar houses that were large enough for many families to share. Often these homes had totem poles outside.\nWhat tribe made silver and turquoise jewelry?\nDescendants of the ancient Anasazi people, the Santo Domingo tribe is known for their shell, silver, and turquoise jewelry.\nWhat weapons did the Pacific Northwest use?\nThe Northwest Coast People had many different kinds of weapons. For example, they had spears, clubs, and daggers. Second they also had chisels, drills, and a stone hammer. Third, they also had darts, an atlas , a d-shaped adze.\nWhat did the Northwest tribes wear?\nKwakwaka’wakw clothes were the cedarbark garments common all over the Northwest Coast: capes and hats for protection from rain, robes for cold weather, and women’s aprons. Many garments were decorated with dentalia shells. Colorful nose ornaments were made of abalone shell.\nWhat kind of homes did the northwest coast live in?\nIn the Northwest region, Native Americans lived in plank houses. These homes were made from long, flat planks of cedar wood attached to a wooden frame. Plank houses were perfect for living in cold climates. They also could fit more then one family.\nWhat are a few of the distinctive features of Northwest Coast Aboriginal art?\nWood sculpture and painting, notably totem poles, are the most renowned features of Northwest Coast Indigenous culture. Archaeological evidence suggests that such artistic traditions have a long history in the area and that regional styles share basic similarities of form with an earlier tradition.", "Culture\nCulture\nThe Northwest's abundance of resources allowed indigenous people to develop a rich culture of artistic, religious and ceremonial traditions.\n\nThe region's exclusively male artists specialized in distinctive carvings that depicted animal, monster and human forms.  The figures represented supernatural beings whose spirits gave the artist permission to render their likeness.  An animal species was distinguished by one or two prominent\nfeatures.  For example, the bear was characterized by a stubby snout, large teeth and a protruding tongue, while the beaver was portrayed with protruding teeth, a cross-hatched tail and a stick between its forepaws.  By borrowing the features of more than one species, a monster could be depicted.  Carvings were painted in red and black and sometimes incorporated into elaborate masks.  When white people introduced iron tools, totem poles were created.  These tall, cylindrical objects were carved from a tree trunk and indicated their owners' prestige.\n\nThe religion of the Northwest Native Americans was closely tied to nature.  They believed that animal and human lives were inextricably intertwined.  Animals were intelligent, willful beings and should be treated with respect.  Other beliefs involved an afterlife, which was a continuation of earthly life, a sense of the natural order as slippery and fluid, and various myths that explained creation.  Shamans were important to the religion and cured disease by realigning spiritual elements.  Shamans honed their skills by going on frequent retreats and practicing sexual and dietary abstinence.\n\nMuch ritual activity focused on food.  For example, an elaborate salmon festival was held to honor the first catch of the year.  The fish were treated as chiefs of high rank in the hope that their souls would spread the news of their good fortune and attract other fish to be harvested.  Another key ceremony was the hamatsa dance.  Performed by the Kwakiutl tribe in the winter, the ritual dealt with the hamatsa, a human who had been carried off by spiritual beings.  After learning the ways of the spirits, the hamatsa escaped and returned to the human realm, only to find that human expression was too weak for his new divine energy.  The dance depicted the hamatsa going berserk, requiring a dozen tribe members to restrain him.  Though Potlatches were more secular by nature, they were also important rituals that dealt with wealth and social organization.\nSee Indian Wars Time Table .", "The Art of the Northwest Coast American Indians\nNovember 5, 2015 Leave a Comment\nThe Art of the Northwest Coast American Indians\nNovember is Native American Heritage Month, so this month, I will be dedicating the whole month of posts to Native American artworks!\nI’m going to start the series with some of my favorite art objects from the native cultures from the Northwest Coast of North America.\nMore than 16 nations make up this grouping including Tlingit, Haida, Heiltsuk, Nuxalk, Tsimshian, and Kwakwaka’wakw. Although each group has it’s own unique culture and art, they do share some commonalities, and I am highlighting some of the art forms that cross between many of the groups.\nThe Northwest coast has rich forests, rivers, and rocky coastlines. Their art reflected this environment. Much of their art was created with the abundant trees from the area and featured animals found in the forests, rivers, and oceans such as eagles, beavers, whales, wolves, ravens, frogs, and bears.\nThese animals had special meanings and symbols and individual clans had animals associated with their clan. For example, whales symbolize ancient wisdom and awareness, beavers stand for creative and artistic ability, and frogs symbolize spring and new life.\nSome of the Northwest Coast groups incorporated these animals onto totem poles, which are super tall sculptures made from the trunk of a tree, usually cedar. The designs usually include stacks of stylized animals done in an abstract and bold way.\n** Read more … See my post about Tlingit totem poles.\nPhoto Credit: Ryan Bushby\nThe totem poles were often in front of long, narrow houses where up to 50 people from the same clan lived all together. These houses were also decorated in bold abstract animal designs as well. Totems represent the history of the clan/family. In addition to the special symbolism of the animals, the colors have special meanings as well.\nOn my trip to NYC in the summer of 2014, I discovered Kwakiutl transformation masks at the American Museum of Natural History. I found them to be so intriguing and like nothing I had seen before. The masks are interactive: beaks would be attached to strings to make it open and close making a loud clacking noise, masks could open up to then display a different character, or mouths could be removed and replaced with mouths with additional expressions. So. Very. Cool.\nThese masks were used in different types of ceremonies, and each Native American group might use them in a different way.\nMet Museum\nAnother interesting art form from this area is a Haida button blanket. The Haida artists sewed stylized animal designs and pieces of shell to simple wool blankets brought by European traders. These were worn during ceremonies and other special events. Often, the wearer would have a blanket design that represented his or her clan’s signature animal.\nOf course, that is not all of the art from the Northwest coast! I have chosen a few art forms to highlight, but there is also basketry, pottery, boats, carved objects, and more.\nGet the Full Lesson!\nThis Lesson is in The Curated Connections Library!\nFind the full lesson from this post along with hundreds of other art teaching resources and trainings in the Curated Connections Library.

Woodworking was facilitated by the abundance of easily worked species of trees, especially the giant arborvitae (Thuja plicata, also known as red cedar) and the redwood (Sequoia sempervirens ). The trunks of these trees could be split into planks or hollowed out into canoes, containers, and other useful objects.\nDiscover wood-carving traditions handed down from past generations of the Northwest Coast Indian peoples\nTraditional wood carving of the Northwest Coast Indians.\nEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc. See all videos for this article\nThe peoples of this region were noted for their artistic skill, and many everyday items were decorated in some way. More than most other groups in North America, Northwest Coast visual arts emphasized symmetry, neatness of finish, and embellishment through carving and painting. Traditional carving implements included adzes, mauls, wedges, chisels, drills, and curved knives, all made of stone; sharkskin was used for sanding or polishing wooden items.\nRead More on This Topic\nNative American: The Northwest Coast\nThis culture area is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the east by the Coast Range, the Sierra Nevada, and the Rocky Mountains;...\nAs far south as the Columbia River, wooden boxes were made of red cedar boards that were kerfed—cut nearly through transversely. The wood was steamed at these points until it was flexible enough to shape into the form of a box. Dishes often were hollowed out of pieces of wood, sometimes plain, sometimes in the form of animals or monsters. Other items made of wood included spoons and ladles, canoe bailers, trinket boxes, chamber pots, masks and rattles used in ceremonies, magnificent memorial or totem poles and interior house posts, housefronts and screens, halibut hooks, and even the triggers of animal traps. Sometimes items were made from the horns of mountain goats, bighorn sheep, or elk, which were carved by essentially the same methods as wood. Occasionally sculptures were carved from stone.\nHaida headdress\nHaida headdress, painted wood, swan's down, and abalone, c. 1870; in the Denver Art Museum.\nCourtesy of the Denver Art Museum, Colorado\nArtists in the northern province emphasized low-relief carving accented by painting; their motifs were the hereditary crests of the clans or parts of the crests. Different groups in the northern province expressed themselves in somewhat different styles. Haida art, for instance, tended to be massive and to comprise highly conventionalized balanced elements. In Tsimshian carving and painting, there was an effort to leave no open space in or between the conventionalized motifs; filler elements such as eye designs and miniature figures were used intensively. Tlingit art was slightly less conventionalized, with relatively little use of filler elements.\nHaida argillite carving\nHaida argillite carving, c. 1890, depicting a folktale in which the Bear Mother endures a cesarean birth; in the National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Haye Centre, Smithsonian Institution, New York City.\nCourtesy of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, New York\nIn the Wakashan province, representative art was frankly sculptural, impressionistic, and bold. There was a limited amount of simple geometric design on such things as whalebone clubs and whaling harpoon barbs. Their Coast Salish neighbours used some, but less, representative art, similar if looser in style. On Puget Sound there was little representative art; the abstract painted designs on the canoe boards were unlike anything else in the region. Most traditional Chinook art is represented by just a few angular figures incised on mountain sheephorn bowls. In the southernmost part of the culture area, in northwestern California, art generally focused on geometric patterns incised on elkhorn objects and shells. (See also arts, Native American .)\ntotem poles\nMemorial (totem) poles from different tribes stand in Stanley Park, Vancouver.\n© Alan Kearney/FPG International\nWeaving was also highly developed. The inner bark of red cedar was stripped, and the long ribbonlike strands were woven into mats and baskets, using a checkerwork technique. The same material could be shredded into finely divided flexible hanks, which were twined together to make a slip-on rain cape shaped like a truncated cone. The softer inner bark of yellow cedar was made into robes. Persons of high status wore robes made of or edged with strips of sea otter fur and yarn made of the wool of mountain goats. Salish groups near the Georgia Strait wove robes of mountain goat wool and also of wool from a special breed of shaggy dog. The Chilkat, a Tlingit group, wove robes and basketry, applying various twilling techniques to fabric and basketry alike. Their blankets bore representations of crests in blue, yellow, black, and white.\nKarok twined basket\nKarok twined basket, c. 1890; in the Denver Art Museum.\nCourtesy of the Denver Art Museum, Colorado\nTwined basketry made from long flexible splints split from spruce roots illustrated great technical skill. Baskets so tightly woven as to be waterproof were made for cooking in northern and northwestern California; their contents were boiled by placing hot stones into the soup or potage within the basket. Storage containers, receptacles for valuables large and small, and rain hats were also woven. The Coast Salish specialty was coiled baskets.\nDress patterns of the area were fairly simple, and, although ceremonial garments and some hats could be highly embellished, most clothing was worn for protection from the environment rather than for ostentatious display. Both women and men customarily wore some combination of necklaces, earrings, nose rings, bracelets, and anklets; these were made of various materials, mostly shells, copper, wood, and fur. Some individuals rubbed grease and ochre onto their skin to produce a red colour, often accented with black; tattooing was also practiced. Throughout the region women wore skirts or gowns of buckskin, soft leather, or woven wool or plant fibres. Men’s dress varied from tribe to tribe but was in general quite minimal—most men wore nothing but ornaments on warm days. Men of the northernmost Tlingit and the Kitksan of the upper Skeena wore tailored buckskin breechcloths, leggings, and shirts in cold weather; elsewhere they wore robes of yellow cedar bark or pelts in cold weather and rain capes in downpours.\nNorthwest Coast Indian woman\nTlahleelis, a Northwest Coast Indian woman, probably Kwakiutl, wearing a fringed cloak, c. 1914.\nEdward S. Curtis—Edward S. Curtis Collection/Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. (digital. id. cph cph 3b00207)\nKinship and family life\nWhile groups in the northern province tended to be matrilineal—passing status, property, and education through the maternal line—those in the other three provinces were generally patrilineal. Marriages were usually arranged by parents, who openly wished to see their children rise (or at least not fall) in status. As with up-marrying slaves, members of the middle classes of a group could marry up if they had distinguished themselves in some way; the children of these marriages would inherit the status of the higher-ranking spouse. If the spouse of lower rank was not distinguished in some way, the children would accrue the lower status; as this was generally seen as an undesirable outcome, such matches occurred relatively rarely.\nAn interesting aspect of Northwest Coast culture was the emphasis on teaching children etiquette, moral standards, and other traditions of social import. Every society has processes by which children are taught the behaviour proper to their future roles, but often such teaching is not an overt or deliberate process. On the Northwest Coast, however, particularly northward of the Columbia River, children were instructed formally. This instruction began at an age when children were still in their cradles or toddling, and all elder relatives, particularly grandparents, participated in it. Lessons were often delivered gently and humorously through the telling and retelling of folktales; trickster tales recounting Raven’s exploits were especially entertaining, as his troubles were so obviously the result of his dissolute, lazy, gluttonous, and lecherous personality (see Raven cycle ). Children born to high status were given formal instruction throughout childhood and adolescence. They had to learn not only routine etiquette but also the lengthy traditions by which the rank and privileges of their particular group were validated, including rituals, songs, and formulaic prayers.\nChanges in status were generally marked by public ceremonies. Formal rituals were considered necessary at each of two or three critical stages in a person’s lifetime—birth, a girl’s attainment of puberty (there were no boys’ puberty rites in the area), and death—because at those times the participants in these events might be especially vulnerable or so filled with power that they could inadvertently harm others. A newborn infant was believed to be in danger of harm by supernatural beings; the infant’s parents were simultaneously in danger and potentially dangerous. Mystic forms of vulnerability and volatility also accrued to girls at puberty, to the close kin of a deceased person, and to those who prepared and disposed of the dead. Such perils were avoided by isolating the persons involved—either within a boarded-off cubicle in the house or in a simple structure out in the woods—and by limiting their diet to old dried fish and water. At the conclusion of the isolation period, a formal purification ritual was performed. The intensity of the restrictions varied considerably, not only in different parts of the coast but even within individual houses. Often the pubescent daughter of a chief, for example, was secluded for many months, whereas her low-ranking house sister might have to observe only a few days of confinement.\nOver most of the coast there was a very great fear of the dead. A body was usually removed from the house through some makeshift aperture other than the door and disposed of as rapidly as possible. An exception occurred in the northern province, where bodies of chiefs were placed in state for several days while clan dirges were sung. Disposal of the dead varied. In the northern province, cremation was practiced. In the Wakashan and part of the Coast Salish areas, large wooden coffins were suspended from the branches of tall trees or placed in rock shelters. Other Coast Salish deposited their dead in canoes set up on stakes. In southwestern Oregon and northwest California, interment in the ground was preferred.\nReligion and the performing arts\nThe religions of the Northwest Coast shared several concepts that provided the widespread bases for various kinds of religious activity.\nOne concept was that salmon were supernatural beings who voluntarily assumed piscine form each year in order to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of humankind. On being caught, these spirit-beings returned to their home beneath the sea, where they were reincarnated if their bones or offal were returned to the water. If offended, however, they would refuse to return to the river. Hence, there were numerous specific prohibitions on acts believed to offend them and a number of observances designed to propitiate them, chief of which was the first-salmon ceremony. This rite varied in detail but invariably involved honouring the first salmon of the main fishing season by sprinkling them with eagle down, red ochre, or some other sacred substance, welcoming them in a formal speech, cooking them, and distributing their flesh, or morsels of it, communion-fashion, to all the members of the local group and any guests. The maximal elaboration of this rite occurred in northwestern California in what have been called world-renewal ceremonies; these combined first-salmon rituals, first-fruits observances, and dances in which lineage wealth was displayed. Elsewhere the first-salmon rituals were less elaborate but still important, except among the Tlingit, who did not perform them.\nAnother religious concept was the acquisition of personal power by seeking individual contact with a spirit -being, usually through prayer and a vision. Among Coast Salish all success in life—whether in hunting, woodworking, accumulating wealth, military ventures, or magic—was bestowed by spirit-beings encountered in the vision quest. From these entities each person acquired songs, special regalia, and dances. Collectively, the dances constituted the major ceremonials of the Northwest Coast peoples; known as the spirit dances, they were performed during the winter months.\nIn the Wakashan and northern provinces, it was believed that remote ancestors who had undertaken vision quests had been rewarded with totemic symbols or crests. Displaying these hereditary crests and recounting the traditions of their acquisition formed an important part of potlatches. In the Wakashan area certain ceremonial cycles called for the dramatization of the whole tale of the supernatural encounter, which in some cases included the spirit-being’s possession of and its eventual exorcism from the seeker; such dramas were performed by dancing societies.\nShamanism differed from other acquisitions of supernatural power only in the nature of the power obtained—that is, power to heal the sick through extraction of disease objects or recovery of a strayed soul (see soul loss ). It was commonly believed that some shamans, or medicine men and women, had the power to cause infirmities as well as to cure them. Witchcraft was used to kill others or to make them ill and was believed to be carried out by malicious persons who knew secret rituals for that purpose (see witchcraft: Witchcraft in Africa and the world ).\nLoad Next Page", "Northwest Coast Native Carvings - Cheryl's Trading Post\nNorthwest Coast Carvings\nCarving is an ancient tradition among Northwest Coast Tribes.

Other seafood was; crabs, oysters, clams, mussels, seaweed, fish eggs, and occasionally whale. They also ate berries, cranberries, huckleberries, and salal berries that were dried and stored in oil to keep preserved for the winter. Their water were held in \"bent boxes\" or \"property boxes\". Those boxes were also used for cooking. Another cooking method would be to roast over a fire or in a large pot in the ground that they added very hot rocks to boil the water. The food would then be wrapped in leaves.\nHunting/Fishing\nAs you can tell, the Northwest Coast People had a lot of fishing experience. You may wonder, \"how did they actually catch the fish?\" They used nets and underwater traps as well as bone and wood hooks and harpoons. The fish lines were made from cedar. The People also hunted many things including; black-tailed deer, elk, mountain goat, and bear. They used bows and arrows, snares, and harpoons to kill these wild animals.\nShelter\nThe Northwest Coast People don't live by themselves. There were several families that could add up to 40-60 people in one longhouse that were build from cedar. To decide what room you had, the more power you had, the bigger room you got. The roof was supported by four sturdy interior posts at the four corners. To keep warmth there were no windows and only one small entrance. Inside there were cedar or bulrush mats and a fire in the middle of a room used for heat, light and cooking. The smoke from the fire would exit to the outside from a hole in the center of the roof.\nClothing\nTheir clothing was made from\nbark of cedar tree. No, not the hard gnarled bark on the outside. It’s the soft thin bark underneath of that. The process isn’t the same for yellow and red cedar. For yellow cedar they soak it in cold water and then hot water until soft, then beaten it with a “Bark Beater” which is made from whale bone and had\na handle. After that step they roll the soft cedar between the palms of their hands and their upper leg until it is the right thickness for weaving. On the other hand, red cedar is not soaked. It is just split when dry, then twisted or shredded until soft. All of this hard work turns out in the end to make beautiful cedar bark capes, skirts, rainproof hats, a “Chilkat Blanket, which is worn by a high ranked person. They also wear robes of sea otter and other furs to show power.\nTransportation\nThere was only one main source of transportation. Canoes. They were made from cedar trees and some of them could hold 30 or more people!\nTrade/Economy\nThere was a lot of trade in the Northwest Coast. In fact, trading happened for 10000 years.

A loss prevention expert said that retailers might not report every minor theft incident in order to maintain a good relationship with local police.\n“We don’t have any policies in place to hold or bundle shoplifting charges until they reach a felony level,” a Target spokesperson said in a statement.\nVisit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories.\nAt a Target in Las Vegas, the store’s approach to shoplifting has caused one former employee to speak out.\nIsaiah Arellano, a former Target employee who worked at a North Dakota Target location in 2016, and transferred to a Las Vegas location in 2018, recently went viral on TikTok for his video explaining how Target addresses its shoplifters.\n“They will continue letting you steal, all the while they’re documenting the value amount of every single item that you are stealing,” said Arellano in the video. “They will wait until it reaches or exceeds the amount that makes it grand theft larceny, which is an actual felony.”\nThe parameters that classify the degree of a theft charge vary across different states. For example, in Nevada, the stolen property must exceed $1,200 in value for the charge to go from misdemeanor to felony. In general, to be charged with grand theft or larceny, a person must be suspected of stealing more than what would constitute a charge of petty theft, a more minor theft charge with less serious repercussions.\nArellano’s video was a response to another TikTok from influencer Dessy Joseph. In her original video, Joseph described Target’s policy of monitoring repeat shoplifters and waiting for them to accumulate a higher value of stolen merchandise before taking action against them. In Arellano’s video, he says, “She is 100% telling the truth.”  His TikTok has racked up more than 8 million views since it was posted on November 27. Arellano has over 28,000 followers.\nArrellano told Business Insider he felt confident speaking out about this after working in two different Target locations and seeing how they operated.\n“If we saw somebody acting suspicious, it wasn’t up to us to confront them,” he said.\nIn a statement to Business Insider, a Target spokesperson said the company does not “bundle” charges until they reach a felony-level and would not provide details about the company’s procedures for handling theft.\n“We don’t have any policies in place to hold or bundle shoplifting charges until they reach a felony level,” a Target spokesperson said in a statement.\n“At Target, we prioritize the safety and well-being of our guests, team members and the communities we serve,” the statement continued. “Like most retailers, we have security practices, training, and technology in place to address shoplifting in our stores.”\nHowever, according to at the six other former and current Target employees Business Insider spoke to across Minnesota, Michigan, Virginia, New York, and California, the claims in the video are based on actual store policies.\nTarget headquarters monitors crime\nTarget’s “asset protection team members,” or the retailer’s in-store security team, are responsible for monitoring and preventing theft in stores. According to a former employee who worked in asset protection in a Minnesota store until July, shoplifting is usually addressed right away in the store unless the situation is deemed too dangerous.\nHowever, this employee added that there are instances where Target might decline to apprehend a shoplifter because of a general strategy the retailer has when it comes to tracking theft.\n“Headquarters tracks the people who are impacting the stores the most,” this former Minnesota Target employee told Business Insider in an email interview. “Sometimes we are told to only collect information but do not apprehend. This is because a Target Investigator is working with law enforcement to press charges and get these people arrested for a long time.”\nThe reason for this, this former employee said, is to put a stop to the high-volume shoplifters who are a serious threat to the store. If such individuals are only arrested on minor charges, they’ll likely return and continue to steal.\n“The people that Target waits to build a case on are not your run of the mill shoplifter; these are professional thieves,” the former Minnosota employee said, relating his own experience of seeing the same person sent to jail for minor thefts multiple times, only to see him continue to steal.\n“Most of the people get cited and released,”  he said. “These high impact people do not care if they get arrested.”\nA current employee in a New York Target said the asset protection employees often track Target’s “career shoplifters” and “have a binder full of people” with evidence of theft.\nThese employees, like most that were interviewed for this story, were granted anonymity in order to speak more frankly about the policies at Target.\nMaintaining a relationship with police\nWith online marketplaces allowing criminals to surreptitiously unload a high volume of stolen goods online, organized theft has lately become more common in a retail setting, explained Jason Brewer, the executive vice president of communications for the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA).\n“This trend has accelerated during COVID, and stores are often dealing with more brazen, and sometimes violent attempts at stealing mass quantities of merchandise,” Brewer said. “Loss prevention tactics and strategies are designed to mitigate this alarming trend, and protect employees and customers.”\nGeneral practices in loss prevention suggest that documenting theft and waiting to apprehend may have something to do with maintaining a positive relationship with local police.\nWhen operating a big-box store, building a relationship with local police is essential, explained retail loss prevention and security expert John Hassard. While some police departments might be happy to prosecute every instance of theft across the spectrum, many police departments are often swamped with heavier crimes. According to Hassard, it is up to a retailer to determine which crimes are worthy of a call to the police to ensure that justice is able to be maintained in the most efficient way.\n“It’s not typical to call the police in retail when you’ve suffered a loss and you don’t have a person,” said Hassard, explaining why a retailer might undergo a process of documenting and tracking multiple thefts from one individual.\nHassard, who has close to 30 years of experience in loss prevention, said it is up to the retailer to determine how they will go about prosecuting criminal activity in its stores — and if and when it is the right time to call the police.\n“There are retailers that say, ‘We won’t call a police if we catch a shoplifter who has below X amount of dollars,'” he explained. This can change depending on the retailer and location of the store.\nAP\nTracking employees\nAccording to at least three former and current Target employees, Target also tracks shoplifting among its employees and will often wait to apprehend employees who are stealing.\n“Target watches employees for theft more than they do customers,” said a former Target employee who left his job in April of 2018 after 17 years at Target. “They’re easier targets and a lot less risk.”\nA former Target employee in Virginia who left his job in early 2018 said he witnessed management track an employee who was stealing in 2017. In this case, he said, the store manager was aware of a co-worker who was pilfering items from the storeroom for about six months.\n“Seemingly out of nowhere he was arrested at work under the accusation of grand larceny,” the former Target employee said. The asset protection leader later told this employee the store had been documenting every stolen item and collecting security footage for months, he said.\nIn the Las Vegas Target where Arrellano worked he experienced the same thing, he said.\n‘Let them build their own case up’\nAs a cashier, Arrellano was instructed not to intervene in suspected thefts and instead notify asset protection over the radio, he said. As an employee at the in-store Starbucks, Arrellano was privy to the stories and “work gossip” from the asset protection workers who stopped by the coffee shop.\nIn his conversations with asset protection employees, Arrellano learned that the philosophy was to “Let them build their own case up,” and wait for multiple documented cases against a shoplifter.\n“It was a lot more worth their time if they could prosecute for thousands versus a hundred dollars,” he said.\nThe policy felt “strange,” to Arellano, but he felt that he couldn’t say anything while working at Target. “I didn’t think it was right. Luckily they didn’t make me sign an NDA,” he said.\nOriginal Source\nDecember 2020\nM\nT\nW\nT\nF\nS\nS\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31", "Why Target Is the Worst Store to Shoplift From - PayPath\nWhy Target Is the Worst Store to Shoplift From\nDan  Kahan\nJanuary 29 | 2020\nTarget\nDespite the fact that late-stage capitalism is an amoral hellhole driven by a borderline religious belief in the sanctity of brands, we would never, ever suggest that anyone should shoplift from big-box stores, or even imply that doing so is a victimless crime and morally fine.\nBut hypothetically, if we were to give any tidbit of advice to any would-be shoplifters (aside from the Golden Rule that you never, ever steal from mom-and-pop shops or individuals just trying to make a living), it would be this: Avoid shoplifting from Target.\nWhile loss prevention technology has certainly ramped up over the past decade, the truth is that the vast majority of one-off shoplifters don't get caught. The majority of shoplifters who eventually get apprehended are \"the clunky ones who get just good enough to evade detection for a while until they get too greedy and too braggy,\" as Target manager Dan Holliday explains.\nBy nature, working as a loss prevention officer (LP) is one of the most dangerous retail-related jobs a person can have. Every customer apprehension poses the potential risk of the situation turning violent, which is why the vast majority of stores implement \"No Touch\" policies for their LPs, whereby LPs are not allowed to get physical with, and sometimes even not allowed to pursue, suspects. Moreover, even if an LP suspects a person of shoplifting, stopping a customer without solid proof can open the store up to a lawsuit (especially if the customer is innocent).\nBut unlike Walmart and Best Buy, whose loss prevention officers (LPs) barely get paid enough to care––let alone risk their own safety––Target takes loss prevention very seriously. In fact, Target runs one of country's top-rated forensic laboratories, which specializes in solving \"organized retail crimes committed at Target stores through video and image analysis, latent fingerprint and computer forensics.\"\nRetail Stores Sales, Newport, USA - 23 Nov 2018 John Minchillo/AP/REX/Shuttersto\nScarier, though, is the methodical way in which Target goes about building cases against repeat shoplifters. In a 2016 Reddit post, a user named StiggyPop recounted his experience of being a drug-addict who made money by stealing and flipping Blu-Rays from Target. After four months, he was apprehended by a team of high-level LPs who knew everything about him, from where his apartment was located to the specific store he used as a fence (a middleman for stolen goods who acts as a \"fence\" between thieves and unknowing buyers).\nOther Reddit users shared similar stories. As it turns out, alongside their forensic team and top-of-the-line, in-store facial recognition technology, Target is known for actually letting shoplifters get away with their bounty...up until they reach the monetary threshold for a felony shoplifting charge. This means that while a Walmart LP will stop a shoplifter regardless of whether they're stealing a $5 DVD or a $500 dollar TV, Target might allow a shoplifter to steal 100 $5 DVDs over time, all while building up a massive, fool-proof felony case against them. And here's the craziest part––they organize these efforts across stores and even state-lines. Essentially, if you steal at any Target, anywhere in the country, they're quite possibly building up a case against you.\nSo if by chance you have the urge to shoplift, keep yourself safe and avoid Target at all costs. There are plenty of other big-box chains out there that don't deserve your business.\nshoplifting\nFollow Us on\nHow Sinking Funds Can Help You Save For Gift Season\nLKC\nApril 11 | 2022\nWhen people think of gifting, they tend to think of the winter holiday season.\naffiliate\nNo, I Will Not Take Kim Kardashian’s Girlboss Business Advice\nLKC\nMarch 15 | 2022\nKim K is acting up again — nature is healing.\nKeep reading\nkim kardashian\nFemale Founded Brands to Support During Women’s History Month\nPaypath\nMarch 06 | 2022\nOh, how far we’ve come!\nWomen’s History Month is here.

According to a former employee who worked in asset protection in a Minnesota store until July, shoplifting is usually addressed right away in the store unless the situation is deemed too dangerous.\nBut this employee added that there were instances where Target might decline to apprehend a shoplifter because of a general strategy the retailer has when it comes to tracking theft.\n\"Headquarters tracks the people who are impacting the stores the most,\" this former Minnesota Target employee told Business Insider in an email interview. \"Sometimes we are told to only collect information but do not apprehend. This is because a Target Investigator is working with law enforcement to press charges and get these people arrested for a long time.\"\nThe reason for this, this former employee said, is to put a stop to the high-volume shoplifters who are a serious threat to the store.\n\"The people that Target waits to build a case on are not your run of the mill shoplifter; these are professional thieves,\" the former Minnesota employee said, adding that he saw the same person sent to jail for minor thefts multiple times, only to see him continue to steal.\n\"Most of the people get cited and released,\" he said. \"These high impact people do not care if they get arrested.\"\nA current employee in a New York Target said the asset-protection employees often track Target's \"career shoplifters\" and \"have a binder full of people\" with evidence of theft.\nThese employees, like most who were interviewed for this story, were granted anonymity in order to speak frankly about the policies at Target.\nMaintaining a relationship with police\nWith criminals able to surreptitiously unload a high volume of stolen goods on online marketplaces, organized theft has lately become more common in a retail setting, said Jason Brewer, the executive vice president of communications for the Retail Industry Leaders Association.\n\"This trend has accelerated during COVID, and stores are often dealing with more brazen, and sometimes violent, attempts at stealing mass quantities of merchandise,\" Brewer said. \"Loss-prevention tactics and strategies are designed to mitigate this alarming trend and protect employees and customers.\"\nGeneral practices in loss prevention suggest that documenting theft and waiting to apprehend may have something to do with maintaining a positive relationship with local police.\nBuilding a relationship with local police is essential for big-box stores, John Hassard, a retail loss-prevention and security expert, said. While some police departments might be happy to prosecute every instance of theft across the spectrum, many police departments are often swamped with heavier crimes. According to Hassard, it is up to a retailer to determine which crimes are worthy of a call to the police to ensure that justice is able to be maintained in the most efficient way.\n\"It's not typical to call the police in retail when you've suffered a loss and you don't have a person,\" Hassard said, adding that a retailer might undergo a process of documenting and tracking multiple thefts from one person.\nHassard, who has nearly 30 years of experience in loss prevention, said it was up to the retailer to determine how they would go about prosecuting criminal activity in its stores — and if and when it was the right time to call the police.\n\"There are retailers that say, 'We won't call a police if we catch a shoplifter who has below X amount of dollars,'\" he said. This can change depending on the retailer and location of the store.\nAP\nTracking employees\nThree former and current Target employees said the store also tracked shoplifting among its employees and would often wait to apprehend employees who are stealing.\n\"Target watches employees for theft more than they do customers,\" a former Target employee who left his job in April of 2018 after 17 years there. \"They're easier targets and a lot less risk.\"\nA former Target employee in Virginia who left his job in 2018 said he witnessed management track an employee who was stealing in 2017. In this case, he said, the store manager was aware of a coworker who was pilfering items from the storeroom for about six months.\n\"Seemingly out of nowhere he was arrested at work under the accusation of grand larceny,\" the former Target employee said. The asset-protection leader later told this employee the store had been documenting every stolen item and collecting security footage for months, he said.\nIn the Las Vegas Target where Arellano worked, he experienced the same thing, he said.\n'Let them build their own case up'\nAs a cashier, Arellano was instructed not to intervene in suspected thefts and instead notify asset protection over the radio, he said. As an employee at the in-store Starbucks, Arellano said he was privy to the stories and \"work gossip\" from the asset-protection workers who stopped by the coffee shop.\nIn his conversations with asset-protection employees, Arellano said he learned that the philosophy was to \"let them build their own case up\" and wait for multiple documented cases against a shoplifter.\n\"It was a lot more worth their time if they could prosecute for thousands versus a hundred dollars,\" he said.\nThe policy felt \"strange\" to Arellano, but he felt he couldn't say anything while working at Target, he said. \"I didn't think it was right. Luckily they didn't make me sign an NDA,\" he said.\nKeep reading\nAdditional comments\nEmail (optional)\nReceive a selection of our best stories daily based on your reading preferences.\nFor you", "Arrested for Retail Fraud from Target — Michigan Criminal Attorneys Blog — May 10, 2017\nAggressive RepresentationProven legal strategies that get the results you need.Get immediate action from trusted attorneys:Criminal Defense Immigration Law\nMichigan Criminal Attorneys Blog\nMay 10, 2017\nArrested for Retail Fraud from Target\nby Hilf & Hilf, PLC\nTarget stores take an aggressive approach to apprehending suspected shoplifters.  The reason for this is to deter shoplifting, reduce losses, and to protect the merchandise.  What specifically does Target do to address retail fraud:\nFirst, Target prosecutes for shoplifting.  There are no warnings.  There is no mercy.   The employees involved with the theft investigation testify in courtrooms, when necessary. Target actively bans people from their stores with no trespassing orders who it suspects of  shoplifting.  Target has a civil law firm seek civil law settlements and judgments for damages.\nSecond, the store employs asset protection/loss prevention personnel that are well trained.  Technology is used to help the loss prevention team, such as closed circuit television, theft detection devices, and store designs to eliminate blind spots.  The loss prevention personnel have specialized training to identify behaviors of shoppers that suggest that they may commit some form of theft.  Target tries to identify known shoplifters so that loss prevention is alerted whenever such a suspect enters the store so that they can be watched closely.\nThird, the sales personnel are also well trained.  They alert loss prevention or management when they see something suspicious.  Dressing rooms are frequently checked.\nFourth, when a person is apprehended on suspicion of retail theft, they are questioned about the incident in an attempt to gain a confession.  Loss prevention, unlike police officers, are not required to provide Miranda rights.  The recovered merchandise is documented.  Videos are preserved.  All of the evidence – the loss prevention reports; the suspect’s statements, store video, photographs of merchandise, etc., are given to the police officers once they respond to the scene.   Target makes it easy for a police officer to file a report.  Target makes it easy for a prosecutor to go forward with a prosecution.\nEven though Target attempts to do a thorough investigation, mistakes sometimes occur.  The fact that the desk for customer service is so close to the exit sometimes is a source for confusion and error.  Not everyone detained or arrested for retail fraud is guilty.\nExperience matters when it comes to the defense of retail fraud cases.  Not every criminal defense lawyer has the knowledge and ability to properly defend retail fraud accusations.\nEven in cases where guilt is apparent, an experienced criminal defense lawyer that specializes in retail fraud cases is a necessity.  The quality of legal representation is often the difference between jail and no jail.  It makes a difference when trying to obtain a charge reduction or a status in the law to keep the offense off your record.\nRetail fraud convictions can have life altering consequences: it can affect your reputation; it can prevent you from obtaining certain jobs and pursuing certain careers; it can effect your ability to obtain loans/grants/assistance.  It can effect your ability to travel.  To individuals that are not United States citizens, it can affect your ability to remain in the United States, or return if you ever leave the country.\nMake the smart decision and hire the right lawyer.  For all retail fraud cases I recommend the services of Attorney Daniel Hilf of the law firm Hilf & Hilf, PLC.\nMay 10, 2017 12:05 pm\n« Previous|Home|Next »", "How does Target handle shoplifters, and what is its policy? - Quora\nHow does Target handle shoplifters, and what is its policy?\nAd by TruthFinder\nHave you ever googled yourself?

They will see you as a good person, not a thief……Hope that helps, Steve", "Target goes high-tech to stop increasingly savvy thieves - The Boston Globe\nTarget goes high-tech to stop increasingly savvy thieves\nTechnology drives Target’s tough-minded antitheft operation\nBy Jenn Abelson Globe Staff, December 10, 2011, 12:50 a.m.\ntarget\nWESTBOROUGH - Suspected of stealing money from registers, the Target employee was being secretly monitored as she scanned in customers’ purchases on a recent morning. But the security specialists watching the cashier were not anywhere near the New York discount store where she works - they were hundreds of miles away in Westborough, conducting the electronic surveillance from a small, windowless room that is home to the Target Investigations Center.\nBehind an unmarked beige door beside racks of women’s sweaters in the Westborough Target, security technicians are on duty 24 hours a day, looking for organized retail thieves, crooked employees, and amateur shoplifters. They survey thousands of high-tech cameras in an effort to thwart increasingly sophisticated fraud at more than 440 of the chain’s stores.\nRead full article\nAdvertisement\nTarget is at the forefront of this type of retail crime fighting. It has opened 14 investigation centers similar to the one in Westborough, as well as two forensics labs to enhance video footage and analyze fingerprints and a command center at the company’s Minneapolis headquarters. The retailer also operates one of the largest and most advanced networks of cameras - a system that automatically sends alerts when shoppers dwell too long in front of merchandise or roam outside stores after closing time.\nThe 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily.\nTarget Corp. and other merchants expect a boost in sales this time of year, but they also anticipate more in-store theft. In 2010, US shops lost $37.1 billion because of criminal activity, compared with $33.5 billion the year before, according to the most recent survey by the National Retail Federation, a Washington, D.C., trade group. At least 40 percent of the fraud occurs during the holiday season, analysts estimate.\n“As traffic goes up in the stores, so does our work,’’ said R.J. Gaites, Target’s investigations center team leader in Westborough. “We are using state-of-the-art equipment to gather as much intelligence as possible, reduce business risks, and take down criminals.’’\nAdvertisement\nTechnological advances have given thieves more ways to steal, making it harder for merchants to stop them. Some create counterfeit cash using home computers and printers. Others employ jamming devices that interfere with the electronic tags attached to expensive or commonly stolen merchandise. Or they design their own UPC bar codes - configured to register absurdly low prices - to place over legitimate labels.\nAnd if criminals manage to get away with the goods, they can easily dispose of merchandise online, where buyers usually don’t know they are participating in an illicit transaction.\nThe Westborough facility is equipped to fight back. For example, it helped catch a Massachusetts man who stuck his own bar codes on boxes of external hard drives for computers - instead of the legitimate price of $100 each, they rang up at just $20. Investigators pieced together the case after inventory counts revealed missing hard drives from Target’s Framingham store and video surveillance showed someone making repeated visits to discretely place fake codes on boxes.\nThe investigative team then used a software program to search for frequent sellers of that specific kind of hard drive on online auction sites, which led them to their suspect. From there, State Police took over and made the arrest.\nBut that one-man bar code operation pales in comparison with the machinations of organized retail crime groups. Sometimes run by drug gangs, such outfits can involve dozens of people who steal large quantities of merchandise at numerous stores and resell them on eBay, Craigslist, and other websites. According to a National Retail Federation report released in June, nearly 95 percent of retailers reported that they were a victim of organized retail crime in the previous 12 months, up 6 percent from the prior year.\nAdvertisement\n“There are high-tech tools being deployed to commit these retail crimes and get away with them. And there are growing numbers of real amateur opportunists,’’ said Joe LaRocca, senior asset protection adviser for the National Retail Federation. “Retailers have been challenged to stay one step ahead.’’\nThe recession also hampered businesses’ efforts to outsmart thieves. When consumers started spending less money, many retailers cut their budgets for what they call “asset protection’’ or “loss prevention.’’ Target, however, devoted more resources to the problem. In addition to opening new investigations centers, the company also dispatched more plainclothes investigators to shops and upgraded its camera system. Workers at the Westborough site can remotely control store cameras - roughly 40 to 60 in each location - to shift angles or zoom in on shady activity. Footage can be e-mailed to law enforcement officials even as crimes are taking place.\nThe value of the center’s work was highlighted earlier this year during an attempted burglary at a Target in Ohio. When a camera alert revealed someone casing the building after 1 a.m., Westborough workers called police in Columbus and stayed on the phone to provide them with the burglar’s location once he broke into the store. They watched live on monitors as police apprehended the would-be thief in the electronics department.\nAdvertisement\n“As cool as the Westborough center is, if you went to Minneapolis to Target’s command center, you’d be blown away,’’ said Kevin Plante, chairman of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts Loss Prevention Committee and manager of US retail loss prevention operations at Staples in Framingham. “It’s the Mecca of loss prevention.’’\nThe Corporate Command Center, or “C3’’ as Target insiders call it, uses cutting-edge technology to assist with crisis preparedness and response, including satellite imagery and remote surveillance of stores and distribution centers. In a separate part of the headquarters, Target maintains a forensics lab that can enhance video and audio footage, and analyze fingerprints faster than some police labs. The discounter even helps law-enforcement authorities examine evidence when they are working cases involving rival merchants.\n“Obviously, we are competitors, but what’s unique about loss prevention is that we work together,’’ said Mike Silveira, vice president of loss prevention at CVS Caremark, which is considering adding facial recognition technology to its advanced camera system.\nJustin Vuylsteke, head of operations at the investigations center in Westborough, said the company encourages collaboration among rivals because most organized retail criminals do not discriminate - they steal from everyone.\nOfficials from competitors such as Walmart Stores Inc., Kohl’s Corp., TJX Cos., and BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc. have visited the Westborough facility in the past year, Vuylsteke said.\nAdvertisement\nInformation flows both ways at Target - sales associates are encouraged to report suspicious activity to an internal company hotline that is monitored by the investigations center. Based on their video observations, Westborough staffers pass on tips and information to employees at individual shops.\nSecurity technicians compile alerts throughout the day and blast them out to stores to keep them aware of ongoing issues. For example, last week, a local man was suspected of stealing electronics from area Targets, so shops were put on notice. Alerts can include physical descriptions, license plate numbers, and the type of merchandise the suspect was scouting.\nThere is usually a lot of activity in the Westborough center during this time of year, but apparently even criminals need an occasional break from the holiday season. For a few minutes recently, the alarms stopped ringing and the phones fell silent. Gaites, the investigative team leader, wasn’t complaining.\n“We like it when it’s quiet in here,’’ he said.\nJenn Abelson can be reached at abelson@globe.com.

The crisis was a watershed moment for most western economies; it signalled the end of the post-Second World War economic boom.\nThe Argument\nThe economic crisis began in March of 1968. A “chronic” US balance-of-payments deficit, exacerbated by an increase in imports from Europe, and a surge in US tourists spending their money overseas caused an increase in dollars heading abroad. This weakened confidence in the dollar, causing inflation. Foreigners, panicked by the weakening dollar, sold dollars and bought gold, causing the “largest goldrush in history”. [1] Johnson had attempted to preempt the economic crisis by proposing a tax increase in 1967. But the legislature had been held up in Congress by conservatives who preferred that Johnson cut domestic spending on his “Great-Society” reforms instead.\n\nIn early 1968, Congress and Johnson reached a compromise. Johnson would cut domestic spending by $6 billion, and Congress agreed his tax increase, but it was too late to avoid the worst impacts of the crisis.\n\nJohnson himself cited the financial crisis of 1968 as a major reason for not escalating the Vietnam war. He said, “budgetary problems were constantly before us as we considered whether we should or could do more in Vietnam”.\n\nHe knew that increased military spending in Vietnam would put more pressure on the dollar and could lead to further weakening. The dollar simply couldn’t support it.\nCounter arguments\nIf Johnson had really wanted to escalate the Vietnam War, he could have made greater spending cuts domestically. He tried to fund the Vietnam War, and his ambition “Great-Society” welfare reforms simultaneously, meaning neither got the budget required to make the policies a success. [2] Had he have made the Vietnam War his sole priority, he would have had significantly more financial resources available.\n\nAlso, Congress permitted exceptions in cases when it restricted funding. For example, the McGovern-Hatfield amendment of 1970 only prohibited funds for certain military activities, including escalating troops. [3] The President had plenty of political space to pursue other military avenues aside from escalating troop numbers.\nProponents\nslide 1 to 2 of 2\nRobert M.

It began with the North Vietnamese army breaking a truce orchestrate by the Pope. It was the year of the Tet Offensive, a military operation by the North, which drastically reduced many American’s faith that the war was winnable. It was also the year of many iconic moments. The picture of the South Vietnamese officer executing a Vietcong prisoner was taken this year, as was the call by Walter Cronkite to end the war because he considered it unwinnable.\nIn the middle of all this, the U.S. spent a record $77.4 billion dollars on the war in 1968 alone. Johnson would ask congress to pass additional taxes to cover the cost of ramping up military operations and the cost in terms of human lives was a staggering 16,592 Americans as well as 200,000 communist troops and civilians killed.\nFurther Reading\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_in_the_Vietnam_War\nApproved by eNotes Editorial Team\nLatest answer posted August 12, 2011 at 9:04:33 AM\nLatest answer posted October 17, 2015 at 7:33:58 PM", "1968 in the Vietnam War | owlapps\n1968 in the Vietnam War\nThe year 1968 saw major developments in the Vietnam War. The military operations started with an attack on a US base by the North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Viet Cong (VC) on January 1, ending a truce declared by the Pope and agreed upon by all sides. At the end of January, the PAVN and VC launched the Tet Offensive.\nHanoi erred monumentally in its certainty that the offensive would trigger a supportive uprising of the population. PAVN/VC troops throughout the South, from Hue to the Mekong Delta, attacked in force for the first time in the war, but to devastating cost as the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and American troops killed close to 37,000 of the ill-supported enemy in less than a month for losses of 3,700 and 7,600 respectively. These reversals on the battlefield (the VC would never again fight effectively as a cohesive force) failed to register on the American home front, however and fueled what would ultimately prove to be a propaganda victory for Hanoi.\nU.S. troop numbers peaked in 1968 with President Johnson approving an increased maximum number of U.S. troops in Vietnam at 549,500. The year was the most expensive in the Vietnam War with the American spending US$77.4 billion (US$ 576 billion in 2022) on the war. The year also became the deadliest of the Vietnam War for America and its allies with 27,915 ARVN soldiers killed and the Americans suffering 16,592 killed compared to around two hundred thousand PAVN/VC killed. The deadliest  day of the Vietnam War for the U.S. was 31 January at the start of the Tet Offensive when 246 Americans were killed in action.\nJanuary\n1-2 January\nThe PAVN violated the New Year's truce in the New Year's Day Battle of 1968. Among the Americans fighting were future writer Larry Heinemann and future film director Oliver Stone. The PAVN lost 328 killed, while U.S. losses were 23 killed.\nIn Newsweek magazine Robert Komer touted the early success of the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS) pacification program he led.

Wheeler gave the impression that General Westmoreland needed the entire 205,000 troops simply to repel another PAVN/VC offensive and\nregain lost ground in South Vietnam. Wheeler portrayed the Tet Offensive as coming close to success in many places, with the Allies’ victory margin \"very very small indeed.\" He predicted that the PAVN/VC would renew the attack with even greater force. The South Vietnamese forces had held together under the first assault and recouped many of their losses. However, their staying power against a renewed offensive was uncertain. Westmoreland's US forces were in good shape and fighting well, but they were stretched thin and \"he does not have a theater reserve.\" Under these circumstances, \"If the enemy synchronizes his\nexpected major attacks with increased pressure throughout the country, General Westmoreland’s margin will be paper thin.\" The only alternative to the requested reinforcements, would be a decision \"to be prepared to give up areas in lieu of more troops,\" specifically \"the 2 northern provinces of South Vietnam.\" Wheeler's report was a staggering blow to a politically beleaguered administration already shaken by Tet. Johnson and his advisers were dismayed by Wheeler's gloomy assessment of the Vietnam situation, which was in sharp contrast to the more reassuring reports they had been receiving from Westmoreland and Ambassador Bunker.

Inflation is a situation where money loses some of its purchasing power. The United States government uses an economic measurement known as the Consumer Price Index to measure changes in prices for common consumer products.

Use the chart if needed.  What year saw the greatest increase in the adjusted CPI? What might account for the greater increases in adjusted CPI in the late 1960s compared to the mid-1960s? Why might inflation be bad for American consumers?\nAdvertisement\nAnswer\n3.7 /5\n2\ncouplekisssheer\n1. What year saw the greatest increase in the adjusted CPI?\nThe adjusted CPI had its largest increase in 1973, having an 11.04% rate of inflation.\n2. What might account for the greater increases in adjusted CPI in the late 1960s compared to the mid-1960s?\nThe late 1960's increase in inflation was due to the increase of taxes, increase the issuance of currency and cutting public expenditures, in the Lyndon B Johnson government, in order they could meet the military expenses they where having at that moment thanks to the Vietnam war.\n3 - Why might inflation be bad for American consumers?\nIf there is an increase in inflation but not in salary, the amount of earnings will not be powerful enough overtime, which means American consumers would be needing more money to satisfy their daily requirements.\n1970\nIncreased involvement in the Vietnam War, Great Society programs fully in effect.\nConsumers lose purchasing power with inflation forcing them to buy less.\nAdvertisement\nAnswer\n5.0 /5\n11\nschoolingschoolers\n1970\nIncreased involvement in the Vietnam War, Great Society programs fully in effect.\nConsumers lose purchasing power with inflation forcing them to buy less.\nAdvertisement\nSurvey", "Inflation in the 60's\nInflation in the 60's\nIn the early years of the 1960s, prices were relatively stable, rising at a very slow rate.  Between 1960 and 1965, the Consumer Price Index, a measure of the general price level, rose 6.54%, with an average annual percent increase of approximately 1.14%.  This was particularly remarkable in light of the fact that the Kennedy Administration and early Johnson Administration had implemented policies which were designed to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment.  Economic planners generally have to make a trade-off between maintaining low unemployment and low inflation.  The Council of Economic Advisors, under Walter Heller, constructed a plan to maintain a healthy level of growth within controlled parameters that limited inflation.  A stimulative tax cut was proposed, and then successfully implemented.  In addition, the Federal Reserve resolved to maintain low interest rates, and the Kennedy Administration put pressure on industry and unions to keep price and wage increases to a minimum to ensure that there would be no upward pressure on the general price level.  Thus, until 1965, the American economy was growing, the unemployment rate was falling, and there was almost no inflation.\nBeginning in 1965, however, the general price level began to rise at an increasing rate.  The CPI rose 23.07% from 1965 to 1970, with an annual percent increase of about 4.25%.  While industrial production continued to rise and unemployment continued to fall, the economy came under severe pressure.  The rapidly increasing general price level was unpopular, and eroded the incomes of the elderly and other Americans living on fixed incomes.  High inflation also discouraged people from saving money, and increased the pressure on the dollar, which was already in a precarious position because of its role in the international monetary system.  An increase in the demand for loans for defense contractors led the Federal Reserve to raise the discount rate from 4 to 4.5%.\nThe major disruption to the delicate balance achieved in the first half of the decade was the war in Vietnam.  In July of 1965, President Johnson committed American forces to Vietnam.  Wars generally bring about inflation, but the unrelieved financial demands of the war became a serious burden on the economy.  The Defense Department estimated U.S. expenditures in support of obligations in Southeast Asia as $103 million in 1965, $5.8 billion in 1966, $20.1 billion in 1967, $26.5 billion in 1968, and $28.8 billion in 1969.  Johnson did not want to consider it an all-out war, so he was reluctant to request that Congress pass a tax to finance the war.  For two years, he held back, thus blowing a growing hole in the federal budget.  Johnson's desire to maintain the Great Society domestic programs while fighting the war in Vietnam contributed further to federal debt.  The production requirements which the war effort necessitated also pushed the economy beyond the careful constraints the Council of Economic Advisors had suggested to promote non-inflationary growth.\nBy 1966, the government wage and price controls were breaking down.  This, combined with rising interest rates signaled the end of non-taxationary solutions to control inflation.  After an economically painful 1966, Johnson was forced to overcome his resistance to taxes.  On January 10, 1967, in his State of the Union Address, Johnson said, \"I recommend to the Congress a surcharge of 6 percent on both corporate and individual income taxes—to last for 2 years or for so long as the unusual expenditures associated with our efforts in Vietnam continue.\"  Congress did not pass the tax until 1968, at which point the legislation levying a tax also required a reduction in government expenditures.  On June 28, 1968, Johnson signed the Revenue and Expenditure Control Act into law, with its $10 billion tax increase and a $6 billion spending reduction.  Many Great Society supporters were concerned that the spending reduction would threaten domestic social programs.  Nevertheless, Congress was unable to cut the full $6 billion from the budget, and the fiscal 1969 budget ended up with a $3.2 billion surplus and intact Great Society programs.\nAlong with the American failures in Vietnam, the inflation of the late 1960s was a major factor in the breakdown of the Johnson Administration.  Beyond its actual economic effects, it contributed to a general discontent with Johnson and his policies.  In addition, the \"Great Inflation\" proved difficult to eradicate, continuing to plague the American economy into the 1970s, and defying control until 1982.\nPercent Change of Consumer Price Index (1960-1970)\nYEAR    CPI (1967=100)    % change from previous year\n1960        88.7                        —\n1961        89.6                        1.01\n1962        90.6                        1.12\n1963        91.7                        1.21\n1964        92.9                        1.30\n1965        94.5                        1.72\n1966        97.2                        2.86\n1967        100.0                      2.88\n1968        104.2                      4.20\n1969        109.8                      5.37\n1970        116.3                      5.92", "The Forgotten Economic Crisis of '68 | Wilson Quarterly\nThe Forgotten Economic Crisis of '68\n\"The Economic Crisis of 1968 and the Waning of the 'American Century'\" by Robert M.

Collins, in American Historical Review (Apr. 1996), 914 Atwater, Bloomington, Ind. 47401.\nThere have been many accounts of the 1960s, and of the tumultuous year 1968 in par- ticular, but strangely missing from most of them, writes Collins, a historian at the University of Missouri at Columbia, is \"the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression.\" The crisis of 1968 \"marked the beginning of the end of America's postwar eco- nomic boom,\" he argues, and helped persuade President Lyndon B. Johnson to cap escalation of the Vietnam War and curtail the Great Society.\nThe crisis-which culminated in March in a speculative run on gold (\"the largest gold rush in history,\" Time called it in a cover story)-was brought on by a combination of factors, Collins says. The \"most deeply rooted one was chron- ic U.S. balance-of-payments deficits. The caus- es: increased spending overseas, both by American tourists and a U.S. government vig- orously prosecuting the Cold War, as well as increased imports from an economically resur- gent Europe. The deficits produced a glut of dollars abroad, weakening other nations' confi- dence in the dollar; (The dollar was then tied to the gold standard, while other nations' curren- cies were tied to the dollar.)\nThe Johnson administration's massive expenditures on the Vietnam War seriously aggravated the balance-of-payments problem and also fueled inflation. LBJ received advice as early as December 1965 from Gardner Ackley, chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers, to increase individual and corporate income taxes in order to cool down the economy. But Johnson-fearing this would play into the hands of war critics and spell the end of his Great Society-resisted for a year and a half. Finally, in August 1967, he called for a major tax hike, only to see the bill held hostage in Congress by fiscal conservatives who wanted to trim domestic spending. Inflation worsened.\nAmid rising international concern about America's problems early in 1968, foreigners sold dollars and bought gold. In response, the United States and other nations made certain changes to return the international monetary system to working order, and LBJ and Congress finally agreed on a tax increase-together with a $6 billion spending cut. But the gold crisis weighed on U.S. policymakers. \"These mone- tary and budgetary problems were constantly before us as we considered whether we should or could do more in Vietnam,\" Johnson later wrote. \"It was clear that calling up a large num- ber of troops, sending additional men overseas, and increasing military expenditures would complicate our problems and put greater pres- sure on the dollar.\" That helped him to decide on a different course: expanding South Vietnam's role in its own defense.\nIn any event, the makeshift solution of 1968 ultimately could not conceal the weakness of an international system based on a !gold-backed dollar. The U.S. economy could no longer sup port the burden. After another global monetary crisis, in 1971, Collins notes, President Richard\nM. Nixon \"closed the gold window.\" No longer would the dollar be convertible to gold. By 1973, a new system based on floating exchange rates was in place, and the dollar was reduced to the role of first among equals in the world.", "Economic Impact - The Impact Of The Vietnam War\nThe Economic Impact.\nThe Vietnam War cost the United States 58,000 lives and 350,000 casualties. It also had several effects on the U.S. economy. The requirements of the war effort strained the nation's production capacities, leading to imbalances in the industrial sector. Factories that would have been producing consumer goods were being used to make items from the military, causing controversy over the government's handling of economic policy. In addition, the government's military spending caused several problems for the American economy. The funds were going overseas, which contributed to an imbalance in the balance of payments and a weak dollar, since no corresponding funds were returning to the country. In addition, military expenditures, combined with domestic social spending, created budget deficits which fueled inflation. Anti-war sentiments and dissatisfaction with government further eroded consumer confidence. Interest rates rose, restricting the amount of capital available for businesses and consumers. Despite the success of many Kennedy and Johnson economic policies, the Vietnam War was an important factor in bringing down the American economy from the growth and affluence of the early 1960s to the economic crises of the 1970s.\nhttp://www.historycentral.com/sixty/Economics/Vietnam.html\nVietnam Economy\nBefore the US-Vietnam war (1959-1975), Vietnam had a highly centralized economy based on Marxist economic planning. After the war, Vietnam adopted a broad economic trend called 'Doi Moi' (Renovation) to recover from the ravages of the war, the loss of financial support from the Old Soviet Bloc. Later in 1986, the Communist regime changed its economic policy and moved towards the reform of the private sector similar to that seen in China. Since then Vietnam economy has improved, visible in its GDP growth that grew at the rate of 8 % annually from 1990 to 1997.The trend continued from 2000-2002 at a rate of 7 percent. All this led to changes in the Vietnam economy and made it the world's fastest growing economy. It also resulted in between one and two million Vietnamese deaths.\nhttp://www.asiarooms.com/en/travel-guide/vietnam/vietnam-overview/vietnam-politics-and-economy.html", "The U.S. Economy in the Wake of the Economic Crisis of 1957-61  – A Critique of Crisis Theory\nThe U.S. Economy in the Wake of the Economic Crisis of 1957-61\nThanks to the economic crisis of 1957-61, the U.S. economy entered the decade of the 1960s with high levels of unemployment and excess capacity. The millions of unemployed workers and idle plants and machines meant that industrial production could increase rapidly in response to rising demand.\nSince supply was increasing almost as fast as demand, prices rose very slowly. At least according to the official U.S. producer price index, prices hardly changed between 1960 and 1964.\nAs is typical of the phase of average prosperity of the industrial cycle, long-term interest rates rose very slowly. Still, at around 4 percent or slightly higher they had risen significantly since the Korean War days. Back then, the Truman administration still expected to borrow money long term at less than 2.5 percent. Slowly but surely long-term interest rates were eating into the profit of enterprise.\nThe 1960s economic boom begins\nDuring most of the early 1960s, the U.S. economy was passing through the phase of average prosperity that precedes the boom. But starting in 1965, the industrial cycle entered the boom phase proper.\nThe transition from average prosperity to boom is part of the industrial cycle. However, in the mid-1960s this transition was helped along by government economic policies. These were, first, the Kennedy-Johnson tax cut of 1964 combined with the rapid escalation the war against Vietnam. After remaining virtually unchanged through 1964, the official U.S. producer price index suddenly surged 3.5 percent in 1965. That was the year the escalation of the Vietnam War began in earnest.\nBoom and inflation\nThe Vietnam War was far too small a war—from the perspective of the United States, not Vietnam, whose economy was set back by decades—to lead to the contracted reproduction of a full-scale war economy. However, the war did mean that a growing portion of the industrial capacity and labor power of the U.S. economy had to be devoted to meet the needs of the war against Vietnam and the other Indochinese peoples. This was on top of the already high level of “cold war” military expenditures.\nWhen added to the effects of the the Kennedy-Johnson tax cut, the result was that U.S. industry had less excess capacity and unemployed labor power than at any time since the war against the Korean people in the early 1950s. From 1965 onward, U.S. industry could no longer increase production as fast as demand was growing at the existing price level. When this happens in a capitalist economy, demand is reduced to supply through a rise in prices. The boom of the 1960s was on!\nIt is important to realize that the rise in prices in the mid-1960s was a rise in prices in terms of gold, not just dollars. These price rises did not reflect any depreciation of the U.S. dollar against gold. The Bretton Woods international dollar-gold exchange standard was still in effect.\nIndeed, in order to strengthen the dollar-gold exchange standard, the United States and its West European satellites had set up the London Gold Pool. The gold pool was a fund of gold bullion whose specific purpose was to keep the dollar price of gold from rising above $35.20 an ounce. Or what comes to exactly the same thing, to prevent the U.S. dollar from depreciating against gold.\nThe London Gold Pool\nShortly after the Kennedy administration took office, Under Secretary of Treasury Robert Roosa proposed that the United States and the West European central banks prevent the dollar price of gold bullion on the open market from rising above $35.20. That is, whenever the free market price of bullion threatened to hit $35.20 the United States and the West European central banks would sell gold. If the price of bullion fell below $35 an ounce, they would buy gold.\nAccording to Roosa’s “suggestions,” the gold pool would be made up of the United States, Britain, West Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. (1) Essentially, this meant that the dollar would now be backed not only by the gold in Fort Knox but also by the gold of Britain, West Germany, France and the other members of the gold pool. Or what comes to exactly the same thing, America said to its European imperialist satellites, from now on your gold reserves will backing our currency. This is a good example of the nature of the “world order” that emerged from World War II!\nHeyday of Keynesian economics\nThe 1960s were the heyday of Keynesian economics. Both presidents Kennedy and Johnson were surrounded by economists of the Keynesian school. According to the Keynesian analysis, the U.S. economy in 1965-66 was in a state of inflation. Remember, according to Keynes if the rate of interest is below the rate of profit—to use Marxist terminology—at “full employment,” industry will not be able to expand production in the “short-run.” (2)\nThat is, the industrial capitalists will be unable to expand production without undertaking major capital investments that will expand industry’s physical ability to produce. That, however, takes time. Therefore, any further increase in monetarily effective demand cannot be satisfied at the existing price level. If demand keeps growing anyway—which according to the Keynesian analysis it will as long as the long-term rate of interest remains below the rate of profit, prices will have to rise to reduce monetarily effective demand to supply.\nThe Keynesian answer to this problem is to raise long-term interest rates. The central bank has much more influence on short-term interest rates, such as what is called in the United States the federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans that commercial banks grant one another. (3)\nFor example, if a commercial bank finds itself short of reserves—deposits with its district Federal Reserve Bank plus vault cash—it borrows money very short-term from another commercial bank. In the United States, the rate of interest it pays is called the federal funds rate. If the Federal Reserve System nudges up the federal funds rate—by selling some of its portfolio of Treasury notes—the money market is tightened and long-term interest rates rise as well, though to a lesser extent.\nAnother possible answer to the problem of inflation, according to Keynesian theory, is a restrictive fiscal policy. The central government should if possible reduce its expenditures—or at least reduce their rate of growth, raise taxes and balance its budget. If the government runs a surplus while the central bank is “tightening,” demand is removed from the economy. With the “excess” demand removed, the Keynesian economists claim, supply will then be able to keep up with demand at current prices. The Keynesians boasted that their “tools” could deal not only with a shortage of demand—recession or stagnation—but an excess of demand—inflation as well.\nIn the 1965-66 period, however, a restrictive—sometimes called a deflationary fiscal policy—was out of the question for the Democratic administration of Lyndon B. Johnson. The administration had just convinced Congress to pass a huge regressive tax cut in 1964 in order to deal with the problem of high excess capacity and unemployment—caused by insufficient monetarily effective demand—that had affected the U.S. economy in the early 1960s. How could it turn around now and ask for a tax increase only a year or two later?\nIn addition, the administration was faced with a growing anti-war movement—unlike during the war against Korea, not to speak of World War II—and major unrest in the inner cities, especially among working-class African American youth. The last thing the administration wanted to do was to ask the American people to actually pay for the war in the form of higher taxes.\nThe credit crunch of 1966\nIn the light of this reality, the entire burden of slowing the inflationary boom fell on the Federal Reserve System. In 1966, the Federal Reserve Board moved to tighten credit. On Jan 19, 1966, the “fed funds” rate fell to 1.50 percent. But between September 9 and 11, the fed funds rate hit 6.13 percent, an extremely high level by pre-1968 standards.\nThis abrupt tightening of the money market led to a sudden freeze up of credit. It was the collision between the demands for credit by the federal, state and local governments, consumers, industrial capitalists and commercial capitalists that drove the federal funds rate up so abruptly. Or what comes to exactly the same thing, the demand for credit exceeded the supply of credit at current interest rates.\nThe U.S. federal government has the highest credit rating in the world. In a credit-crunch—a situation where the demand for credit exceeds the supply—like that of 1966, the U.S. government can always get credit even if at somewhat higher interest rates than before. But credit becomes unavailable or it is available only at extravagant interest rates to all but the most creditworthy borrowers such as the strongest—that is the richest—corporations.\nFrom credit crunch to mini-recession\nWith credit drying up, the U.S. economy entered into the so-called mini-recession of 1966-67. While in the United States, the National Bureau of Economic Research refused to declare the 1966-67 episode a “contraction,”  the economy of West Germany experienced its biggest recession since resuming growth after World War II. (4)\nThe Johnson administration and the Fed, fearing a major economic crisis, took fright, and The Fed quickly reversed its tight money policy. The last thing the beleaguered administration of Lyndon B. Johnson wanted was a recession on top of its other problems!\nThe Fed moved quickly to ease the money market by purchasing Treasuries, and the fed funds rate dropped back below 4 percent, falling as low as 3.25 on May 10, 1967. The economy resumed growing though at a lower rate, and while inflation continued, it was lower than it was in 1965, at least as measured by the official producer price index.\nGuided by Keynesian economics, the Fed had apparently succeeded in slowing down the economy sufficiently to dampen inflation without throwing it into a full-scale recession and mass unemployment. (5) Indeed, by their “skillful” monetary policy hadn’t the Fed idled just enough industrial capacity to support the “war effort” against Vietnam while avoiding a really big economic downturn? But as it turned out the victory of Keynesian policies in 1966-67 was a Pyrrhic one.\nThe Tet Offensive and the end of the Bretton Woods dollar-gold exchange international monetary system\nIn January 1968, the Vietnamese resistance fighters launched a a massive offensive—remembered as the Tet Offensive—against the U.S. occupiers and the puppet “South” Vietnamese army. (6) In the countryside and the cities alike, the Vietnamese population rose up against the hated U.S. occupation. The U.S. “embassy” in Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) itself became a battleground.\nBefore the Tet Offensive, the Johnson administration and the U.S. media had claimed that the United States was winning the war against the Vietnamese resistance. Soon the resistance fighters—called the “Viet Cong” by the U.S. media—would be exterminated. (7) Victory was in sight.\nBut the Tet Offensive gave the lie to this, though the Vietnamese resistance fighters did pay a heavy price in terms of dead and wounded, a fact that U.S. histories of the war still gloat over. These pro-war histories claim that the extremely high price that the Vietnamese people were forced to pay in terms of dead and wounded showed that the United States and its South Vietnamese puppet collaborators were the real victors of the battle. What the results of the Tet Offensive really showed was how high a price the Vietnamese people were willing to pay for their freedom.\nIn the wake of Tet, General William Westmoreland, the U.S. commander in Vietnam, requested hundreds of thousands of new troops. Westmoreland assured Johnson that this “troop surge” would finally enable him to crush the Vietnamese resistance once and for all. Like he had always done up to this time, Johnson approved Westmoreland’s request.\nTet and the end of the London Gold Pool\nFrom February 1962. the gold pool was in full operation. Starting in 1965—the year that the United States greatly escalated its war against the people of Vietnam—the gold pool began to lose gold. In 1967, with the war against Vietnam still escalating and the Fed and other central banks again easing credit in order to stave off the threatening economic crisis, the British pound was devalued. However, the final blow to the London Gold Pool was the Tet Offensive followed by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson’s decision to agree to Westmoreland’s proposed “troop surge.”\nBy continuing to sell off their gold reserves to support the U.S. dollar, which they were required to do under the London Gold Pool, the West European imperialist satellites of the United States were, in effect, financing the war against Vietnam—which the Johnson administration had refused to do by raising taxes.\nFinally, in 1967 with the collapse of the gold pool clearly approaching, France under de Gaulle pulled out of the pool. But not West Germany. Hitler’s heirs announced that they would not only remain in the gold pool, they would not be cashing in the dollars that were accumulating in their central bank for gold. The successors of the Third Reich were willing—or forced—to keep financing the U.S. war against Vietnam, not only with their gold bullion but through the devaluation of their dollar reserves once the gold pool finally collapsed.\nBut after all, these heirs of the “thousand-year Reich” that had terrorized all of Europe just a quarter of century before had little choice. They were, after all, an occupied country, and were not—and still are not—permitted to have their own nuclear weapons, unlike France and Britain.\nFrance under de Gaulle retained a little more room for maneuver. France was, after all, a nominal “victor” in the war, and had acquired its own nuclear weapons. So a few months before the gold pool collapsed, they got out. However, it is telling that France stayed in the gold pool as long as she did. The French government and central bankers under de Gaulle had also thrown away French gold to finance the dirty genocidal war against the Vietnamese people.\nOn March 5, 1968, as word spread about the Democratic administration’s latest “troop surge” in Vietnam, the gold pool was forced to dump 100 tons of gold on the market to keep the free market dollar price of gold at or below $35.20. On a “normal day, perhaps five tons would have been dumped on the market. After consultations over that weekend, a special statement was issued: “the London Gold Pool re-affirm their determination to support the pool at a fixed price of $35 per oz.”\nThe chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, William McChesney Martin, declared that the United States was prepared to defend the $35 an ounce gold price “down to the last ingot.” The problem for Johnson, McChesney Martin, and the other war makers in Washington was that the market was more than willing to take that last ingot of gold, and the last ingots of Washington’s West European satellites in the bargain. In a last ditch attempt to save the gold pool, a huge air lift was organized to ferry gold bullion to London to dump on the open market.\nThe London Gold Pool collapses\nOne March 15, 1968, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Roy Jenkins announced that upon “the request of the United States,” the London gold market would be temporarily shut down. The gold pool was dead. During the two weeks that the London gold market was closed, the pool was officially dismantled.\nThe end of the London Gold Pool and a few other things as well\nThe gold pool wasn’t the only thing that came to an end that March. Lyndon B. Johnson was forced to inform General Westmoreland that his decision to grant Westmoreland’s request for hundreds of thousands more U.S. troops to crush the Vietnamese resistance was rescinded. Instead, Johnson was forced to announce that he would open up peace talks with the representative of the Vietnamese people.\nIn addition, Johnson told a nationwide television and radio audience that he would not be a candidate for the Democratic Party nomination for re-election in the upcoming 1968 U.S. presidential race. For all practical purposes, the post-World War II prosperity was over too, though it took a number of years before this became apparent, as we shall see in next week’s post. And though it was not official, the Bretton Woods System was at death’s door. Though the U.S. war against Vietnam was far from over, the way was being prepared for the victory of the Vietnamese people over U.S. imperialism.\nAfter the gold pool\nAfter suspending gold trading in London for two weeks, a so-called two-tier system was set up. The dollar price of gold on the free market would now be set by supply and demand. The central banks and governments, however, could still convert their dollar reserves into gold at the rate of $35 for an ounce. In form, this was a return to the situation that had prevailed in the early years after World War II, when the dollar price of gold bullion on the free market was usually somewhat higher then the official $35 an ounce dollar gold price. Indeed, it wasn’t until the gold pool started operation in February 1962 that Washington and its West European satellites formally promised to keep the free market dollar price of gold between $35.00 and $35.20 an ounce.\nThe U.S. government denied that the dollar had actually been devalued. But in fact the dollar was devalued. After World War II, a free market dollar price of gold significantly above $35 an ounce was viewed as temporary; now there was no real limit on how how much above $35 an ounce gold would be allowed to rise. At the time of this writing, 41 years later, the dollar price of an ounce of gold is about $1,000, a long way from $35!\nAs I explained several weeks ago, the Bretton Woods international monetary system could only work if the free market price of gold did not rise significantly above $35 an ounce. If it did, the central banks would have little choice but to “purchase” gold from the U.S. Treasury at $35 and either hold it in their reserves or sell on the free market for whatever was the going price. If they sold the gold for dollars, they could present even more dollars to the U.S. Treasury demanding one ounce of gold for every $35. The U.S. gold reserve would then melt away like the snow on a hot day in early spring.\nFrom March 1968 to the final end of the dollar-gold exchange standard\nAs I will explain next week, Washington actually took some deflationary measures that temporarily caused the dollar price of gold to fall back to $35 on the open market. So formally speaking, the Bretton Woods dollar-gold exchange system didn’t actually die in March 1968 but rather entered its death agony. But by May 1970, the U.S. domestic money market was close to panic, the stock market was crashing, and the giant Penn Central Railroad went bankrupt—the most significant industrial bankruptcy of the postwar era up to that time. The deflationary actions were quickly reversed, and the dollar price of gold began its relentless rise on the “open market.” The clock was ticking on Bretton Woods.\nGold begins its climb\nIn February 1970, with the deflationary actions that were taken after March 1968 still in effect, the closing dollar price of gold on the London market averaged $34.99, one cent below the par value of $35. If the free market price of gold had stayed at these levels, the Bretton Woods System would have continued to function. But by August 1971, the dollar price of gold exceeded $42 and was rising.\nAt that time, nobody knew how high and, just as important, how rapidly the dollar price of gold would rise—or more properly, how rapidly the dollar would fall against real money—on the “free market,” where the amount of gold that one dollar actually represents at any given instant is determined.\nIn the summer of 1971, with the dollar price of gold now well above $40 an ounce and rising, the central banks—at least the central banks of those countries that retained enough independence within the American empire to make such a request—began to present their dollars to the U.S Treasury, demanding payment in gold bullion for every $35 they presented. The U.S. Treasury faced a full-scale run on its gold reserves.\nThe real cause of the crisis\n“Because of the excess printed dollars,” Wikipedia writes, “and the negative U.S. trade balance, other nations began demanding fulfillment of America’s ‘promise to pay’—That is the redemption of dollars for gold.” Wiki continues:\n“Switzerland redeemed $50 million of paper for gold in July. France, in particular, repeatedly made aggressive demands, and acquired $191 million in gold, further depleting the gold reserves of the U.S. On 5 August 1971, Congress released a report recommending devaluation of the dollar, in an effort to protect the dollar against foreign price-gougers. Still, on 9 August 1971, as the dollar dropped in value against European currencies, Switzerland withdrew the Swiss franc from the Bretton Woods system.”\nThe international gold-dollar exchange system dies\n“To stabilize the economy,” Wiki goes on, “and combat runaway inflation, on August 15, 1971, President Nixon imposed a 90-day wage and price freeze, a 10 per cent import surcharge, and, most importantly, ‘closed the gold window’ [emphasis added—SW], reneging on the promise to exchange gold for dollars.”\nWith due respect to the on-line editors of Wikipedia, I must observe that allowing the dollar to plunge against gold was an odd way of “combating inflation.” More on this next week.\nVarious explanations have been put forward by both Marxists and bourgeois economists for the end of the dollar-gold exchange system—at the time and since. “By the early 1970s,” Wiki explains, “as the costs of the Vietnam War and increased domestic spending accelerated inflation, the U.S. was running a balance of payments deficit and a trade deficit, the first in the 20th century. The year 1970 was the crucial turning point, which, because of foreign arbitrage of the U.S. dollar, caused governmental gold coverage of the paper dollar to decline 33 percentage points, from 55 percent to 22 percent. That, in the view of Neoclassical Economists and the Austrian School [the two main schools of marginalism—SW] represented the point where holders of the U.S. dollar lost faith in the U.S. government’s ability to cut its budget and trade deficits.”\nFrom August 15, 1971, the U.S. dollar ceased to be credit money as far as the central banks and foreign governments were concerned just like it had ceased to be credit money for American citizens in March 1933. The U.S. dollar had become token money pure and simple, both for the person on the street and the ministries of finance and central banks alike. The post-World War II international monetary system based on the dollar-gold exchange standard was dead.\nBut why did the dollar-gold exchange system that had lasted for 31 years after the end of World War II finally die in August 1971 and not some other time? The problem with the “neoclassical and Austrian school explanation” is its superficiality. The immediate cause of the collapse of the dollar-gold exchange standard was that the U.S. Treasury faced a run, much like a bank run where the depositors demand cash in exchange for their deposits. But was the U.S. government in the summer of 1971 really in the position of an insolvent commercial bank? If so, how did America manage to maintain its world empire?\nGrowing economic competition from Europe and Japan\nUp until around 1970 the United States ran a persistent surplus in its balance of trade. As first as Western Europe and then Japan began to recover from the devastating effects of World War II, they needed commodities produced by America’s vast industrial machine to carry out the necessary reconstruction. As the post-World War II prosperity unfolded, the economies of Western Europe, with the exception of Britain, grew consistently faster than did the U.S. economy. The economy of Japan grew faster still. Indeed, the economies of West Germany and Japan grew so rapidly that it became something of a cliché to observe that the two defeated axis powers were economic giants but political midgets.\nI explained in an earlier post that after World War II, in contrast to the post-World War I period, the United States finally opened up its huge home market to the Europeans and Japanese. The U.S. would allow the German and Japanese capitalists to compete economically with the American capitalists but not politically or militarily. This agreement has lasted up until the present.\nIn the first quarter of a century after World War II, the U.S. trade surplus showed a gradual tendency to shrink. Around 1970, it disappeared completely. On the other hand, the huge U.S. military expenditures, necessary to maintain its world empire, meant that the United States ran a balance of payments deficit even when it was still running a surplus in its balance of trade.\nBut the Bretton Woods system actually required such a U.S. deficit. Even when the U.S. trade surplus was large, American capitalists extended credits to the Europeans and Japanese as they rebuilt their economies. The United States ran a huge balance of payments deficit when it came to foreign investment—the U.S. was exporting capital—and the huge expenditures for military operations that the U.S. government carried out abroad, such as the Korean War. That deficit was almost but not quite covered by the U.S. trade surplus and the flow of interest payments and dividends that the U.S. capitalists “earned” on foreign investments.\nIn this way, the quantity of dollars grew in the world economy, and under the Bretton Woods dollar-gold exchange standard, these dollars constituted the primary backing for the local currencies of Western Europe and Japan. Or what comes to exactly the same thing, in the absence of a U.S. balance of payments deficit, the West European and Japanese economies would have faced much the same kind of deflationary pressure that they faced after World War I.\nWhy therefore did the U.S. balance of payments deficits become a source of crisis in 1968 and 1971 when they were a requirement for the Bretton Woods System to function in the first place? Was it simply that the U.S. payments deficits had become too large, or was something else involved? What would have happened if the dollar was the only currency?\nA hypothetical alternative history\nIn my opinion, even if the United States had completely abolished all currencies other than the dollar after World War II, the currency crisis that erupted in 1968 would have occurred anyway. Suppose the U.S. had forced all countries at Bretton Woods to adopt the dollar as their official currency. Or what comes to exactly the same thing, the entire capitalist world have been completely “dollarized”. (8) The foreign central banks would have ceased to be banks of issue, much like the central banks of France, Germany, Italy, Ireland and other countries of the euro zone have ceased to be banks of issue since the adoption of the Euro. But in exchange for this, let’s suppose the U.S. government had promised to redeem dollars that the central banks and governments of other countries held for gold at the rate of $35 an ounce.\nIn this alternative world, there would be no question of devaluing the dollar against other currencies. There would be no other currencies, and the dollar could not of course be devalued against itself. One dollar at any instant in time will always equal one dollar. However, a “London Gold Pool” could still have been organized by the United States and its West European satellites under my assumptions.\nBut what if the private money capitalists had decided at a certain stage that the dollar—the sole currency in the world—was likely to be devalued against gold in the near future. The fictional gold pool, just like the real one, would have been forced to sell more and more gold on the open market to keep the dollar price of gold at or below $35.20.\nThere would be a run on gold, and the fictional London gold pool would still have collapsed—just like the real one did. Like happened in the real world, the capitalist government and central banks would have begun to redeem their dollars for gold at the U.S. Treasury as the dollar price of gold began to rise on the “free market.” This would have forced the U.S. government to break its promise to redeem gold at the rate of one ounce of gold for every $35 presented to it.\nThe only difference would have been that there would be no question of devaluing the dollar against other currencies, or what comes to exactly the same thing, revaluing other currencies against the dollar, since their would be no other currencies.\nWhile the existence of currencies other than the dollar complicates the situation, I believe that in order to understand the crisis of March 1968 and the final crisis of the dollar-gold exchange system that occurred in August 1971 it is best to abstract the existence of currencies other than the dollar.\nIn an article dated December 1968 Ernest Mandel, considered alongside Maurice Dobb and Paul Sweezy to be one of the leading Marxist economists in the capitalist world after World War II, came close to grasping the true nature of the March 1968 crisis:\n“For thirty years … all prices have risen (in paper money) while the price of gold has remained stable.” [That is, prices expressed in terms of gold, the money commodity in whose use value the exchange value of all other commodities are measured, had risen for 30 years. Or as Mandel might have said, the prices of commodities in terms of real money—gold—have been rising since the end of the Depression.—SW] “They forget rather quickly that in the same period there has been a prodigious upsurge in labor productivity in virtually every industrial branch, while nothing equivalent to this has happened in the gold industry. [Emphasis added—SW] … [T]he relationship between gold and other goods [Mandel means commodities, perhaps a bad translation here—SW] has therefore developed strongly in the direction of a drop in value for goods, as expressed in terms of gold.” (“The Crisis of the International Monetary System,” International Socialist Review, March-April 1969)\nIn other words, the general price level of commodities had once again risen above the underlying labor values of those commodities. Just like the situation right after World War I, though not to the same degree, the prices of commodities had risen above their values.\nValue and price\nHowever, the basic economic law that regulates the capitalist economy, the law of value of commodities, does not allow such a situation to persist indefinitely. The law of value of commodities does not state that market prices equal values—or prices of production—at any given point in time. Marx emphasized already in his early work “The Poverty of Philosophy” that on the contrary they almost never do.\nRather, the law of value states that market prices are constantly fluctuating around values—or prices of production—now rising above them, but then compensating by falling below them. During the Depression, market prices had fallen below values—or prices of production—but by 1968 market prices had once again risen well above their values. The law of value dictated that sooner or later market prices—in terms of gold—would once again have to fall below their underlying labor values.\nHow the dollar-gold exchange standard could have been saved\nCould the dollar-gold exchange standard have been saved? Technically not only could this have been done, it would have been quite easy. All that would have been necessary to save the Bretton Woods System would have been for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sufficiently to break the demand for gold by private money capitalists.\nRemember, all things remaining equal, the demand for gold moves inversely to the rate of interest. The higher the rate of interest the lower the demand for gold. In England in Marx’s time, there was a saying that 6 percent could draw gold from the moon.\nDumping gold on the market like the gold pool did could not quench the thirst for gold at the prevailing rate of interest. At the then-prevailing rate of interest, all the gold that then existed in the world would not have been enough. But raising interest rates sufficiently would have depressed the demand for gold by the private money capitalists back to the amount they already held. The run on gold would have been broken.\nThat this is indeed true is shown by the fact that the dollar price of gold did fall back to $35 an ounce when interest rates were raised—prolonging the death agony of the gold-dollar exchange system by more than three additional years.\nThe problem was that a rise in interest rates also meant that the crisis of overproduction that was being held at bay by the “expansionary policies” of the U.S. government and Federal Reserve System—on a global scale the growing U.S. balance of payments deficit being simply a part of the expansionary policy—would break out. However, the deflation and depression that would have followed, though perhaps not as extreme as that the 1930s, would still have been far worse than the economic crisis of 1957-61.\nAnd that is exactly what the U.S. government, already facing a mass movement against the war in Vietnam, rebellions in the working-class Afro-American inner cities, and the general mood of rebellion that characterized the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, feared most of all. What would happen if a major new depression led to the radicalization of the heavy battalions of organized labor? The ghost of the Depression, and the subsequent unionization of basic industry haunted the American—and the world—capitalist class then just as it does even today.\nTherefore, during the international monetary crises of 1968-71 the U.S. government and Federal Reserve System never even considered raising interest rates sufficiently—and for a sufficient period of time—to save the Bretton Woods international dollar-gold exchange standard. Remember, the gospel of the bourgeois economists since the Depression has been that the general price level must never be allowed to fall.\nThe only other possibility was a major devaluation of the U.S. dollar and to varying degrees the other capitalist currencies that were linked to it. (9)\nIf the amount of real money—gold—represented by each dollar has fallen—and this is what is really meant by the economic slang expression “the price of gold has risen”—each individual dollar represents less gold than before. Back in the late 1960s, a dollar meant 1/35th of an ounce of gold; currently it means about 1/1,000th of an ounce of gold.\nNow, if the dollar is devalued against gold—the dollar price of gold is allowed to rise to a greater or lesser degree on the “free market”—and if the prices of commodities in terms of dollars remain unchanged, then prices in terms of gold—real money—will fall.\nKeynes, who had represented Britain at the Bretton Woods conference, had never really liked the Bretton Woods dollar-gold exchange system that emerged from the conference (10) He even proposed a world-wide paper currency that would be administered jointly by the “victorious” imperialist powers. But in reality there was only one victorious imperialist power— the United States—and Keynes was turned down.\nSince at least the 1920s, Keynes had dreamed of a “managed currency” that would finally end the monetary role of gold—or any other commodity money—once and for all. Keynes believed such a monetary “reform”—a reform that Marx demonstrated was impossible under the capitalist mode of production—would enable the “monetary authorities” to drive the rate of long-term interest below the rate of profit no matter how low the rate of profit fell.\nKeynes imagined that with gold “dethroned,” the monetary authorities would be able to create sufficient demand to guarantee “full employment.” He believed this could be done using deficit spending if long-term interest rates fell so close to zero that it would be difficult to lower them further. The threat of “general gluts”—crises of overproduction—which Keynes admitted, in contrast to the “orthodox marginalists,” were possible under the capitalist system—would finally be ended once and for all.\nUnder the old international gold standard, as Keynes saw it, gold had gotten in the way of the “monetary authorities” creating sufficient monetary demand to ensure “full employment.” Instead, the monetary authorities, such as the Bank of England, found their hands tied by their obligation to pay out five gold sovereigns for every five pound banknote that was presented to it. Hence, according to Keynes, the crises.\nTherefore, Keynes believed the gold standard in any form—even in the form of a gold-exchange standard—should be abolished. But Keynes failed to convince the United States authorities of the wisdom of this at Bretton Woods.\nTrue, the Bretton Woods System was designed to be considerably more flexible than the old pre-World War I international gold standard had been. But even under the Bretton Woods System, gold could still get in the way of “expansionary policies.”\nFor example, the gold drain that the United States suffered in the wake of the 1957-58 recession forced the Federal Reserve System to raise interest rates so rapidly in order to save the dollar-gold exchange system that the U.S. economy was thrown into the double-dip recession of 1960-61. It was no coincidence that the right-wing Republican President Richard Nixon declared himself a Keynesian. He believed that the Fed’s “tight money” policy in 1960 had cost him the White House in the 1960 U.S. presidential election.\nBut with Nixon’s decision to finally close the gold window, the Keynesians were convinced that gold would no longer get in the way. The Federal Reserve System and other central banks would now be free to create whatever amount of money was required to maintain the effective demand necessary for full employment. Gold’s long reign was finally over, the managed currency of Keynes’s dreams was at hand! Crisis-free capitalism had arrived.\nThe Keynesians weren’t alone among the bourgeois economists in applauding Nixon’s decision to finally end what remained of the dollar’s convertibility into gold. Another supporter of Nixon’s decision to “close the gold window” was a certain University of Chicago economics professor named Milton Friedman. Professor Friedman had little use for Nixon’s other moves announced on August 15, 1971, such as the wage-price freeze, or the temporary 10 percent tariff. To the end of his days, Friedman complained that Nixon was the most “socialist” president in the history of the United States, even worse than that notorious semi-red Franklin D. Roosevelt! (11)\nBut Friedman did approve of the decision to end the last trace of the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold. According to Friedman, since gold coins had stopped circulating in the United States in 1933, gold was no longer money but simply “another commodity.” Under the dollar-gold exchange standard, the government was “supporting” the price of gold. This was in violation of the most sacred law of the free market, government must not interfere with commodity prices, including the price of gold. Anything else was socialism! Prices, including the dollar price of gold, must be determined only by supply and demand on the free market.\nGold versus ‘monetarism’\nAs long as the U.S. dollar—or other currencies—were still convertible into gold, the need to redeem currencies in gold could get in the way of the steady growth in the money supply that the “monetarist” Friedman held was the key to a crisis-free capitalism. For example, after the 1957-58 recession, the Fed should not have moved to restrict the growth of the “money supply” but was forced to do so by the need to maintain the price of the gold at $35 an ounce. The “socialist” policy had caused the recession of 1960-61, which led to the defeat of the Republican presidential—and future “socialist,” according to Friedman—Richard Nixon.\nNext week I will examine the consequences of the decision to allow the “price of gold” to soar on the free market.\n—————\n1 The U.S. government did not allow occupied Japan to accumulate a significant gold reserve, so Japan was not asked to participate in the gold pool.\n2 Or, to use Keynes’s own terminology, if the rate of interest is below the marginal efficiency of capital at full employment…\n3 Commercial banks often find themselves short of reserves—deposits at the central bank plus vault cash. When this happens, they either have to borrow at the central bank’s discount window—something the commercial banks normally try to avoid because its can raise questions about their solvency—or from other commercial banks. If commercial banks have extra reserves, lending out these reserves for brief periods to other commercial banks that find themselves short of reserves allows them to “earn” interest on funds that would otherwise lie idle.\n4 This is an example of how the NBER reduces the number of recessions. For early decades, where statistical data is limited, the NBER counts as “contractions” any hint of slower than average business activity. But for more recent decades, the NBER only considers business to be in a “contraction” if the evidence for an economic downturn is overwhelming. This enables the ideologues of capital to claim that the capitalist economy is becoming more stable as recessions become less frequent.\n5 That is, an economic slowdown so pronounced that even the NBER would be forced to declare it a “contraction.”\n6 During the Vietnam War, both sides observed ceasefires during the Christmas-New Year’s-Tet holidays. Right after the holiday ceasefire ended in January 1968, the Vietnamese resistance launched the massive uprising that is known as the Tet Offensive.\n7 There was in fact no organization called the “Viet Cong” in Vietnam. The term Viet Cong, meaning Vietnamese Communists, was used by the U.S. government and media and the puppet South Vietnamese government. It is still used by the bourgeois historians and the U.S. media when referring to the “South” Vietnamese resistance in the 1960s and 1970s.\nIn reality, Vietnam, especially “South” Vietnam, was a peasant country where the great majority of the population were peasant small property owners, not proletarians. While there were some Communists in “South” Vietnam, and they of course played a leading role in the resistance, the resistance in Vietnam went far beyond Communists. Only the large landowners, the top layers of the puppet military and bureaucracy and the relatively few other collaborators who had been aligned with the French and Japanese colonizers supported the U.S. occupation. The use of the term “Viet Cong” hides the basic fact that the war against Vietnam was a war against the Vietnamese people as a whole and not just a war against the “Vietnamese Communists.”\n8 A country’s economy is considered “dollarized” when the U.S. dollar circulates extensively within its economy—as opposed to simply being held as a reserve in a country’s treasury or central bank. In the case of Panama and Ecuador, the U.S. dollar has become the official currency. The “monetary authorities” of these countries no longer issue their own currencies. Their economies have become completely dollarized.\n9 The currencies of the countries—especially the two defeated axis powers Japan and West Germany—that were running large balance of trade and payments surpluses with the United States were less devalued against gold than the U.S. dollar was. Against the U.S. dollar, they were repeatably revalued.\nIn the case of Britain, whose industry was still steadily losing market share on the world market and was consequently running much larger deficits in its balance of trade and payments, its currency was devalued against gold even more than the U.S. dollar was. The pound was therefore devalued against the dollar as well as against gold.\nBut all the capitalist currencies without exception were massively devalued against the money commodity gold in the years that followed 1968-71. Not coincidentally those countries that devalued their currencies not only against gold but also the U.S. dollar, such as Britain, experienced even higher rates of inflation than the United States did. Conversely, those countries like West Germany and Japan that devalued their currencies less than the U.S. dollar was devalued experienced lower rates of inflation than the U.S. did.\n10 The dollar-gold exchange system did not really begin at Bretton Woods but arose after World War I when countries began to hold dollar-denominated U.S. government securities alongside gold in their reserves.\n11 In the wake of the Watergate scandal, Nixon had to resign the U.S. presidency, the only president in U.S. history to do so. To underline the completely corrupt nature of the Nixon administration, his “law and order” vice president, Spiro Agnew, had earlier resigned when it was revealed that “Mr. law and order” had been taking kickbacks when he was governor of Maryland—a felony.\nMany other officials of the Nixon administration also had to resign and serve prison sentences, including John Mitchell, Nixon’s “tough law and order” attorney-general, who was forced to spend time in prison for some of the felonies that he had committed while he was serving as the chief law-enforcement officer of the United States. Nixon thus became the most discredited president in U.S. history.\nMilton Friedman, who consistently supported the most right-wing Republican candidates, had his reasons for trying to disassociate himself from Richard Nixon.\nShare this:\nEmail\nReddit\nFacebook\nLoading...", "U.S. GDP Growth Rate 1961-2022 | MacroTrends\nU.S. GDP Growth Rate 1961-2022\nPopulation\nEconomy\nTrade\nHealth\nEducation\nDevelopment\nLabor Force\nEnvironment\nCrime\nImmigration\nOther\nGDP\nGDP Growth Rate\nGDP Per Capita\nGNI\nGNI Per Capita\nDebt to GDP\nGNP\nInflation Rate\nEconomic Growth\nManufacturing\nAnnual percentage growth rate of GDP at market prices based on constant local currency.

{"query_id": "2024-128784", "generated_response": "A career in civil engineering can be both challenging and rewarding, offering diverse opportunities to work on projects that directly impact communities. Here's what you can expect:\n\n## What Civil Engineers Do\n\nCivil engineering is a very demanding yet fulfilling career where you work on projects from inception to completion [1]. Civil engineers design, construct, and maintain infrastructure including roads, bridges, buildings, airports, dams, water systems, and sewage treatment facilities [1][10]. You'll interact with clients, architects, contractors, inspectors, and design teams throughout projects [1].\n\n## Work Environment & Daily Life\n\n**Mixed Indoor/Outdoor Work**: Civil engineers split time between office work (planning, designing, using CAD software) and field work (construction sites, monitoring progress) [8][10]. About 52% work in office environments daily, while 43% work outdoors at least once monthly [10].\n\n**Work Schedule**: Most civil engineers work full-time, with about 30% working more than 40 hours per week [10][18]. You may need to work extra hours to meet deadlines, and construction sites require monitoring in all weather conditions [1].\n\n**Variety**: No two days are the same - you work in different locations with new challenges regularly, making it perfect for those who thrive on change [13].\n\n## Advantages of Civil Engineering\n\n- **Job Security**: Civil engineers are constantly in demand as society always needs infrastructure [3][13]\n- **Good Pay**: Skilled civil engineers enjoy decent salary packages, with median annual wages around $95,440 [11][15]\n- **Respected Profession**: It's viewed as a prestigious career that people show interest in [5][13]\n- **Job Satisfaction**: High satisfaction from seeing tangible results - buildings, bridges, and infrastructure you helped create [1][12]\n- **Career Opportunities**: Wide variety of roles across different sectors including construction, government, consulting, and academia [3][6]\n- **Global Opportunities**: Excellent opportunities to work abroad, especially in Gulf countries [5]\n\n## Challenges & Disadvantages\n\n- **High Responsibility**: Significant pressure as structures must be safe and meet deadlines [4][5]. Mistakes can have serious consequences and be costly [13]\n- **Long Hours**: Projects can require extended work schedules, especially when meeting tight deadlines [5][7]\n- **Harsh Working Conditions**: Frequent site visits in various weather conditions, dust, and potentially hazardous environments [4][5]\n- **Remote Locations**: Projects may require working in remote or challenging locations away from urban areas [3][5]\n- **Lower Pay Compared to Tech**: Some engineers feel the compensation doesn't match the workload compared to other fields like computer science [12]\n\n## Career Growth & Specializations\n\nCivil engineering offers numerous specialization paths [6][19]:\n- **Structural Engineering**: Designing buildings, bridges, and major structures\n- **Transportation Engineering**: Planning roads, airports, and transit systems  \n- **Geotechnical Engineering**: Foundation and soil analysis\n- **Environmental Engineering**: Water treatment and environmental projects\n- **Construction Management**: Overseeing project execution\n\nCareer advancement typically involves obtaining a Professional Engineer (PE) license after 4+ years of experience, which opens doors to senior positions and project management roles [6][18].\n\n## Job Outlook\n\nThe field has positive growth prospects with 8-11% expected growth through 2030, driven by aging infrastructure needs and renewable energy projects [16][18].

My favorite part is the impact on the people we are serving. We are improving infrastructure. Everyone who lives and travels in that location relies on that infrastructure. I think it's sort of an after thought for the general public, but where would we all be without roads + bridges to get us places, storm sewer to prevent floods, treatment plants to ensure we have clean drinking and surface water, like it's all so important. The money aspect does bring me down though. Like an area could be in bad shape, but if there's no money to pay for it, than that project won't happen. It's disappointing. But I try to do the best I can with the opportunities I find.\n3. I think the biggest challenges are the funding. We are limited in what we can do if the client doesn't want to pay for it. Grants can help. I know people talk about salaries. Unfortunately for civil infrastructure, a lot of the money is from the government. The government typically tries to keep their costs down due to limited budget. Or sometimes a private entity will not want to pay a lot. They want to take short cuts and reduce spending whenever possible. Sometimes that is difficult on us because we have to do what we promised them with the money they have, and we can't do extra (unless the client agrees to extra).\n4. I'm sure there are a variety of people who would like civil! I think we are a little more social and less abstract than other disciplines in engineering. If you think building stuff and construction is cool, you'll like it. Many roles require going outside, which is fun. Roles like drilling oversight, construction oversight, or sampling.\nYou should have a good handle on math. I feel like a lot of what we do is imagining features in the world as simple geometry. There is a lot of looking at maps and understanding your projects environment spacially.\nGood luck on your report!\n5\nlevel 2\n· 5 mo. ago\nLove your insight into the civil engineering!\n2\nlevel 1\n· 5 mo. ago municipal P.E.\nPass\nIt's very fulfilling work and the pay is good enough to live a good life.\nThe only real persistent challenge is that not enough money is spent on infrastructure, so a lot of investments end up being half-measures, and a lot of systems end up running to failure, which can be stressful.\n3. This job is a good mix of technical expertise and building relationships, so anybody that wants to be technically proficient in a STEM field, plus have plenty of opportunities to network and engage with people will find success in this job.\n12\nlevel 1\n· 5 mo. ago\nOver on r/AskEngineers there's a list of engineers willing to be interviewed on one of the sidebar links, in case you want more people.\n2\nlevel 1\n· 5 mo. ago\nI'd rather not and don't know why it's important.

I’ve seen many people on this sub saying these people are the “squeaky wheels,” and I understand that to a certain degree, but it does seem to be getting more common.\nCommon complaints: low pay, high stress, better options in other industries, lack of respect or recognition from employer\nThere were 2 posts addressing these complaints. One took the stance of the “civil service” aspect of civil and how we can have a direct impact on people’s lives. The other took the stance of “not every company will treat you like shit. Do your research and jump ship, but don’t defame the industry as a whole. (paraphrasing)”\nPersonally, I’m enjoying the leverage that the working class appears to be gaining over their employers and I think it’s long overdue. No longer is it “why should we hire you?” But more so “why should I work for you?” But perspective is important, and we do have it pretty good here as opposed to sectors such as retail, healthcare, etc.\nJust thought I’d share.\n114 comments\n182\nPosted by 5 days ago\nWith boomers retiring in mass and our infrastructures current state, why are salary’s still so low?\nI do not understand, how is it possible for salary’s to remain this low!

A year later it cost him $12M\nI thought I'd share my exit interview experience since it comes up every now and again.\nI left a job I hated about 10 months ago. I hated my middle manager boss, not the owner. The owner was a good guy but  kept too many assholes in his management because they produced results. I'm still friends with the owner despite having left. But in my exit interview I told the owner very clearly:\n\"This is a growing company full of people with ambition. Expectations are set high and the compensation structure is not a meritocracy like you might want to think. It's middle managers picking their friends and favorites to hand out the largest stock bonuses to. It does not promote honesty.\"\nI followed that up with a story of a meeting I participated in where one of my coworkers told everyone an idea would not work. He articulated it greatly and everyone agreed it would not work. Then he presented an alternative. However, the middle manager already talked with his boss about the alternative and incorrectly came to a premature conclusion, telling his boss the alternative was not viable. The middle manager was not happy about having to walk back his original statements and it took a couple weeks for him to get over being wrong in front of his boss.\nFast forward to Monday. I got a call from an old colleague still working there. He informed me of a similar happening. A bunch of middle managers got together to present something to upper management. A week after the presentation one of the middle managers realized there was a problem with an accounting process. EXCEPT this problem was realized near the time the large bonuses were being handed out. Instead of reporting the problem and potentially disrupting their bonuses, they sat on it, planning to fix it in a couple months. A scammer stumbled upon this breakdown in the process and managed to steal $12M. Apparently there are emails of the middle managers agreeing to wait to fix the problem until after bonuses were distributed. Now insurance is refusing to reimburse because of their negligence.\nMy advice: No one gives a shit about what you have to say in an exit interview, regardless of how severe the consequences may be. There are a lot of voices in the world who call out problems. People have learned to ignore them. Put on a good face to preserve your relationships and move on.\n25 comments\nContinue browsing in r/civilengineering", "The Pros and Cons of Civil Engineering as a Career - Inline Engineering Services\nThe Pros and Cons of Civil Engineering as a Career\nChoosing a career for the future can be a pretty daunting prospect.

In this position, you design, develop and oversee construction of many types of buildings, roadways and infrastructure projects in communities. Civil engineers earn high pay and play an important role in community development, high pressure projects are common along with possibly long work weeks. Take a look at some of the key pros and cons of civil engineering jobs.\nCivil Engineer Salary and Benefits\nEngineering is an above average employment sector, and civil engineers certainly hold their own among peers when it comes to civil engineer salary and benefits. The average annual salary for all civil engineers was ​ $95,440 ​ as of May 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Top-end pay was much greater, with 10 percent making at or above ​ $144,810 ​ per year. Self employment offers top-level earning potential.\nArchitectural engineers is the largest sector within civil engineering. Average pay for professionals in this area was ​ $97,260 ​.\nCommunity Importance and Responsibility\nIf you want to balance community-mindedness and environmental responsibility with your passions for chemistry and engineering, civil engineering can be a great match. Many civil engineers contribute significantly to communities' infrastructure evolution by designing buildings. You can also play a key role by leading environmentally friendly roadway, waterway and sewage projects.\nAs you design and develop structures, you can often incorporate your concerns for its environmental impact. JMC2 Civil and Structural Engineering says you can also look into the various civil engineering specialties available so you can choose work that best fits your values and keeps you engaged.\nExtreme Pressure on the Job\nWith great importance comes significant job pressure. The buildings and projects you head up as a civil engineer are sometimes massive in scope and budget. Significant failures can lead to significant losses for your company, or a raise in the company's insurance premiums.\nFaulty engineering can also lead to calamities in communities from building degradation, road and bridge problems and water system malfunctions. Problems with your work can hurt your employer's reputation, or your own.\nCivil Engineer Hours Per Day\nCivil engineers sometimes work a typical full-time week. However, some of the difficulties in civil engineering is sometimes needing to do overtime as well as spend a good amount of time on the road. You spend some of the week in your office planning. Other work time is spent on site communicating with construction workers, overseeing projects and monitoring progress.\nJob Outlook for Civil Engineers\nThe pros and cons of civil engineering jobs also relate to the outlook since demand can vary based on construction project activity. The BLS says the outlook through 2030 will be good with an eight percent growth rate that's the same as what's expected for all occupations. However, it warns about government funding possibly dampening job opportunities in some locations, while some alternative energy and water system projects should boost demand.\nReferences\nWriter Bio", "Civil Engineering Career Paths - CareerExplorer\nSome degrees can lead to surprising careers.\nWhat job can you get with a civil engineering degree?\nMost civil engineering graduates go on to become civil engineers, geotechnical engineers, and water engineers. Civil engineering grads also go on to become construction managers and environmental engineers.

What is it?? Well, civil engineers help to design the infrastructure that is all around us. This diverse and challenging role touches every corner of society, from the sewer systems under our feet to the buildings that soar above our heads. Civil engineering plays a role in all corners of life and helps to create more efficient and pleasant environments for living, working and playing.\nWhat does a civil engineer do?\nCivil engineers can be categorised in two ways: consultants and contractors. Consultants will typically take control of the design and planning and will usually be based in an office most of the time. Contractors will then take these designs and help to implement them in the real world. Contractors are more likely to be based on building sites. There is often overlap between the two, but this is broadly how the role is split.\nCivil engineers design, plan and oversee construction for projects that will improve the environment around us. They might be involved with building skyscrapers and ensuring they can withstand all types of weather, or they might be involved with designing irrigation systems for farming in challenging conditions. Civil engineers are also involved in designing roads, dams, airports, harbours, bridges, power plants, water management systems and sewage systems. Typical tasks for a civil engineer could include:\nAnalysing soil samples for subsurface investigations\nCalculating the load stresses for new structures such as bridges\nImplementing flood defence plans to protect homes\nThe day-to-day role of a civil engineer will vary depending on the organisation they work for and the projects they help to design. Tasks could include any of the following:\nPlanning and designing new structures\nCarrying out site investigations\nUsing CAD software to create plans and designs\nUndertaking feasibility studies and investigating materials\nManaging budgets and project timelines\nLiaising with clients to update on progress and plans\nExploring ways to make structures more energy-efficient\nResolving design issues during construction\nCo-ordinating with architects and construction contractors\nDelivering presentations on recent projects\nExploring the impact of materials and processes on the environment\nTeaching work placement students about the sector\nWhere does a civil engineer typically work?\nYou may find work in the public or private sector, including employers like private construction companies, architecture companies, local government authorities, utility companies and rail companies.\nUnder the broad umbrella of civil engineering, specialising further could help you to secure a niche role. For example, you might specialise in naval engineering to secure a role with the Royal Navy or Marines. You could also specialise in environmental engineering, structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, water resources management or transport engineering.\nBy specialising, you will narrow your search for a role, but you could find yourself on a more lucrative career path. When searching for a role, consider specialist recruitment agencies first. This will offer a more targeted view of the job market than a general recruitment agency or a job board. You should also keep an eye on opportunities advertised through organisations such as the Institution of Civil Engineers.\nEntry-level job titles will typically be graduate civil engineer, or they could be more specific, such as graduate transportation engineer.\nQualifications and required training\nThere are two routes to a civil engineering career. Civil engineers will either join a school leavers training programme such as an apprenticeship, or they will study civil engineering at university.\nGraduates will need a degree that is accredited by the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). Once you have achieved your BEng you will have incorporated engineer status. Most people will go on to further study, as this will make them more desirable to employers. Once you have completed an MEng (masters) you will achieve chartered status.\nIf you are taking the graduate route, you can help your future job prospects by choosing a course that includes a work placement. This might be a summer internship or an entire year-long placement as part of your studies.\nIf you are taking the school leaver route, there are plenty of resources available to help you choose your path. A well-established apprenticeship with a reputable organisation will offer a combination of on-the-job experience with classroom learning to give you the skills and knowledge you need to succeed as a civil engineer.\nKey skills and competencies\nThese are some of the competencies and skills that employers will look for. Employers aren’t only looking for workers with technical skills but are also seeking those with commercial awareness to help make projects successful. Some key skills you will need include:\nMathematical and scientific skills\nIT skills and the ability to quickly adapt to new systems\nMethodical thinking and approach to work\nProblem-solving skills, both on-paper and in real-life situations\nAbility to manage project budgets and timelines\nVerbal and written communication skills\nAbility to multitask and remain calm under pressure\nLeadership and negotiating skills\nUp-to-date knowledge and experience of local regulations", "Civil Engineers - Future Job Demand\nHome >  Civil Engineers - Future Job Demand\nJob Outlook for:\nCivil Engineers\nSOC: 17-2051         OOH: U073\nCivil Engineers\nQuick Stats\nTotal Jobs in 2016\n303,500\nExpected Growth\n11%      (Faster than average)\nNew Jobs To Be Added\nfrom 2016 to 2026\n32,100\nMedian Pay\n$75,000 or more\nJob Outlook for Civil Engineers\nPay for Civil Engineers\nWhat do Civil Engineers do all day\nThe work environment\nHow to become one\nCivil and Transportation Engineers Career Video\nShort video describing:\nCivil Engineers\nEmployment Outlook for Civil Engineers\nEmployment of civil engineers is projected to grow 11 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. As current U.S. infrastructure experiences growing obsolescence, civil engineers will be needed to manage projects to rebuild, repair, and upgrade bridges, roads, levees, dams, airports, buildings, and other structures.\nA growing population likely means that new water systems will be required while, at the same time, aging, existing water systems must be maintained to reduce or eliminate leaks. In addition, more waste treatment plants will be needed to help clean the nation’s waterways. Civil engineers will continue to play a key part in all of this work.\nThe work of civil engineers will be needed for renewable-energy projects. Thus, as these new projects gain approval, civil engineers will be further involved in overseeing the construction of structures such as wind farms and solar arrays.\nAlthough state and local governments continue to face financial challenges and may have difficulty funding all projects, some delayed projects will have to be completed to build and maintain critical infrastructure, as well as to protect the public and the environment.\nJob Prospects\nApplicants who gain experience by participating in a co-op program while in college will have the best opportunities. In addition, new standards known collectively as the Body of Knowledge are growing in importance within civil engineering, and this development is likely to result in a heightened need for a graduate education. Therefore those who enter the occupation with a graduate degree will likely have better prospects.\nTypical Pay for Civil Engineers\nThe median annual wage for civil engineers was $83,540 in May 2016. \n\n\nThe median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $53,470, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $132,880.\nIn May 2016, the median annual wages for civil engineers in the top industries in which they worked were as follows:\nFederal government, excluding postal service\n$92,320\nLocal government, excluding education and hospitals\n88,370\nEngineering services\n82,710\nState government, excluding education and hospitals\n80,200\nNonresidential building construction\n77,170\nCivil engineers typically work full time, and about 3 in 10 worked more than 40 hours per week in 2016. Engineers who direct projects may need to work extra hours in order to monitor progress on projects, to ensure that designs meet requirements, and to guarantee that deadlines are met.\nWhat Civil Engineers Do All Day\nCivil engineers conceive, design, build, supervise, operate, construct and maintain infrastructure projects and systems in the public and private sector, including roads, buildings, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and systems for water supply and sewage treatment. Many civil engineers work in planning, design, construction, research, and education.\nDuties\nCivil engineers typically do the following:\nAnalyze long range plans, survey reports, maps, and other data to plan and design projects\nConsider construction costs, government regulations, potential environmental hazards, and other factors during the planning and risk-analysis stages of a project\nCompile and submit permit applications to local, state, and federal agencies, verifying that projects comply with various regulations\nOversee and analyze the results of soil testing to determine the adequacy and strength of foundations\nAnalyze the results of tests on building materials, such as concrete, wood, asphalt, or steel, for use in particular projects\nPrepare cost estimates for materials, equipment, or labor to determine a project’s economic feasibility\nUse design software to plan and design transportation systems, hydraulic systems, and structures in line with industry and government standards\nPerform or oversee surveying operations to establish building locations, site layouts, reference points, grades, and elevations to guide construction\nManage the repair, maintenance, and replacement of public and private infrastructure\nCivil engineers also must present their findings to the public on topics such as bid proposals, environmental impact statements, or property descriptions.\nMany civil engineers hold supervisory or administrative positions ranging from supervisor of a construction site to city engineer, public works director, and city manager. As supervisors, they are tasked with ensuring that safe work practices are followed at construction sites.\nOther civil engineers work in design, construction, research, and teaching. Civil engineers work with others on projects and may be assisted by civil engineering technicians.\nCivil engineers prepare permit documents for work on projects in renewable energy. They verify that the projects will comply with federal, state, and local requirements. These engineers conduct structural analyses for large-scale photovoltaic, or solar energy, projects. They also evaluate the ability of solar array support structures and buildings to tolerate stresses from wind, seismic activity, and other sources. For large-scale wind projects, civil engineers often prepare roadbeds to handle large trucks that haul in the turbines.\nCivil engineers work on complex projects, and they can achieve job satisfaction in seeing the project reach completion. They usually specialize in one of several areas.\nConstruction engineers manage construction projects, ensuring that they are scheduled and built in accordance with plans and specifications. These engineers typically are responsible for the design and safety of temporary structures used during construction. They may also oversee budgetary, time-management, and communications aspects of a project.\nGeotechnical engineers work to make sure that foundations for built objects ranging from streets and buildings to runways and dams, are solid. They focus on how structures built by civil engineers, such as buildings and tunnels, interact with the earth (including soil and rock). In addition, they design and plan for slopes, retaining walls, and tunnels.\nStructural engineers design and assess major projects, such as buildings, bridges, or dams, to ensure their strength and durability.\nTransportation engineers plan, design, operate, and maintain everyday systems, such as streets and highways, but they also plan larger projects, such as airports, ship ports, mass transit systems, and harbors.\nThe work of civil engineers is closely related to the work of environmental engineers.\nWork Environment for Civil Engineers\nCivil engineers held about 303,500 jobs in 2016. The largest employers of civil engineers were as follows:\nEngineering services\n48%\nState government, excluding education and hospitals\n12\nLocal government, excluding education and hospitals\n10\nNonresidential building construction\n6\nFederal government, excluding postal service\n3\nCivil engineers work in a variety of locations and conditions. When working on designs, civil engineers may spend most of their time indoors in offices. However, construction engineers may spend much of their time outdoors at construction sites monitoring operations or solving onsite problems. Some jobs may require frequent relocation to different areas and offices in jobsite trailers.\nCivil engineers who function as project managers may work from cars or trucks as they move from site to site. Many civil engineers work for government agencies in government office buildings or facilities. Occasionally, civil engineers travel abroad to work on large engineering projects in other countries.\nWork Schedules\nCivil engineers typically work full time, and about 3 in 10 worked more than 40 hours per week in 2016. Engineers who direct projects may need to work extra hours to monitor progress on the projects, to ensure that designs meet requirements, and to guarantee that deadlines are met.\nHow To Become a Civil Engineer\nCivil engineers need a bachelor’s degree. They typically need a graduate degree and a license for promotion to senior positions. Although licensure requirements vary from state to state, civil engineers usually must be licensed if they provide services directly to the public.\nEducation\nCivil engineers need a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering, in one of its specialties, or in civil engineering technology. Programs in civil engineering and civil engineering technology include coursework in math, statistics, engineering mechanics and systems, and fluid dynamics, depending on the specialty. Courses include a mix of traditional classroom learning, work in laboratories, and fieldwork. Programs may include cooperative programs, also known as co-ops, in which students gain work experience while pursuing a degree.\nA degree from a program accredited by ABET is needed to earn the professional engineer (PE) license. In many states, a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering technology also meets the academic requirement for obtaining a license.\nFurther education after the bachelor’s degree, along with the PE license and previous experience, is helpful in getting a job as a manager. For more information on engineering managers, see the profile on architectural and engineering managers.\nImportant Qualities\nDecisionmaking skills. Civil engineers often balance multiple and frequently conflicting objectives, such as determining the feasibility of plans with regard to financial costs and safety concerns. Urban and regional planners often look to civil engineers for advice on these issues. Civil engineers must be able to make good decisions based on best practices, their own technical knowledge, and their own experience.\nLeadership skills. Civil engineers take ultimate responsibility for the projects that they manage or research that they perform. Therefore, they must be able to lead planners, surveyors, construction managers, civil engineering technicians, civil engineering technologists, and others in implementing their project plan.\nMath skills. Civil engineers use the principles of calculus, trigonometry, and other advanced topics in mathematics for analysis, design, and troubleshooting in their work.\nOrganizational skills. Only licensed civil engineers can sign the design documents for infrastructure projects. This requirement makes it imperative that civil engineers be able to monitor and evaluate the work at the jobsite as a project progresses. That way, they can ensure compliance with the design documents. Civil engineers also often manage several projects at the same time, and thus must be able to balance time needs and to effectively allocate resources.\nProblem-solving skills. Civil engineers work at the highest level of the planning, design, construction, and operation of multifaceted projects or research. The many variables involved require that they possess the ability to identify and evaluate complex problems. They must be able to then use their skill and training to develop cost-effective, safe, and efficient solutions.\nSpeaking skills. Civil engineers must present reports and plans to audiences of people with a wide range of backgrounds and technical knowledge. This requires the ability to speak clearly and to converse with people in various settings, and to translate engineering and scientific information into easy-to-understand concepts.\nWriting skills. Civil engineers must be able to communicate with others, such as architects, landscape architects, urban and regional planners. They also must be able to explain projects to elected officials and citizens. Civil engineers must be able to write reports that are clear, concise, and understandable to those with little or no technical or scientific background.\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\nLicensure is not required for entry-level positions as a civil engineer. A Professional Engineering (PE) license, which allows for higher levels of leadership and independence, can be acquired later in one’s career. Licensed engineers are called professional engineers (PEs). A PE can oversee the work of other engineers, approve design plans, sign off on projects, and provide services directly to the public. State licensure generally requires\nA degree from an ABET-accredited engineering program\nA passing score on the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam\nRelevant work experience, typically at least 4 years working under a licensed engineer\nA passing score on the Professional Engineering (PE) exam\nThe initial FE exam can be taken after earning a bachelor’s degree. Engineers who pass this exam commonly are called engineers in training (EITs) or engineer interns (EIs). After meeting work experience requirements, EITs and EIs can take the second exam, called the Principles and Practice of Engineering.\nEach state issues its own licenses. Most states recognize licensure from other states, as long as the licensing state’s requirements meet or exceed their own licensure requirements. Several states require continuing education for engineers to keep their licenses.\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers offers certifications in coastal engineering, geotechnical engineering, ports engineering, water resources engineering, and other fields. Additionally, civil engineers can become certified in building security and in sustainability.\nOther Experience\nDuring high school, students can attend engineering summer camps to see what these and other engineers do. Attending these camps can help students plan their coursework for the remainder of their time in high school.\nAdvancement\nCivil engineers with ample experience may move into senior positions, such as project managers or functional managers of design, construction, operation, or maintenance. However, they would first need to obtain the Professional Engineering (PE) license, because only licensed engineers can assume responsibilities for public projects.\nAfter gaining licensure, a professional engineer may seek credentialing that demonstrates his or her expertise in a civil engineering specialty. Such a credential may be helpful for advancement to senior technical or even managerial positions.", "Civil and Structural Engineering: Careers, Jobs, Salaries, Top Colleges & Online Courses\n»\nBlog Career Guidance Civil and Structural Engineering: Careers, Jobs, Salaries, Role in Sustainability, Top Colleges and Online Courses\nCivil and Structural Engineering: Careers, Jobs, Salaries, Role in Sustainability, Top Colleges and Online Courses\nBy Tanmoy Ray\nOn September 13, 2018\nIn Career Guidance, Parents Must Read, Study Abroad, Under Graduate\nLast Updated on November 14, 2021\nCivil Engineering is one one of the core and oldest branches of engineering.

The field of structural engineering focuses on the framework of structures, and on designing those structures to withstand the stresses and pressures of their environment and remain safe, stable and secure throughout their use.\n“Generally, structural engineers create framework, drawing, specifications, observe construction sites, perform calculations and oversee the constructions of new buildings”.\nIn other words, structural engineers make sure that buildings don’t fall down and bridges don’t collapse.\nStructural engineers often work alongside civil engineers and architects as part of a construction team.\n“if a structure was a human body, then the architect would be concerned with the body shape and appearance, and the structural engineer would be concerned with the skeleton and sinews.”\nJob Roles and Responsibilities of a Structural Engineer\nThe duties of a Structural Engineer depend on the structure he has to build. Working closely with clients, architects, building contractors, other engineers he has to perform the following duties-\nHe has to design different parts of the structure by using computer software.\nHe has to perform the task of drawings and make the framework of the different structures like buildings, bridges, tunnels, towers, etc.\nIn order to construct the building, he has to go through mathematical calculations accurately.\nHe has to select the construction materials and the appropriate proportions of the mortar that will be used to construct the particular building or structure.\nBefore repairing an existing structure like bridge he has to perform different tests like ring corrosion test, ultrasonography test, reflection test to measure to assess its structural integrity.\nHe has to perform the concerned tests to find out whether the structural components of the building can withstand environmental or human-generated stresses, strain & pressures.\nHe has to calculate the total cost of the project.\nA structural engineer has to maintain communication with the construction contractors and make sure that the different parts like piers, girders, deck slab of the newly constructed bridge and pillars, beams, RCC roof of the newly erected building are structurally sound.\nHe has to consult with different scientific experts and gather knowledge about how different forces of nature act on the built structure.\nHe has to employ Computer-aided design technology for a simulation to see different behaviours of the built structure under different environmental conditions.\nInspecting the damage caused to the building materials like steel, concrete, glass, etc. of an unsafe building and advising the contractors about the ways of improving the safety of the structure of the concerned building.\nThe structural engineer has to look after whether the building follows the legal guidelines, health & safety regulations as well as environmental rules.\nDemand and Job Prospects in Structural Engineering\nStructural engineers make sure all our buildings and infrastructure are safe to use. A structural engineer works with the architect who helps ensure that the beams and other underlying structural pieces of the building will hold up under the particular stresses that the building or other structure will be under. With increasing urbanization and factors like climate change & energy efficiency, the demand for structural engineering will rise further.\nWhile there is not a high turnover rate in these positions, there will be new openings as companies look for more structural engineers to provide their services.\nStructural engineers advance in their careers by taking on more difficult projects and by helping manage other engineering teams. Some specialize in a particular area and contract out their services as independent consultants.\nRole of Structural Engineering in Green Building & Sustainable Development\nAt present, the demand for Green Building & Sustainable Development is fuelling the career scopes of structural engineering.\nUrbanization, buildings, and civil infrastructure are vital for any economy in the world. However, large quantities of natural resources and energy are required for their construction, operation, maintenance and demolition.\nBuilding construction consumes natural resources, potable water and energy. Secondly, the construction process also contributes to 30% of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, sustainable environment is not achievable without contribution from the building & construction sector, especially from the structural engineering domain.\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), the construction and operation of buildings are vital for social upliftment and sustainability.\nIn the US, the demand for green buildings has increased from 2.5% in 2005 to 32% in 2010. The global scenario is no different as well. In countries like India, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, France, Ireland, Canada, US etc., a lot of focus is given on structural engineering.\nStructural engineers play a vital role in the efficient design, construction and performance of a building. Structural engineers, in collaboration with the architects, owners and/or construction managers decide on the viability of architectural concepts, constructability and cost-effectiveness at the inception of construction projects. As the project progresses to the design stage, structural engineers are the first to produce a set of working design documents.\nStructural engineers traditionally have not identified themselves with environmental sustainability. Growing concern for the natural environment, the emergence of smart cities, and the increasing importance of sustainability & energy efficiency are driving the demand for structural engineers.\nThe renewable energy sector is also a great driving factor. The concept of sustainability is gaining popularity these days and it’s applicability to the energy sector is clear. Hence, overall, the career & job prospects of structural engineers are very bright in the coming days.\nRelated Articles:\nIoT Enabled Smart Home Automation Using Renewable Energy Sources\nCareers in Renewable & Sustainable Energy\nEducation, Skills and Training for a Career in Structural Engineering\nRequired Education\nA master’s degree is a must-have for a structural engineer, and almost all have at least a master’s in either structural or civil engineering. Training is essential, as well, and engineers must work for several years in a sort of apprenticeship under other, more experienced engineers before taking a test that gives them a license as a Professional Engineer.\nAt the Bachelors level, it’s ideal to pursue B.Tech. or B.E. in Civil Engineering, and then opting for Masters (MS, M.Tech. or M.Sc.) in Structural Engineering. Even graduates from the Mechanical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Architecture are also eligible to pursue Structural Engineering at the postgraduate level (Masters and PhD).\nRequired Key Skills\nThe Structural Engineers must have a sound knowledge in the subjects like Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry & Information Technology.\nHe should possess a solid up-to-date technical knowledge about the subject.\nThey should have the ability to analyze any small or big project with a detail-oriented & creative mind.\nHe should have the ability to solve complex problems regarding the project.\nThey should have the capacity to communicate with fellow engineers as well as with the public to explain the technical, environmental aspects of any taken project.\nThe Structural Engineers have to possess time managing capacity in order to finish a project within a scheduled period.\nBesides having a solid knowledge of construction methodology he also required to know the different codes, legal, health and safety rules & regulations that are specifically connected with the industry. Knowing these rules is necessary for the successful completion of a project.\nHe must be proficient in Computer-Aided Drafting software and other applications integral to Structural engineering such as Auto Cad (Autocad 2000i), MATLAB, STAAD, RISA, SAP etc. He should be familiar with word processing and spreadsheet programme.\nHe should possess strong written communication skills.\nHe should have the ability to draw diagrams related to the construction.\nHe should have a good concept in three-dimensional diagrams.\nAbility to work in a team is mandatory.\nHe should have an interest in understanding the design & structure of any built structure.\nStructural Engineering Salaries in India and Abroad\nIn India, the salary of a Structural Engineer ranges from Rs.34,000 to Rs.42,000 per month. For those Engineers who have gained experience can receive a salary ranging from Rs.67,000 to Rs.100,000 lakh per month.

{"query_id": "2024-79081", "generated_response": "Based on the search results, Taylor Swift's age has significantly affected her relationships in several key ways across different periods of her life:\n\n## Early Relationships: Vulnerability Due to Youth\n\nWhen Swift was in her late teens and early twenties, she was involved in several relationships with much older men that created problematic power imbalances [3][7][17]:\n\n- **John Mayer relationship (2009)**: Swift was 19, Mayer was 32 - a 13-year age gap [10][12]\n- **Jake Gyllenhaal relationship (2010)**: Swift was 20-21, Gyllenhaal was 29-30 - a 9-year age gap [3][12]\n\nThese age differences created situations where Swift, despite being legally an adult, was at a very different life stage than her partners [4][5]. As one expert noted: \"The two partners are likely going to be at vastly different levels of maturity as well as stages of life\" [4].\n\n## The Impact of Being Young in Age-Gap Relationships\n\nSwift's youth made her particularly vulnerable to manipulation and emotional harm [3][5]:\n\n- She was \"unable to even drink legally in the United States\" while dating men approaching 30 [4]\n- The power imbalances included differences in \"maturity, power, and life experience\" [17]\n- In \"All Too Well,\" Swift references how Gyllenhaal used their age difference against her: \"You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would have been fine / And that made me want to die\" [3][7]\n\n## Maturation and Learning\n\nAs Swift aged, her approach to relationships fundamentally changed [1][13]:\n\n### Learning Privacy (Late 20s)\nBy her late twenties, Swift learned the value of keeping relationships private. Her relationship with Joe Alwyn (starting in 2016 when she was 26-27) represents this maturation [1][13]:\n\n- She became \"strategic about her relationship with Alwyn\" after being \"buried in media\" during previous relationships [1]\n- A source noted: \"Joe has really showed her a different lifestyle and the value of privacy\" [1]\n\n### Psychological Development\nResearch shows that \"as we age, our relationship style tends to change, for the better\" and people \"feel more secure in their relationships\" with lower anxiety levels [1]. Swift's age progression appears to follow this pattern.\n\n## Current Perspective: Reflection and Growth\n\nNow in her thirties, Swift has gained perspective on her earlier relationships [3][16]:\n\n- Her re-recording of \"All Too Well\" reflects how \"women remember relationships they had with older men in their teens and twenties and wake up like 'wait, that was exploitation'\" [3][7]\n- She's learned to prioritize \"transparency and good communication\" and the importance of knowing someone before entering a relationship [6]\n- Her current relationship with Alwyn (age-appropriate and private) demonstrates her evolved approach to love [13]\n\n## Broader Impact on Her Art\n\nSwift's age and relationship experiences have influenced her songwriting evolution [18]:\n\n- Early songs romanticized love and heartbreak\n- Her \"Red\" era began showing more cynicism about relationships\n- Recent work reflects more mature perspectives on love and growth\n\nSwift's journey illustrates how age and maturity can help someone recognize unhealthy relationship patterns and develop better boundaries, ultimately leading to healthier partnerships.", "citations": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-age.html/", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/taylor-swift-dating-19_n_57867108e4b08608d3328528", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/taylor-swift-all-too-well-relationship-age-gap-b1958428.html", "https://www.redbrick.me/lessons-from-all-too-well-how-age-gap-relationships-create-power-imbalances/", "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/taylor-swift-all-too-well-age-gap-relationships_uk_6193a2a8e4b005197af6bcc6\n", "https://thexplorion.com/taylor-swift-shares-tips-on-love-and-relationships/", "https://news.yahoo.com/taylor-swift-too-well-making-102548060.html", "https://www.abc.net.au/everyday/taylor-swift-all-too-well-taylors-version-age-gap-relationships/100540094\n", "https://www.bustle.com/wellness/taylor-swift-all-too-well-age-gap-relationships\n", "https://www.businessinsider.com/timeline-of-taylor-swifts-relationships-2012-12", "https://www.distractify.com/p/did-taylor-swift-date-a-17-year-old", "https://www.distractify.com/p/how-old-was-taylor-swift-when-she-dated-jake-gyllenhaal\n", "https://www.goalcast.com/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-relationship-proves-growth-maturity/", "https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/relationships/all-too-well-has-us-asking-when-is-an-age-gap-inappropriate/ar-AAQJT6m", "https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-on-the-end-of-the-squad", "https://nextmag.ca/why-didnt-we-think-she-was-too-young/", "https://www.glamour.com/story/all-too-well-has-us-asking-when-is-an-age-gap-inappropriate\n", "https://studybreaks.com/culture/music/comes-taylor-swifts-outlook/"], "contexts": ["Is Taylor Swift's Age Why Her Relationship With Joe Alwyn Is Different?\nHome / Music /\nIs Taylor Swift’s Age Why Her Relationship With Joe Alwyn Is Different?\nJess Bolluyt\nMore Articles: music\nPublished on\nSeptember 29, 2018\nMost people get wiser with age, and Taylor Swift seems to be one of them. After several very public relationships and breakups — most notably with Tom Hiddleston — she seems to be taking a much more mature approach to her love life. She’s doing everything she can to keep her relationship with Joe Alwyn private.\nHere’s what you need to know about the couple, and how Taylor Swift’s age may be a factor in making their relationship work.\nTaylor Swift is keeping her relationship Joe Alwyn private\nTaylor Swift | Lisa O’Connor/ AFP/ Getty Images\nE! News reports that in contrast with two of her most recent celebrity relationships — with Tom Hiddleston and Calvin Harris, plus brief but highly publicized romances with Harry Styles and John Mayer — Taylor Swift is keeping her relationship with Joe Alwyn private. The publication reported mid-2017 that Swift was traveling back and forth between England, where Alwyn lives, and Nashville, her home base. And it was only recently that the couple even made a public outing where they were spotted holding hands.\nThe couple has traveled to New York together, but have kept the time they spend together as discreet as possible. That represents a departure from Swift’s modus operandi. Vogue reports that “When it comes to real estate, pop culture references, or years-long feuds, subtlety, in other words, has apparently never been Swift’s strong suit.” A source told E! News at the time that Swift was strategic about her relationship with Alwyn.\n“She got buried in media being on top of her life during the last relationship, so she tried everything in her power to not have that happen again,” the source said. “She doesn’t want the photos, the hysteria, the speculation. When she’s ready, she’ll talk about it. Don’t expect this to play out like her other relationships. She’s taking it seriously and keeping her private life separate.”\nAlwyn doesn’t want to talk about the relationship, either\nAs E! News notes, Joe Alwyn talked to British Vogue about his relationship with Taylor Swift — but only after the couple had dated for almost two years, since the beginning of 2017. “I’m aware people want to know about that side of things,” Alwyn told the publication. “I think we have been successfully very private and that has now sunk in for people. . . but I really prefer to talk about work.”\nWhen Swift travels to the United Kingdom, she reportedly goes by private jet or lands in a private airfield, skipping airport terminals, and having airline employees assist in checking her passport on the tarmac instead of going through customs. When she lands in the U.K., she gets driven to Alwyn’s flat in a “fairly nondescript blacked-out car.”\nUs Weekly spoke to a source that said, “Joe has really showed her a different lifestyle and the value of privacy .” The source also added, “Taylor is so much happier without her personal life in the open. She credits Joe for that and realizes how much better off she is.”\nTaylor Swift’s age might be one reason why she’s keeping this relationship private\nTaylor Swift was born on December 13, 1989, and she’ll turn 29 before the end of 2018. Joe Alwyn was born on February 21, 1991, which means that he’s 27. They’re both pretty young, in the grand scheme of things. But Swift’s age might be one reason why she’s taking a more mature approach to her relationships, and to her relationship with Joe Alwyn specifically.\nQuartz reports that “as we age, our relationship style tends to change, for the better.” Psychologists found that “age seems to significantly impact the level of anxiety and avoidance people feel about relationships.” As people grow older, they feel more secure in their relationships. Plus, they also report lower levels of anxiety about their relationships. “As we age, we tend to more deeply invest in the roles of partnership — and that changes our interpersonal behaviors and personalities.”\nOf course, people’s personalities don’t change completely as they age. And things that Taylor Swift has always done — like writing songs about her love interests — likely won’t change even as she approaches her thirties. Entertainment Weekly reports that on Reputation, Swift invokes Alwyn “ over and over again as a refuge and a savior, the only person she can trust in a world where ‘All the liars are calling me one/ Nobody’s heard from me for months.'” She may be retreating from the limelight a little, but she’s still Taylor Swift.\nRead more: Why Justin Bieber’s Age Isn’t Stopping Him From Marrying Hailey Baldwin\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "19-Year-Old Taylor Swift: 'I've Never Been A Boyfriend Girl' | HuffPost Communities\nOWN\n19-Year-Old Taylor Swift: 'I've Never Been A Boyfriend Girl'\n\"I'm better single.\"\nLisa Capretto — OWN\nJul. 13, 2016, 06:33 PM EDT\nEveryone’s got something to say about Taylor Swift ’s dating life.

Though Swift was rumored to be dating actor Taylor Lautner at the time, she spoke in generalities, explaining her usual approach to romance.\n“For me, I’ve never been a boyfriend girl, where I’ve always got a boyfriend,” Swift said. “As far as relationships, that’s me making an exception.”\nSince that appearance, Swift has been linked to some of Hollywood’s most famous entertainers, including John Mayer, Harry Styles, Calvin Harris and, more recently, Tom Hiddleston.

TikTok trends and Spotify binges aside, after the release of her 10-minute version of the breakup song ‘All Too Well’ and the accompanying short film (written and directed by Swift), a more serious topic has resurfaced. Once again, popular culture is debating whether relationships with a significant age gap can be healthy, or whether the power imbalance caused by a large age difference makes it simply impossible.\n“\nThe two partners are likely going to be at vastly different levels of maturity as well as stages of life\nThis is an age-old (no pun intended) debate. Many people seem to believe that an age gap in a relationship matters less the older the partners are– for instance, a 55-year-old and a 65-year-old are much closer in maturity than a 19-year-old and a 29-year-old. This issue with such a large age gap at a young age is that the two partners are likely going to be at vastly different levels of maturity as well as stages of life. It is likely that when you consider your personality nine years ago, you are picturing a very different person from who you are now. The older partner here has been in the adult, working world for over a decade, whilst the younger partner here has either just left school or may even be a fresher in university.\nIn the case of Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal (the alleged couple portrayed in the short film), she was only 20 when they began dating, and him 29. Taylor here was not long an adult, unable to even drink legally in the United States, whilst Jake Gyllenhaal was already a very famous actor and was approaching 30. Although it is true that Taylor’s music career had already begun to take off, and this likely meant that she was forced to mature very quickly and she would still not have been at a similar stage of life to Gyllenhaal. A 29-year-old could feasibly be at the stage of life to start settling down and having kids, and while some people do choose to start a family early, I can confidently say as a 21-year-old that most of my friends and I are terrified at the thought of having a child at this age. The large age difference is particularly stark when viewing the ‘All Too Well’ short film, as there is an 11-year age gap between Sadie Sink (19) and Dylan O’Brien (30). Sink looks extremely young and innocent in contrast to O’Brien’s rugged beard and mature style.\n“\nIt is questionable that someone approaching 30 would be attracted to the immaturity of a 20-year-old\nWhilst some couples succeed in a relationship with a large age gap, it is important to consider the power imbalance that a difference such as this can cause. Whilst it may be understandable as to why a person would seek an older, more mature partner, it is questionable that someone approaching 30 would be attracted to the immaturity of a 20-year-old. Of course, physical attraction plays a role in every relationship. However, there may also be a need for power from the older partner. Age gives a person status in society, and an age gap also may (in non-celebrity relationships) be accompanied by a wealth gap, as it is likely that the older partner is more financially stable than a 20-year-old. This provides the older partner with power over the younger partner that they may wield maliciously much more easily than with a partner their own age.\nIt is true that some relationships with large age gaps do succeed, but it is likewise important to be aware of the dangers of this situation. In these scenarios, the younger partner in the relationship can often be vulnerable, therefore falling victim to a power imbalance owing to the fact that they are just happy to be admired by an older, more mature suitor. If you find yourself getting into a relationship with someone much older than yourself, listen carefully to your friends and family. It may seem as though they just don’t understand your relationship, the chances are that older people will be able to see more clearly if the power imbalance in the relationship is too strong to be healthy. Just don’t let the rose-tinted goggles of love cloud your vision too much.\nRead more from Life&Style:\nSpotlight On: Artists as Activists\nRejecting the ‘Good Girl Complex’\nThe Name’s Misogyny, Rampant Misogyny: Why ‘Bond Girls’ Are Outdated Stereotypes", "Taylor Swift's All Too Well Has Us Reflecting On Age-Gap Relationships | HuffPost UK Life\nLife\nTaylor Swift's All Too Well Has Us Reflecting On Age-Gap Relationships\n\"When you look at red flags through rose coloured glasses, they just look like flags.”\nBy\nFaima Bakar\n17/11/2021 05:00am GMT\nUMG\nDylan O’Brien and Sadie Sink in the All Too Well video.\nWhen I was 22, I began dating a lawyer in his 30s who I had nothing in common with. My age was bought up a lot – initially as a way to pit me and my “maturity” against “other girls my age”, then eventually to belittle me for being “a kid”.\nAnd it seems many other women who entered a relationship in early adulthood with someone considerably older than them can relate.\nOver the weekend, Taylor Swift’s All Too Well was re-released in a 10-minute version, with extra lyrics and an accompanying 14-minute short film, telling the story of an age gap relationship.\nThere’s been major speculation the song was inspired by the star’s former relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal, who was nine years her senior when they dated over 10 years ago. Swift has not confirmed if the story and film are based on personal experience, or entirely fictional. Still, the music video starring actors Dylan O’Brien, 30, and Sadie Sink, 19, has got a lot of people talking.\nDuring the video, directed by Swift herself, we see a heated argument between the fictional couple, in which O’Brien’s character belittles Sink’s character and manipulates her feelings. For many viewers watching, the relationship speaks to the unequal power dynamics that are sometimes to be found in relationships with a significant age-gap.\nWhile some of these relationships can and do work, particularly in later adulthood, a difference in age can be particularly tricky – or potentially problematic – when one person is in a different life stage to another.\nSince the video’s release, many girls and women have been sharing the difficulties they have faced, as seen in the All Too Well video.\nFOTOGRAFIA INC. via Getty Images\nOther women can relate to Taylor Swift's music video.\nLike Sink’s character, who has to deal with her partner’s tantrums, I too watched my former partner throw car keys at me, tell me I was blowing things out of proportion, and gaslight me over how things had been. I wish I had seen the signs earlier and questioned why a man in his 30s had courted someone a decade younger, and why he wasn’t interested in women his own age.\nThis is something 20-year-old Sara* can relate to. When she was 18, she met a 36-year-old lawyer at a party.\n“He was extremely charming,” Sara, from London, tells me. “It was supposed to be a casual thing, but one thing lead to another and we ended up being a lot more serious than we were supposed to be.\n“I think the biggest red flag was all of his exes were a lot more younger than him. And it seemed like he was getting older but the exes were between 18-22.”\nIt soon became evident that Sara and this man were at different stages of their lives. “I was still at uni halls trying to make do with ramen for dinner and he was this really cool lawyer who had his own 4-bedroom house and expensive cars,” she says.\nSara realises the unequal footing they had been on now, but at the time, she could only revere him. Eventually, the cracks in their age gaps began to show and they broke up recently, just shy of their two-year anniversary.\n“You unknowingly idealise them in your head, so much and you feel like you require their validation every step of the way,” she says.\n“The thing I distinctly remember is how he would make me cry and put me in the some of the darkest moments of my life and then instantly have a way of making it seem like it was my fault.”\nSara said friends raised concerns about gaslighting in the relationship, but for a long time she didn’t recognise these behaviours.\n“He also had a way of making it seem like he was smarter than me in every aspect and made sure to point it out every step of the way,” she says. “As they say, when you look at red flags through rose coloured glasses, they just look like flags.”\nSara was of legal age (as was Swift in the story of All Too Well – “It’s supposed to be fun turning twenty-one” ), but other women have been reflecting on relationships they’ve had with older partners when they were minors.\nHeather*, a 23-year-old neuroscientist from Texas, began seeing a man in his early 20s when she was 15.\n“I remember before we started dating, I googled age of consent laws (which was 16 in our state) because I was worried I would get him in trouble,” she says. “Looking back on it now, if you have to google age of consent, you should probably just walk away.”\nWhen the pair started dating, she says he began cutting her off from friends, and they ended up only socialising with him and his friends.\n“The scene in the All Too Well film where they’re arguing after a dinner party brought back a flood of memories,” she says. “Any time he and I were with his friends, he would hardly acknowledge me, and he would use those same gaslight-y arguments. Any time we disagreed or I mentioned how he was treating me, he would call me immature.”\nIn hindsight, Heather describes the behaviour of this man as “extremely verbally abusive” and says he often focused on her age as a way to belittle her. “Also due to our age difference, he was a bit obsessed with my virginity,” she says. “That in itself should have been a huge red flag, but I was only 15 and hadn’t had a serious relationship yet.”\nAfter their break up, Heather says it took years of therapy for her to feel ready for a “normal” relationship.\n“I think in our culture men dating younger women is too normalised, and so a lot of people saw nothing wrong with our relationship,” she says. “I’m now in a very healthy long-term relationship, but every now-and-again I’ll find another behaviour or something I do in this relationship that I developed to protect myself from people like [him].”\nVictoria Guerrero, 22, also from Texas, had a similar experience, although she didn’t share a huge age gap. When she was 19, she started seeing a man who was five years older.\n“We met at the university we both attended,” she explains. “Although it was a small age gap, I was 19 when the relationship started which made a huge difference. It was the first serious relationship I had with someone I met during college.\n“Age played a huge part in our relationship because I was constantly hyperaware of how less experienced at life I was than him, and he also reminded me at every step of the relationship that he was much more mature and responsible than I was.”\nGuerrero\nVictoria started seeing an older man when she was 19.\nGuerrero was the same age as her boyfriend’s little sister, but she says she felt “enamoured” by the idea that an older man could be interested in her.\n“Looking back now, I don’t know why I didn’t question that he wasn’t interested in people his own age,” she says. “I still feel pain, sadness, and regret when I look back at it but I also feel glad that it’s behind me and I know so much more now than I did at 19.”\nFor this reason, Guerrero was especially moved by the All Too Well video.\n“I think that’s why the release of the 10-minute version of All Too Well is so special to me because she was in a very raw and heartbroken state when she first released the original version and now she sings it from an empowered state of knowing that she’s grown from it, even though she shouldn’t have had to go through that experience in the first place, which is something I really relate to.”\n*Some names have been changed and surnames omitted to provide anonymity.\nSuggest a correction\nMore:\nwellbeing sex and relationships Taylor Swift", "Taylor Swift Shares Tips on Love and Relationships\nRelationship\n4 minute read\nTaylor Swift Shares Tips on Love and Relationships\nEmmanuella Oluwafemi\nApril 4, 2022\nTaylor Swift is one singer that no doubt is extremely talented as a matter of fact, this songwriter can be considered one of the most successful in the music industry worldwide.\nJust in case you do not know all Taylor Swift songs are autobiographical and this lady has had quite a number of relationships.\nAs Taylor Swift is about to turn thirty, a lot of people are wondering what this beautiful woman has learnt about love so far.\n- Advertisement -\nWe got lucky enough to have her reveal the love life lessons she has learned until now, and we are ready to share all the juicy information with you.\n30 things taylor swift learnt before turning 30\nTaylor Swift recently gave an interview titled 30 things I learnt before turning 30 for the newest issue of Elle.

But this hasn't been confirmed.(Supplied: Toglenn, Wikipedia/AP: Evan Agostini/ABC Everyday: Luke Tribe)\nWhen you're young — but over 18, to be clear — the idea of dating someone older can feel exciting.\nThey might seem more mature, appear more worldly or interesting. When they give you attention, it can make you feel special; out of everyone they could have chosen you were the one.\nWhen it doesn't work out, it can be hard to process what exactly you wanted from it, to come to terms with what the reality was, and what you wish you'd known before any of it happened.\nThis is what Taylor Swift's recently updated song, All Too Well (Taylor's Version), tries to articulate.\nVideo unavailable\nWatch on YouTube\nWatch on\nYouTube All Too Well (Taylor's Version)\nAsk any Swiftie and they'll tell you the song's about actor Jake Gyllenhaal. This absolutely has not been confirmed and is very much a rumour. But Taylor and Jake reportedly dated for a few months in 2010. At that time, she was 20 and he was nearing 30.\nSo it would have been perfectly legal — and arguably nine years isn't a huge age gap — but is a relationship when you're at very different life stages healthy?\nThis article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.\nThrough the re-recorded version of her 2012 album Red, Taylor is publicly considering the \"love affair that maimed\" her, differently and asking us to as well.\nIn the fresh lyrics, she sings about \"weepin' in a party bathroom\" on the night of her 21st birthday, as she waited in vain for a certain someone to arrive.\n\"You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine / And that made me want to die,\" the song continues.\nThe last verse begins: \"And I was never good at telling jokes but the punchline goes / 'I'll get older but your lovers stay my age'.\"\nJake is 40 now. His current girlfriend, Jeanne Cadieu, is 25. That's just a statement of fact — no positive or negative judgement there (from me at least).\nLook beyond the celebrity drama/gossip and there are some big things to mull over off the back of all of this — particularly if you're the kind of person who's found yourself drawn to dating older people and wondering how healthy that is, if you're in an age-gap relationship at the moment, or if you were once in one that you now realise wasn't right.\nThe experts say age-gap relationships aren't problematic by default\n\"A lot of the concerns around age-gap relationships are around a potential imbalance of power,\" says counsellor Keisha Singleton.\n\"But there will always be power imbalances in every relationship, whether they're based on the financial status of one person or someone's employment status, for example.\"\nTaylor and Jake reportedly dated in 2010, when she was 20 and he was 29.\nShe thinks it's not necessarily about whether there's an imbalance, but whether that imbalance fosters an unhealthy environment.\nSex and relationship therapist Nadine Aateeyah agrees.\n\"It's such an individualistic experience and journey, and there are healthy and unhealthy versions of everything,\" she explains.\n\"There's an assumption [with age-gap relationships that] those who are older are preying on those who are younger.

Taylor Swift, in all her benevolence, not only released her album Red (Taylor’s Version) which included the 10-minute version of her breakup anthem “All Too Well”, but she also dropped a short film version of the song on YouTube. Written and directed by Swift herself, the short stars actors Sadie Sink and Dylan O’Brien and depicts what is widely assumed to be the short-lived relationship between Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal from 2010. At the time, the pair would’ve had a nine-year age difference (Swift being 20 and Gyllenhaal 29), which Taylor did not shy away from commenting on in her new lyrics. While age gap relationships are fairly common — 8.5% of all heterosexual married couples in America have an age difference of 10 or more years, according to a 2011 study — they come with their fair share of challenges.\nIn the updated version, Swift sings “You said if we had been closer in age / Maybe it would’ve been fine” signaling that perhaps the couple’s age difference was a contributing factor to their breakup — or at the very least, something that was top of mind. Although it’s possible for people in age gap relationships to find that they have a lot in common with their partner, certified clinical sexologist Dr. Janet Morrison tells Bustle, “the [fewer] developmental milestones they have in common,” the more issues they’re likely to face. Between social stigma and other challenges, couples with a large age gap can certainly face an uphill battle, but there are also plenty of ways in which they can make the relationship work.\nWhy Age Gap Relationships Are Often Stigmatized\nThere’s a tendency for people to be automatically suspicious of age gap relationships, and as Dr. Schewitz says, friends and family might not always approve. The older partner’s social network may discount the seriousness of the relationship, writing the younger person off as the “shiny new thing,” rather than someone they should make an effort to get to know, Dr. Coleman says.\nIt’s also, surprise surprise, a situation that’s typically harder for women to navigate than men. People are quick to label a woman who dates older men as having “daddy issues,” but the reverse situation doesn’t necessarily draw the same stigma. In fact, Dr. Morrison says that when older women date younger men (only about 1.3% of couples with a large age difference, according to the same 2011 study ), they’re often slapped with the predatory “cougar” label.\nThere is also a common belief, often exacerbated in the way the media portrays age gap relationships, that younger women look for older men in order to feel taken care of. While that may be the case in some situations, Coleman says that the stereotypical “daddy issues” thing is “a tremendous oversimplification” of the many, often valid reasons why a young woman might seek out an older partner. According to Coleman, the initial attraction can be that their older partner is “exciting and worldly,” especially as compared to others in their own age group.\nCommon Challenges With Age Gap Relationships\nIn the “All Too Well” short film, an emotionally charged scene is played out between Sink and O’Brien’s characters in which an argument ensues about his character ignoring hers during a dinner party. While washing the dishes post-soiree, she expresses feeling ignored around his friends who, she points out, are all older than her.\n“A lot of age gap relationships are like that, where you’re more comfortable alone [just the two of you] than getting out with friends,” Dr. Morrison says.  When you and your partner are in different phases of life, your friends probably are too, so being around them together might shine a light on your core differences. Over time, that can take a toll. “You might spend less time with your friends because your partner is not interested in hanging out with them,” says psychologist and founder/CEO of Couples Learn, Dr. Sarah Schewitz, “So it could challenge some of your closer relationships.”\nSimilarly, psychotherapist and relationship coach Toni Coleman shared that a large age gap can cause anxiety about whether or not the younger person is “fitting in” with their partner’s friends, and can often make them feel out of place. Additionally, an older partner might have children close in age to their younger significant other, which could definitely create some discomfort for all parties involved.\nMoney can pose another problem area. “There is usually a difference in financial status, and therefore potentially [within the] power dynamic [as well],” Irina Firstein, licensed individual and couples therapist, tells Bustle. This situation could create conditions in which the partner with less expendable income has to rely on their partner often, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy or frustration. A power imbalance can manifest in other ways, too. If one partner has more relationship experience, the younger person might be less equipped to communicate their needs or work through conflict, and end up defaulting to their partner’s agenda instead.\nHow Age Gap Relationships Can Find Success\nWith the cards stacked against them, couples in age gap relationships must become master communicators. For the younger person, feeling out of place with or unaccepted by their partner’s friends or family can affect their self-esteem and make them question their place in the relationship. Older partners might also experience judgment from other people who assume they’re using the relationship for validation. “I think people need to go into these relationships with eyes wide open, and be able to discuss their fears and expectations openly and honestly,” Firstein says.\nWith any couple, it’s important to remember that “you and your partner have completely different world views because of how you were raised, and in this case when you were raised,” Dr. Schewitz says. “That way, you’re not just assuming ‘I’m right and you’re wrong.’”\nBeyond those things, there also needs to be a common understanding of the why behind the relationship — what makes the two of you click? What do you have in common? What are the ways in which you make life easier on each other? If both partners have confidence in their answers to those questions, that’s what counts at the end of the day. “ Relationships are hard enough as it is,” Dr. Morrison says, “so if you find something good and worth holding onto, regardless of the age gap, why throw it away?”\nSources:\nDr. Janet Morrison, clinical sexologist and sex & relationship coach\nDr. Sarah Schewitz, psychologist and founder/CEO of Couples Learn\nToni Coleman, psychotherapist and relationship coach\nIrina Firstein, licensed individual and couples therapist", "Timeline of Taylor Swift's Relationships\nHome Entertainment\nA Timeline Of Taylor Swift's Age-Inappropriate Romances\nAly Weisman\nDec 13, 2012, 12:28 PM\nTaylor Swift is looking for love in all the wrong places.\nEva Rinaldi Celebrity and Live Music Photography via Flickr\nToday, Taylor Swift turns 23, but you would never know how old the singer actually is based on her love life.\nFrom 18-year-old Conor Kennedy to 35-year-old John Mayer, Swift is no ageist when it comes to who she will date.\nYoung or old, British or American, Swift really doesn't discriminate in her love life.\nBut at the age of 23, Swift has already had at least ten high-profile relationships (some more flings, really) that have all ended the same way — in song.\nIn honor of her 23rd year, let's relive Swift's vast array of boyfriends, shall we?\n2008: Taylor Swift, 19 & Joe Jonas, 19\nGetty\nSwift's first Hollywood romance was perfectly age-appropriate.

Some Are Calling Her out for Dating Younger Men\nBy Joseph Allen\nNov. 19 2021, Published 10:51 a.m. ET\nIn the aftermath of \"Red (Taylor's Version),\" many fans of Taylor Swift are digging back into her relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal, which apparently inspired many of the songs on the album. One of the recurring themes of \"Red\" is that Taylor was much younger than Jake, and Jake actually used that as a wedge in their relationship. Now, some are digging into Taylor's relationship history to point out some potential hypocrisy.\nArticle continues below advertisement\nDid Taylor Swift date a 17-year-old?\nAs fans dig through Taylor's relationship history, many are noting that she has more than once dated men who were younger than she was at the time. She dated Conor Kennedy, of the famous Kennedy family, while he was 18 and still in high school. Taylor was 22 at the time, and the two met when Conor was still 17 and his mother had just died. She also purchased a house right next to his.\nSource: Getty Images\nArticle continues below advertisement\nAdditionally, Taylor dated Taylor Lautner when he was 17 and she was 20, and she dated Harry Styles when she was 23 and he was 18. So it turns out that, yes, Taylor did date a 17-year-old, although she was only 20 at the time and the relationship didn't last very long. The broader point is really that Taylor has been in relationships with age gaps where she is older, although none as severe as the eight-year gap between Taylor and Jake.\nFans argue that Taylor was overcorrecting in the aftermath of her relationship with Jake.\nSome have defended Taylor's brief relationships with younger men, two of which came around her relationship with Jake, by suggesting that she was overcorrecting after dating a much older man. Although these age gaps may make some uncomfortable, it's clear that Taylor's relationship history is worthy of examination, even if she's sometimes as much at fault as the men she dates.\nArticle continues below advertisement\nJake and Taylor have faced scrutiny following the re-release of \"Red.\"\nTaylor has certainly faced her share of scrutiny in the aftermath of the release of \"Red (Taylor's Version),\" but so has Jake. Although Jake has yet to comment on the re-released album, it has nonetheless renewed the focus on how he treated Taylor during their three-month relationship.\nSome have also pointed out that Taylor seems very worked up over a relatively short relationship.\nSource: Instagram\nArticle continues below advertisement\nUltimately, though, Taylor makes her living by writing songs that other people can relate to. She seems to feel things intensely, or at least that's what her songs suggest. Relationships are always more complicated than what a song can depict, and some may think it's unfair of her to write about her relationships without offering her partners a chance to weigh in.\nUltimately, though, Taylor and Jake have both moved on in the years since \"Red\" was first released. As devastated as she was by the relationship at the time, she seems to be in a much better place now with an age-appropriate partner. Everyone has trouble with love, and Taylor Swift knows how to write songs about that universal truth.\nAdvertisement", "How Old Was Taylor Swift When She Dated Jake Gyllenhaal?

As indicated in her hit breakup track \"Dear John\" from \"Speak Now,\" she was only 19 to John's 32. Their 13-year age gap was a spot of controversy for the pair throughout their relationship, and something she alluded to being warned about in the breakup track.\nJake and Taylor dated for only three months in late 2010, breaking up just before the new year. Taylor had just turned 21 weeks before she and Jake broke up (though he seems to have missed her party, if \"The Moment I Knew\" is truly about him).

Today, her mysterious relationship with Joe Alwyn proves Taylor has learned a major lesson in love.\nAlthough she’s just 30 years old, for close to half her life already, Taylor Swift has been capturing the hearts and minds of fans with her compelling narrative songwriting. In fact, as long as she’s been writing love songs, she’s been centring them on her personal life and her romances, and her fans have been analyzing them to figure out which real-life men they’re about.\nBut while critical acclaim and lots of media coverage are a positive when your focus is building fame, they’re not always the smartest route to building a stable, healthy relationship. Fortunately for her, Taylor has learned from her past mistakes and evolved as a human being—which means there’s still hope for the rest of us!\nTaylor wrote her first couple of albums still a teenager, so it’s not surprising that her music from this phase is a coming of age story on love and heartbreak. But, by and large, she continued this theme in the albums that followed, and it’s only recently that she has become more guarded with her personal life.\nPerhaps it was all the ugly drama of 2016, which she has since dubbed an “apocalypse” in the wake of her numerous high-profile feuds with other celebrities (including Kanye West, Katy Perry, and Nicki Minaj), that prompted Taylor to start making different choices in life and love.\nTaylor’s difficult road to a mature relationship\nTaylor Swift has had many boyfriends and romantic dalliances, some of them immortalized in song and others left to the dustbins of history.\nIn 2008, at just 18, Swift began her first high profile romance with singer Joe Jonas, which ended 3 months later when he broke up with her during a notorious 27-second phone call. Her song “Forever & Always” gets into this with thick sarcasm: “Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide / Like a scared little boy.”\nIn 2009, she briefly dated singer John Mayer, 13 years her senior, when she was just 19 and he 32. The two had collaborated on several performances, wowing audiences with their gorgeous chemistry, but unfortunately the aftermath of their breakup outlasted the relationship itself.\nTaylor’s infamous song “Dear John,” from her 2010 album Speak Now delves into this bit of bad blood like a seasoned pro. “Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong / Don’t you think nineteen is too young / To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?”\nIn response, Mayer, deeply hurt, continued their dramatic public saga with his own song “Paper Doll,” in which he describes his short-lived relationship with a “paper doll,” suggesting Swift was too emotionally immature and fragile to handle their relationship.\nA mystery man, the secret to her heart?\nFinally, after unsuccessfully merging her life with numerous other celeb beaus including actor Tom Hiddleston—with whom she also had a highly publicized breakup—she began dating her current boyfriend, English actor Joe Alwyn in 2016.\nMuch as Taylor has come to prefer, Alwyn likes to keep a lid on his media persona. He gives few interviews and does his darnedest not to discuss his relationship. While the couple are rarely photographed together, they have started going out in public a little more often.\nTaylor actually skipped the Grammys to support Alwyn at the BAFTAs, when his film The Favourite was up for several awards. In turn, he showed up to support her at the premiere of Cats in which she played a starring role. Most recently, they attended the pre-pandemic 2020 Golden Globes together. Although rumours abound about the pair’s possible engagement, a possible secret marriage, and even a hush-hush pregnancy, so far no one knows for sure—and Swift wants to keep it that way.\nFor Swift, stepping out of an adolescent mindset and into a mature relationship has meant stepping out of the limelight—just a bit. Whatever changes she’s made within, it shows, because pre-2016 she was still bogged down in songs about her exes and insult wars with fellow stars.\nToday, she finds herself in a drama-free, mutually supportive, low profile relationship. She has also accepted responsibility for her overexposed tabloid dramas, pointing out that in the past, if she didn’t wish a friend happy birthday on Instagram, there would be automatic reports of broken friendships, even if they had celebrated together.\nBecause we didn’t post about it, it didn’t happen – and I realized I had done that. I created an expectation that everything in my life that happened, people would see.\nTaylor Swift in The Guardian\nTaylor went from petty to maturity\nIt’s not as though Taylor has stopped integrating her relationships into her music and lyrics—it’s just that her relationship to relationships has evolved, and by extension, so has her music. Her album Lover, released in 2019, is very much about Alwyn.\nTaylor likens its writing to feeling like “I could take a full deep breath again.” In the track “London Boy,” she lists their favourite hangouts around the city and describes her new appreciation of watching rugby matches with him and his friends. In “Afterglow,” she asks him to forgive her anxious tendencies to jump to conclusions and assume the worst. In “Daylight,” the album’s final song, she includes a spoken word part at the end, saying, “I want to be defined by the things that I love. Not the things that I hate, not the things I’m afraid of, the things that haunt me in the middle of the night.”\nMuse though Alwyn may be for her latest love songs, their relationship is one of the only things she won’t discuss publicly these days. “I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion,” she says.\nThat’s where the boundary is, and that’s where my life has become manageable. I really want to keep it feeling manageable.\nTaking a few steps away from her showy past toward a more subtle future, she says, “I know the difference between making art and living your life like a reality star…even if it’s hard for other people to grasp, my definition is really clear.”\nAlthough some fans have worried that some of the breakup songs on her most recent album, Folklore, released in July, are about Alwyn, Swift has described how her latest songs are a combination of real life and made up characters.\nFor Elle, she writes, “There’s a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I’m really grateful to have learned this isn’t true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool.”\nFun fact: Alwyn is actually suspected to have co-written a couple of songs under the pseudonym William Bowery. Sounds like suitable a partner in crime to me! We can all shirk old habits and learn to be happy without the need for constant public appraisal and approval: Taylor Swift is a living example.\nMore inspiring celebrities:\nHere’s what Jennifer Aniston Did When Her Ex John Mayer Attacked Her\nWhy Taylor Swift Sued A Man For $1–And What We Can Learn From It\nCameron Diaz Reveals The Powerful Truth About Having A Child In Her 40s\nThe Story Behind Lady Gaga’s Most Romantic Breakup From Taylor Kinney\nTags\ninspiring\nstories\nPrev Post Next Post\nMaya Khamala", "‘All Too Well’ Has Us Asking—When Is an Age Gap Inappropriate?\n‘All Too Well’ Has Us Asking—When Is an Age Gap Inappropriate?\nJenny Singer 11/15/2021\nHouston-area deputy shot and killed during traffic stop, constable says\nInvitation\n© Getty Images\nImages of Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal from October 2010 are crystalized forever in many minds. The paparazzi snaps capture something essentially autumnal—the falling leaves, knit beanies, paper coffee cups, the new-beginning beauty of falling in love. Swift and Gyllenhaal looked like love's most photogenic representatives. They are literally picture perfect.\nShe was 20 years old. He was 29.\nSwift remembers her relationships “all too well,” as she sings in 2012 album, Red, which is widely understood to be about her relationship with Gyllenhaal. But we, the public, have a memory that warps with time.\nDuring their relationship, coverage tended to ignore the couple's age gap, or to suggest that Swift alone was responsible for it. Us Weeklynoted that Swift's boyfriend was “nearly a decade her senior.” Sounds Like Nashville featured Swift on a list of female stars who “go for the older guys.” In 2012, Business Insider published a listicle titled “A Timeline of the Age-Inappropriateness of Taylor Swift's Romances.”\nBut now, as Swift rereleases Red, including a long-awaited 10-minute version of “All Too Well,” a different narrative has emerged. Urged by Swift's choice to cast 19-year-old Sadie Sink and 30-year-old Dylan O'Brien in the “All Too Well” music video, as well as a line in the extended lyrics, fans are reexamining Swift and Gyllenhaal's relationship.

If someone has a history of consistently dating up against the age of consent, and if their partners have little in common besides that age, then there may be more to look into. Additionally, if the age of consent is being viewed more as a legal green flag than as legislation to prevent exploitation, this is a good sign that something else is amiss.

Romantic relationships are a complex exchange of power. It's really, really hard to tell what's happening in another person's relationship.

The squad appeared to dissolve during Swift's Reputation era, which left fans wondering whether Swift and her posse were no longer friends. For some of those friendships, that is the case—and Swift just explained why.\nIn a new cover essay for Elle, Swift opened up about 30 lessons she's learned in her twenties. (Swift turns 30 in December.) One big takeaway? Some of those famous squad friendships weren't so lasting.\nChristopher Polk/MTV1415\nSwift describes these as \"situationships,\" which she has since outgrown. \"Something about 'We're in our young twenties!' hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family,\" she wrote. \"And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they'll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It's sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you'll always keep the memories.\"\nSwift didn't drop names in her essay, but a glance at her social media presence can give you an idea of who she's spending time with now. She added that surrounding herself with a squad of friends came from insecurities she had as a kid.  \"Never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me,\" she explained. \"Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at.\"\nSo when the opportunity came for Swift to throw giant Fourth of July parties with a crew of models and actresses, she went for it. \"In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend,\" she wrote. \"So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone.\"\nBrian Rasic/LP5\nSwift added that she knows who her true friends (and fans) are today: \"the ones who stuck around\" during her feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and the following Reputation era. \"I learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don't care if I'm #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they're here now.\"\nThis essay is the latest entry in Swift's slow return to social media and the public eye. In recent months she's shown up at a few events, written a second essay for Elle UK 's April issue, and hinted that new music is on its way. She's also shared a few looks at her current friendships, including a hangout with Selena Gomez and Cazzie David. Fans are confident that this return to social media and the public eye all point to a new album and era for Swift—but if her essay is to be believed, the resurrection of the Swift squad won't come with it.", "Why Didn’t We Think She Was Too Young? | NEXT Magazine\nMusic /Features\nWhy Didn’t We Think She Was Too Young?\nIn her new short film and expanded album, Taylor Swift points the finger at her audience.\nBy: Rayne Fisher-Quann\nWhen Taylor Swift recounted her ill-fated relationship with John Mayer on 2010 track Dear John, she repeated the same question again and again with pleading sincerity: “Don’t you think I was too young?”\nShe was 19 when she dated Mayer, who was 32 at the time. He, by all accounts, treated her terribly, which isn’t out of character — he has a long and storied history of being the fucking worst to pretty much everyone. But despite his proclivity for racial slurs and speaking his mind when it came to women’s bodies, he’s always stayed conspicuously quiet when prodded about the age gap in his relationship with the teenage Swift. Outside of a few songs, she’s avoided speaking explicitly on her several age-imbalanced relationships, too — for most of her career, the media frenzy around her relationships barely let her get a word in at all.\nBut Swift is on an empowerment kick: This week, she released Red (Taylor’s Version) as part of her ongoing plan to re-record and re-imagine the albums she made while under predatory contract. There’s no mention of Mayer on this album — by the time Red was released in 2012, the main man in her life was 30-year-old Jake Gyllenhaal. Much of the original album was dedicated to their disastrous three-month love affair, but it’s only in the re-release that she explores the consequences of their nine-year age gap. The crown jewel of the album, in fact, is an expanded 10-minute version of her cult-classic sleeper hit All Too Well, drawn from the original verses she penned when writing the song for the first time.\nIt’s in this track where it becomes clear that the themes she first wrote about in Dear John didn’t leave when he did. “You said if we were closer in age maybe it would have been fine, and that made me want to die,” she writes, followed by: “I was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes: I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age.”\n(This 10-year-old barb is as accurate as it was biting: 40-year-old Gyllenhaal started dating his current girlfriend when she was 21. In the most please-don’t-sue-me way possible, I hope he chokes!)\nOn Friday, she released a debut short film to accompany All Too Well (Ten-Minute Version) starring Stranger Things star Sadie Sink and 2000s-indie-boy Dylan O’Brien. Those casting choices are meticulous, razor-sharp and pointed — they tell a story as effectively as the song itself. Sink is best known for playing honest-to-God children, and most people actually think of her as much younger than she actually is (there was a brief online outcry after the short film’s release from people who were convinced she was still a legal minor).\nOn the other hand, O’Brien’s age is made all the more apparent by the fact that he was at his peak almost a decade ago, playing teenage characters in Teen Wolf and Maze Runner. When the casting was announced, I was confused — I wondered if they were somehow playing siblings, or maybe a teacher and student? — but their 11-year age gap is only two years wider than Swift and Gyllenhaal’s, and Sink is only a year younger than Swift was at the time. The difference is that, unlike Swift throughout her most difficult years, Sink is perceived by us as the teenager that she is.\nSwift, who wrote and directed the film, throws this injustice in our face. Physicality between the actors is constant, bordering on excessive: The first time they touch, I physically flinch as hard as if I was watching a slasher flick. A 20-second makeout shot feels so viscerally wrong that I have to close my eyes. I don’t exaggerate when I say that their on-screen relationship is genuinely gut-churning to watch: Rosy-cheeked, messy-haired Sink is so obviously a child, O’Brien so clearly a man. It feels — in some ways accurately — like we are watching a crime unfold before our eyes.\nWhen they argue (with writing so sharp and realistic that it seems as though Swift must have pulled it directly from a decade-old diary), the glaring age gap makes it seem ridiculous: “She’s a child!” you think! “She is so obviously a child!”\nThe irony here, of course, is that the world saved its righteous anger until 10 years too late. When Swift was a young girl suddenly thrust into the biggest spotlight in the world, nobody passed judgment on the revolving door of men twice her age who lined up to claim her like a trophy. Instead, she was a slut, a serial dater, a crazy bitch — and when her dating life was the butt of a universal cultural joke, nobody even considered that she could be a victim. Instead, blonde, icy-eyed Swift (ripe for the projection from insecure men and girls who were unpopular in high school) was made out to be the Jezebelian villain everyone wanted her to be.\nAccording to the tabloids, men lived in fear of her scathing, lust-crazed pen; she was cruel, insane, heartless! “Won’t anyone think of John Mayer???” wept the masses!\nSwift — tall, thin and strikingly gorgeous — was a perfectly cast evil queen for the tabloid circus. It’s important to note, though, that even as the media’s sexism attacked her from all sides, her saving grace was always her whiteness (notably, many outlets mysteriously rushed to her defence once she was pitted against Kanye West instead of a white man). Along the axis of race, she was a perpetual victim; in her romantic relationships, she was conniving, hysterical and manipulative. Even as she was pursued by some of the most powerful men in Hollywood, she was somehow always painted as the aggressor instead (as if the occasional petty country song was a comparable weapon to the systems of patriarchy and rape culture).\nIn recent years, countless people have changed their minds on Swift; one of the surprising benefits of her re-release project is that people who wrote her off during the early 2010s are suddenly realizing that her music was always pretty great. Projects like Red, though, do more than re-introduce her music to the world: they also force her perspective on the relationships of her youth back into the public eye.\nAs she’s gradually gained control of her narrative, we’ve spent the last few years witnessing the Taylor Swift Redemption Arc — but like redemption arcs of its ilk, there is no true catharsis in realizing that we spent years cannibalizing a young woman to feed our insatiable cultural appetite.\nUnlike Britney or Alanis, however, Swift is choosing to artistically hold her audience accountable for some of what it did before her redemption began. Through All Too Well: The Short Film, she points the finger at us: she lays the truth out on the table, waving it in front of our faces, wondering why we didn’t see it sooner.\nWith every stomach-churning scene between her fictionalized self and the older man wearing her down, Swift is forcing her audience to realize now what they never could while these relationships were actually happening. With fire and fury, with palpable rage, she repeats the question she first asked over a decade ago: “Don’t you think I was too young?”\nNEXT", "‘All Too Well’ Has Us Asking—When Is an Age Gap Inappropriate? | Glamour\nPop Culture\n‘All Too Well’ Has Us Asking—When Is an Age Gap Inappropriate?\nThe Red revival is causing a reckoning bigger than just Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal.\nBy Jenny Singer\nNovember 15, 2021\nGetty Images\nImages of Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal from October 2010 are crystalized forever in many minds. The paparazzi snaps capture something essentially autumnal—the falling leaves, knit beanies, paper coffee cups, the new-beginning beauty of falling in love. Swift and Gyllenhaal looked like love's most photogenic representatives. They are literally picture perfect.\nShe was 20 years old. He was 29.\nSwift remembers her relationships “all too well,” as she sings in 2012 album, Red, which is widely understood to be about her relationship with Gyllenhaal. But we, the public, have a memory that warps with time.\nDuring their relationship, coverage tended to ignore the couple's age gap, or to suggest that Swift alone was responsible for it. Us Weekly noted that Swift's boyfriend was “nearly a decade her senior.” Sounds Like Nashville featured Swift on a list of female stars who “go for the older guys.” In 2012, Business Insider published a listicle titled “A Timeline of the Age-Inappropriateness of Taylor Swift's Romances.”\nBut now, as Swift rereleases Red, including a long-awaited 10-minute version of “All Too Well,” a different narrative has emerged. Urged by Swift's choice to cast 19-year-old Sadie Sink and 30-year-old Dylan O'Brien in the “All Too Well” music video, as well as a line in the extended lyrics, fans are reexamining Swift and Gyllenhaal's relationship. (“You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would have been fine / And that made me want to die,” Swift sings.)

But is her cynicism really the mark of that evolution?\nBy Molly Flynn, University of North Carolina at Charlotte\nI’ve always identified with music and songwriting. When I was a young and hyperemotional tweenaged girl, I would look to the pen and paper to express my feelings of heartache over silly little twelve-year-old boys who liked my sister better than me. I still, to this day, have notebooks piled high of documented embarrassing crushes—yikes. So, being a self-proclaimed songwriter, I idolized Taylor Swift, who seemed to understand exactly what I was experiencing as I navigated my way through discovering what love meant.\nImage via Pop Crush\nI related so intimately to Taylor’s music that I had a boy that came to mind when listening to “Teardrops on My Guitar,” and the only thing that was different about my crush and the boy in “Hey Stephen” was the name. When I went through my first break up, “White Horse” was my anthem, and when my best friend got pregnant at 14, I ached with the song “Fifteen” and could feel the lyrics pressing into my soul. It’s encouraging to have someone understand you when you’re growing up and speak to the struggles you’re facing. For me, Taylor Swift was that encourager.\nAnd like me, Taylor Swift grew up. In many ways, this is a very good thing. I left those old silly crushes behind, learned to be much more independent and—praise the lord—I no longer own corduroy pants. Taylor has also gone through some important changes, too. Her style has matured, her lyrics have become deeper and she totally rocks the bob! However, her portrayal of love has also drastically changed. With her most recent album, “1989,” the public and media were concerned with her transition from the traditional “country” genre and into an era of pop, but my concern was less with stylistic choices and more with the ideology behind her music.\nTaylor pioneered through different albums like “Speak Now” and “Fearless,” but as she approached her album “Red,” a change began in the way she spoke about love. In her earlier childish music, Swift romanticized love and break-ups. Heartache was a beautiful melody that connected her to her listeners. I remember when I was a freshman in high school, and my first boyfriend broke up with me at my house while my family had a huge group of friends over. I snuck up to the flat roof of my country home and looked at the vast sky speckled with stars.\nYou might also like:\nWhy You Shouldn’t Judge an Album by Its Cover\nWhile I was sad, I was also existentially connected to Taylor Swift. She knew this feeling and was able to help me savor the emotion of heartache, because when your heart is broken, you know that the vulnerability you exchanged in the relationship had the potential of turning into love. However, as “Red” was released, vulnerability transformed from a quality Taylor cherished into one that she rejected. She became more of a realist in her lyrics, proclaiming that “We are never ever ever getting back together” and exposing her foolishness in the anthem “I Knew you Were Trouble.” Love, to Taylor, became synonymous with recklessness and treachery.\nAnother important change that began to reveal itself in “Red” was Taylor’s changing ideology around the concept of forever. In the past, she believed in the permanence of love, but with her coming-of-age album, she lost the belief in love’s longevity.\nIn her song “Never Getting Back Together,” Taylor proclaimed this worldview with her lyric, “I used to think that we were forever and ever.” No longer did Taylor believe in forever and ever.\nWhile we started seeing the change in the “Red” album, Taylor’s cynical worldview really came to fruition in the “1989” album. No longer did she write songs about the cute boy driving her around the small town in his truck. Her lyrics became darker, dirtier, more sensual. She became less concerned about love and more concerned with lust and temporality. When I first heard her new album, I was going through a break up, just as I was four years before on my star-spangled rooftop. But her songs this time, rather than encourage me that love would find me again, promised me that love was overrated and eternally painful. Heartache was no longer a necessary part of love, but rather a foolish part of ignorance.\nWhile “Red” began to question the idea of forever, “1989” completely threw it away. In “ Wildest Dreams ,” Taylor didn’t think the relationship in question was going to last—in fact, there was never an intention of the relationship lasting. In her first verse she proclaimed, “Nothing lasts forever.” In the bridge, she continued with the theme, saying, “Someday when you leave me.” It makes sense in this particular song that forever is not an option, because in the music video, it is revealed that this man who she is tangled up with all night is married. Not only has Taylor entered into a world of love being temporary, but also of marriage being moot.\nYou might also like:\nTaylor Swift and the Songs That Led Her to Her ‘Lover,’ Joe Alwyn\nImage via CBS News\nHowever, “Wildest Dreams” is not the most cynical of her newer songs. In her song “Blank Space,” Taylor revealed her newfound ideology of love. There is a stark contrast between her earlier lyrics and some of the lyrics in this song like, “You look like my next mistake. Love’s a game. Wanna play?” Rather than embracing heartbreak, love and true emotion, Taylor rejected these feelings and traded them for a shallow replacement. She continued her cynical rant in this song through positing, “Boys only want love if its torture,” and “I’m dying to see how this one ends.” No more teardrops for Taylor, only making bad boys good for a weekend.\nLet me clarify: This is not written out of animosity towards T. I love her, and I secretly know all the words to all of her songs—even the not-so-great ones about love. And this is not to caution you against listening to her music—seriously, who doesn’t like to shake it off every now and then? But, as she has grown up, she has compromised her innocent understanding of and giddiness toward love.\nSome people might argue that this is inevitable as we age. That cute boy who wrote love notes in your seventh grade science class is now a lot taller and also a lot less inclined to write us a sappy note. He might swipe right on Tinder and buy us a drink, but let’s be honest, he probably won’t be asking us to the dance any time soon.\nYou might also like:\nHow Pizza Points to a Collab Between Taylor Swift and the Jonas Brothers\nHow do we then transition from a time in which we over-romanticized love to a time in which we condemn it outright? Should we follow in Taylor’s footsteps and stop believing in forever? I don’t think the answer is that simple. I do believe, however, that Taylor might not be on the right track—not the platinum-award-winning track, but the track to truly finding love.\nWhy should we care about Taylor’s evolution from romantic to cynic? I am not claiming to believe in indoctrination theory or the idea of the hypodermic needle, because I don’t think it’s that linear. Watching one aggressive television show won’t make you an aggressive individual, just like listening to one T Swift tune from her newer albums won’t make you a cynic about love; but, I do believe it is important to critically engage with the messages we expose ourselves to—especially messages around fundamental things like love.\nWhile Taylor Swift might be great to jam to every now and then, I will no longer be using her music for relationship education. I do still believe in forever and I do still believe in marriage and while I wish Taylor and I could be “Forever & Always.”\nMajor\nPublic Relations\nSocial Media\nFacebook Comments"]}

For example, annual global waste arising from waste electrical and electronic equipment alone will have increased from 33.8 to 49.8 million tonnes between 2010 and 2018. Despite incineration and other waste treatment techniques, landfill still dominates waste disposal in low-income and middle-income countries. There is usually insufficient funding for adequate waste management in these countries and uptake of more advanced waste treatment technologies is poor. Without proper management, many landfills represent serious hazards as typified by the landslide in Shenzhen, China on 20 December 2015. In addition to formal waste recycling systems, approximately 15million people around the world are involved in informal waste recycling, mainly for plastics, metals, glass and paper. This review examines emerging public health challenges, in particular within low-income and middle-income countries, associated with the informal sector. While informal recyclers contribute to waste recycling and reuse, the relatively primitive techniques they employ, combined with improper management of secondary pollutants, exacerbate environmental pollution of air, soil and water. Even worse, insufficient occupational health measures expose informal waste workers to a range of pollutants, injuries, respiratory and dermatological problems, infections and other serious health issues that contribute to low life expectancy. Integration of the informal sector with its formal counterparts could improve waste management while addressing these serious health and livelihood issues. Progress in this direction has already been made notably in several Latin American countries where integrating the informal and formal sectors has had a positive influence on both waste management and poverty alleviation.\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech-2016-208597\nStatistics from Altmetric.com\nSee more details\nReferenced in 3 policy sources\nTweeted by 7\n284 readers on Mendeley\nRequest Permissions\nIntroduction\nWith rapidly increasing populations and unprecedented urbanisation rates, waste generation is growing rapidly, particularly in cities and especially in low-income and middle-income countries. Effective waste management, especially of toxic material, is a major challenge for global sustainable development. 1 A range of methods are available for the disposal or treatment of waste including landfill, incineration, composting and recycling. Landfill remains the most widely used approach in the low-income and middle-income world due to its low cost. However, improper management can result in major health and environmental problems. Particular emerging hazards are dangerous and poorly managed landfill slides. 2 For example, management failures led to the collapse of a landfill in Shenzhen, China on 20 December 2015 that killed 73 people. 3 4 A similar collapse in Bandung, Java, Indonesia, in February 2005 was responsible for 140 deaths. 5\nThe formal, government-funded, sector is responsible for most waste collection and treatment services in high-income countries. However, in many low-income and middle-income nations limited resources means that the formal sector cannot keep pace with rapid expansion of waste production. The informal sector (the so-called waste pickers and scavengers in some countries) has grown as a result. Informal waste recyclers collect, transport and trade waste in almost all low-income and middle-income countries. 6 It is estimated that the informal waste sector supports around 15 million people, particularly within large and relatively wealthy cities. 7\nInformal waste recyclers are subsistence workers using relatively primitive technologies to process and recycle a wide variety of waste material from food waste to heavy metals. They can play a key role in recycling material but poor regulation often results in increased environmental pollution through release of an array of secondary pollutants. 8 Insufficient occupational health exposes informal waste recyclers to a host of health damaging factors. 4 With rapid urbanisation and the diversification of waste, especially waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), health risks facing informal waste recyclers from toxins is increasing. These concerns are exemplified by growing health-related problems facing waste workers in Guiyu, South China, the so-called ‘electronics graveyard of the world’. 9\nSome studies of informal waste recyclers 10–12 and WEEE 13–15 have been undertaken while plastic waste pollution, particularly microplastics, have received more attention recently. 16 17 The current study focuses on important emerging public health challenges facing informal recyclers, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. It also outlines the future challenges for the informal waste sector.\nIncreasing waste production with growing populations and expanding urbanisation\nWaste is continuously generated by human activities. Sources of solid waste include industry, construction, commerce, the services and domestic sectors and individual households. The nature of the waste generated will vary from location to location and through time in response to the dominant human activities taking place. It is estimated that globally approximately 11 billion tonnes of solid waste were produced in 2011. 18 Increasing populations, rapid urbanisation and economic development in low-income and middle-income countries mean that waste production is increasing at an unparalleled rate. China and India are the most populous low-income and middle-income countries and waste problems in their urban and periurban areas are among the most acute. Municipal solid waste frequently exceeds society’s capacity for safe management. 19 Expanding urban infrastructure, for example, roads, bridges and rapid transport systems are generating increasing volumes of construction and demolish wastes (CDW). For example, 87 000 m 3 of CDW was produced during construction of Futian station, Asia’s largest underground station, in Shenzhen, China, the city where the calamitous landfill slide occurred in 2015. 3\nRapid development of information and communications technology 17 means that, globally, WEEE is one of the fastest growing wastes. 20 In 2014, around 42 million tonnes of WEEE was generated worldwide. 21 Despite low average per capita WEEE generation of only 3.7 kg/year, Asia was the largest continental contributor, accounting for nearly 38% of global WEEE (16 million tonnes in 2014). While between 2010 and 2018 the global population is projected to have increased by around 8%, total and per capita WEEE generation are set to grow by approximately 47% and 34%, respectively (figure 1 ). 21 The severity of problems associated with WEEE disposal is creating both governmental and the public concern around the world.\nDownload figure\nOpen in new tab\nDownload powerpoint\nFigure 1\nIncreasing global production (total and per capita) of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and human population: 2010–2018. Data are from Baldé et al.21\nAn additional concern is overuse of plastics and resulting plastic waste. Worldwide plastics and polymer consumption has grown at an average rate of 10% per year since the 1990s. 17 Rates of increase are particularly large in low-income and middle-income economies. Approximately 275 million tonnes of plastic waste was generated in global coastal cities in 2010 with China contributing >25% of this total. 16 It is estimated that between 4.8 and 12.7 million tonnes entered the ocean in 2010. Without improvements in waste management, generation of plastic waste is expected to grow by an order of magnitude by 2025. Risks associated with plastic waste, especially microplastics (plastic debris <5 mm diameter), to marine wildlife and human health are growing concerns among researchers and the public alike. 22\nInformal waste recycling\nLack of funding within rapidly expanding cities of many low-income and middle-income countries results in extensive informal waste recycling. In contrast to the formal sector, informal waste recycling is undertaken without government financial support and may not be recognised by the public as providing a valuable service. 23\nIn common with formal waste management, the informal sector comprises players at the different stages of waste recycling (figure 2 ). 17 For example, waste pickers choose and collect valuable items from locally sourced household, commercial and industrial waste or from waste imported from overseas. These waste pickers form the base of the informal waste sector (figure 2) and are characteristically from poor, disadvantaged, vulnerable and/or marginalised social groups. 17 They are characterised by low levels of organisation, technology and capital, as well as non-compliance to rules and regulations related to tax, minimum wages, workers safety and environmental protection. Although informal waste recycling is not usually recognised as a legal occupation in many countries, it provides large societal benefits in terms of waste management and lessening pressure on resources used in the production of material goods. 24\nDownload figure\nOpen in new tab\nDownload powerpoint\nFigure 2\nInvolvement of informal waste recyclers in waste management. Informal waste collectors sort and collect valuable waste from industry, the commercial and service sectors, households, imported waste and landfill sites. Sorted waste is transported and sold to both government-funded and non-government-funded transfer stations. In non-government-funded transfer stations, informal waste recyclers further sort waste and identify and extract valuable recyclable material. Modified from Ojeda-Benitez et al. 49\nOf the estimated that >15 million people involved in informal waste recycling, mostly are in low-income and middle-income countries. 7 China has the largest number 11 25 and between 0.6% and 0.9% of the urban population, or 3.3–5.6 million people, are involved in informal waste collection and recycling activities in Chinese cities. 11 In Shanghai alone, the informal recycling sector involves nearly 2 00 000 people and accounts for 17%–38% of municipal recycling activities.\nMaterials recycled by informal waste recyclers\nAlthough there are variations between regions and countries, materials most frequently recycled by the informal sector are paper and cardboard, scrap metal (especially aluminium, steel, tin), glass, plastic (polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) bottles, rubber, wood, textiles and food waste. 6 Metal, paper and PET are usually preferred due to their large recycling potential and long life spans.\nWEEE makes up a growing proportion of waste recycled by the informal sector due to the potentially high value of materials that can be recovered. However, recycling methods and poor occupational health means that WEEE poses some of the largest health risks to informal recyclers. 13 Informal WEEE recycling activities are widespread and are undertaken in many places around the world, although toxic exposure patterns vary according to recycling methods and processes. A notorious example of informal WEEE recycling is Guiyu, an agglomerate of four villages in Guangdong, South China (figure 3A ). Since 1995, nearly 6000 family workshops have processed approximately 1.6 million tonnes of WEEE annually. 9 26 Guiyu has become the world’s largest WEEE dismantling and recycling site. Workers manually break open electronics and strip away parts for reuse including chips and valuable metals (figure 3B, C ). Workers ‘cook’ circuit boards to remove chips and burn wires and other plastics to liberate metals such as copper. Highly dangerous acid baths are used along the riverbanks to extract gold from microchips (figure 3D ).\nDownload figure\nOpen in new tab\nDownload powerpoint\nFigure 3\nInformal waste recyclers working on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and associated environmental and health risks in Guiyu, China.

In many cities, for example, Delhi and Beijing, waste plastic trading is well established with many processing units. 17 However, most of this plastic is recycled in a crude manner by informal setups. Elements such as heavy metals, bromine and antimony are added to polymers as pigments, fillers, UV stabilisers and flame retardants. 17 Inappropriate recycling of plastic waste risks contamination by such additives.\nEnvironmental pollution\nCrude methods with insufficient environmental protection can generate secondary pollutants. Environmental pollution from informal waste recycling is diverse in toxicants and levels of exposure, contaminating air, water and soil. 27–29 Contamination is widespread and can reach extremely high levels near to informal recycling sites. Toxic heavy metals, for example, lead (Pb) and chromium (Cr), and persistent organic pollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and brominated flame retardants are common contaminants. 13\nIn Agbogbloshie, a WEEE processing site in Accra, Ghana, the average soil concentrations of Pb (953.21 mg/kg), Cr (296.60 mg/kg), barium (Ba) (627.66 mg/kg) and copper (Cu) (1387.96 mg/kg) far exceed regulatory limits, for example, the worldwide accepted Dutch and Canadian standards. 30 Similarly, in Mandoli, Delhi, India, concentrations of heavy metals, particularly Cu (115.50 mg/kg), Pb (2645.31 mg/kg) and zinc (Zn) (776.84 mg/kg), in surface soil of WEEE recycling sites were much higher than those in reference sites. 31 Concentrations of total monobrominated to heptabrominated diphenyl ether homologues in soils near WEEE dumping sites in Guiyu, China, were 1140 and 1169 µg/kg dry wt, approximately 10–60 times higher than in any other contaminated sites. 14 Cu, Pb and Zn were the most abundant metals and their concentrations exceeded the new Dutch list action values of 190 mg/kg at most sites (table 1 ). 14 This environmental pollution has drawn wide attention and Guiyu has been selected as one of China’s first pilot circular-economy sites to mitigate contamination and improve WEEE recycling. 32\nView inline\nView popup\nTable 1\nAverage concentrations of heavy metal samples collected from Guiyu, South China (unit: mg/kg)\nHealth issues\nA wide range of health issues confronts those involved in the informal waste sector (table 2 ). Working on waste dumps and landfill sites is inherently dangerous and there are frequent accidents including fires, explosions and, as at Shenzhen, debris slides. 4 Most informal waste recyclers do not wear protective equipment such as gloves and boots because of their relatively high costs and lack of risk awareness. Recyclers often prefer to work barehanded for greater tactility but risk sharp trauma 7 especially from glass and hospital waste containing syringes (table 3 ). 24 33 Pickers are often in direct contact with toxic materials as well as human/animal wastes.\nView inline\nView popup\nTable 2\nKey health hazards for informal recycler communities\nView inline\nView popup\nTable 3\nSymptom/health concerns and the causes of cuts/other injuries reported in a survey of informal waste recyclers in Bangkok, Thailand\nHealth risks to informal waste workers and their families associated with heavy metals have drawn particular attention. High blood concentrations of lead have been found in recyclers working in landfills. 34 35 Lead and dioxin-related compounds have been discovered in higher concentrations within the breast milk of female waste recyclers. 36 Children and developing fetuses are particularly susceptible to heavy metal effects (figure 3E ). For example, the stillbirth rate in Guiyu was 4.6 times that of control sites, while blood lead concentrations in neonates were 4.8 times the control. 9 Exposure to hazardous plastic additives including brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and heavy metals are all implicated in nervous and reproductive system problems, behavioural changes and cancer. 37\nInformal waste workers are also prone to inhaling gaseous emissions, bioaerosols and microorganisms (ie, automobile fumes, dust, and fungal spores). Waste pickers in landfills can be exposed to gas emissions including methane (CH 4) and hydrogen sulfate (H 2 S), as well as vehicular emissions, 38 causing respiratory, dermatological and eye problems. 24 They are also more prone to common illnesses (influenza, bronchitis, ulcers and others), musculoskeletal difficulties and vermin transmitted disease. 33 39\nInsanitary working conditions and lack of washing facilities mean that informal waste recyclers can transport toxic materials to their homes and families. 33 40 Waste dumps and landfills are breeding grounds for pathogenic organisms responsible for dengue, leishmaniasis, diarrhoea, typhoid, anthrax, cholera, malaria and a variety of skin disorders (table 2 ).\nIn addition, most informal waste workers and their families are marginalised and suffer social exclusion. 7 Coupled with financial insecurity, perceived shame and humiliation, this can lead to severe psychological damage 7 which in turn has wide-ranging implications for the local communities.\nMeasures to improve the well-being of informal waste recyclers\nThere is a range of policy, economic and industrial hygiene measures that can improve the well-being of informal recyclers. Green chemistry, improved recyclability of products and the removal of toxicants before recycling are fundamentally important. 41 Poverty alleviation through adequate funding of the services provided by informal recyclers is a necessity. Hence, modernising waste management systems will need to increasingly consider informal waste systems. 11\nProper landfill management is important to prevent scavengers accessing toxic waste sites. In addition, new low-cost technologies developed to minimise health risks during waste recycling need to be adopted by the informal sector. An example is salt water floatation for separating plastics containing toxic BFRs. 42 Governmental or NGO funding can provide equipment such as battery-driven handcarts, hand tools, safety wear and uniforms. 43 Uniforms and ID cards formalise the appearance of informal workers and thereby foster a better relationship with the public that can build self-confidence and self-esteem among informal workers. 33\nGovernment training of informal sector workers can provide more professional recycling knowledge, such as standardised classification and processing methods for different waste, the laws and regulations concerning recycling and development plans for recycling systems. In China, relevant new regulations and laws have been implemented. For example, the Law on Circular Economy Promotion (effective from 1 January 2009) includes a legal framework for waste reduction, reuse and recycling while China’s new Environmental Protection Law also highlights waste management. 44 In July 2017, China released regulations to gradually stop importing soild wastes, especially WEEE. Strict enforcement of such laws and regulations by both formal and informal recyclers will be indispensable in improving waste recycling and protecting workers. 45\nThe creation of cooperatives and associations by informal recyclers has proven to be effective. The strengthening of these cooperatives and group networks can facilitate transfer of knowledge regarding proper waste handling and processing, related regulations and laws, environmental protection, sanitation, hygiene and health. 7 Such cooperatives also legitimise the work as a public service, allowing social programmes, such as extended healthcare and childcare, to be funded. In some countries, these cooperatives have combined into larger regional or national movements. 46 In Pune, India, Solid Waste Collection and Handling (SWaCH), a cooperative of approximately 1500 waste pickers, serves 2 00 000 households. 43 In Brazil, Coopamare is one of the most successful cooperatives 47 and the country has one of the largest and best established national movements of waste pickers. 6 46\nThere are characteristically more women than men working in the informal recycling sector. Support for the sector should, therefore, reflect this gender imbalance. For example, Women in Informal Employment: Globalising and Organising (WIEGO), is a global action research-policy network and waste picker support organisation focused on women in the informal waste sector. 46 WIEGO has been actively involved in the First World Conference of Waste Pickers (2008), the Third Latin American Conference of Waste Pickers (2008) and the National Day of the Waste Picker in Colombia (since 2008).\nCollaboration between informal and formal sectors\nEfforts have been made to integrate the formal and informal waste sectors. Effective integration can increase recycling rates, improve livelihoods and occupational and environmental health as well as reducing waste management costs. Research in Brazil, Egypt and India has demonstrated that integration can increase informal sector revenues and reduce total waste system costs for the formal sector. 43 A study of the state-of-the-art ‘InteRa’ model for integrating the informal sector within waste management systems in low-income and middle-income countries found similar win-win outcomes. 48 Successful development of integrated systems requires involvement of a wide variety of stakeholders beyond the formal and informal waste management sectors including federal, state and local governments, environment/development agencies and NGOs, academics and financial institutions. 47 49\nChallenges and future research\nImproving the health of those involved in the informal waste sector is a major challenge. International collaboration, for example, through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), will be vital for improving waste management, including addressing environmental pollution problems, and for enhancing well-being of informal waste recyclers. While there are promising schemes for integrating the informal sector with formal waste management, especially in Latin America, 43 these are still in their infancy in many countries. Probably, the biggest challenges are to raise awareness of the issues facing the informal sector and to change attitudes to waste pickers in many traditional cultures. Governments and the media need to acknowledge the often vital contribution the informal sector can make to waste recycling. Changed attitudes would contribute to establishing support schemes for workers, better integration of informal workers in waste management and establishing professional informal sector recycling enterprises. 43\nCurrent regulatory trends and capital investments pave the way for large recycling firms to operate. One result is that small players become excluded from the industry. Increasing pressure for automation and updated sorting techniques make it much more difficult for small enterprises to compete and informal workers are excluded from waste sites. There are clear health and safety benefits but displaced informal workers need to be either incorporated into new business schemes or be compensated to help alleviate poverty. Waste management decisions should also take into account who would most benefit from the revenues from recyclables and how to improve disposal of non-recyclable, often toxic, material. 11 High market prices can boost incentives for informal recycling and increase collection rates of recyclable material, while also benefiting the livelihoods of many individuals through employment. Conversely, low prices are challenging for informal waste recyclers.\nConclusions\nWith increasing populations and economic development, the quantity of waste being generated is rapidly increasing, creating an array of management and environmental issues. In many low-income and middle-income nations, insufficient funding for the formal waste sector means that globally around 15 million informal waste workers sort, collect, transport and trade waste. This informal sector makes major contributions to waste recycling and reuse. Heavy metals, plastic and paper are the main targets for informal waste recyclers. Unfortunately, relatively primitive recycling methods are responsible for major environmental pollution and human health problems. Some efforts have been made to integrate the informal waste sector with the formal sector, especially in Latin America. However, in many countries, the informal sector is still regarded as undesirable and often a nuisance despite the services it provides. Raising awareness of the valuable contributions made by the informal sector and changing public attitudes to those involved is needed. International collaboration, for example, through the SDGs, will be indispensable for improving waste management and the well-being of those participating in informal waste recycling.\nWhat is already known on this subject\nWith expanding population and urbanisation, global waste generation is increasingly rapidly.\nDespite limited support from many governments in developing countries, informal waste recyclers make great contributions to urban waste collection and recycling.\nWithout proper environmental protection, informal waste recycling, for example of toxic WEEE, pollutes water, soil and the atmosphere.\nWith little occupational protection, informal waste recyclers are impacted by many serious health hazards.\nWhat this study adds\nRates of WEEE and plastic waste generation are increasing very rapidly so urgent measures are needed to reduce usage of plastic and promote safe recycling of WEEE.\nGreen chemistry and low-cost technologies can increase recycling efficiency and reduce the health risks to informal recyclers.\nEffective integration of the informal sector within waste management systems can optimise waste recycling and improve the health and welfare of informal recyclers.\nCollaborations between the private, public, government and NGO sectors is essential for minimising the environmental and health risks of informal recycling.\nReferences\n↵\nHoornweg D,\nBhada-Tata P,\nKennedy C\n.

Significant human health and environmental impacts may occur because of such practices. Literature on metal(loid)s pollution during E-waste processing is fragmented. Here, I review the health and environmental impacts of E-waste recycling operations and transport pathways of metal(loid)s, dispersed during operations. This paper is organised into five sections. Section 1 relates to the background of global E-waste generation and legal/illegal trade, citing specific cases from Ghana and other developing nations. Section 2 provides a brief information on sources of metal(loid)s in E-waste. Section 3 describes characteristics of informal E-waste recycling operations in developing nations. Section 4 examines the health and environmental impacts in E-waste recycling while section 5 evaluates major transport pathways of metal(loid)s contaminants.\nIntroduction\nE-waste is the generic name for electronic wastes, which includes discarded electronic devices or broken electronic or electrical items (Widmer et al. 2005 ). Sources of E-waste include appliances such as televisions, personal computers, telephones, mobile phones, fax machines and photocopiers. While E-waste contains hazardous elements such as chromium, cadmium, mercury and lead, it is also considered a rich secondary source of metals including aluminum, iron, copper, zinc, palladium, platinum and gold. E-waste generation is staggering worldwide. For example, in 2006, global E-waste generation was estimated to be around 20–25 million tonnes per year in 2006 with most E-waste production regions in Europe, the USA and Australasia (Petranikova 2008; Robinson 2009 ). In Europe, about 8 million tonnes are generated annually, with annual increases of 3–5% (Drechse 2006 ). In the USA alone, 11.7 million tonnes of E-waste was generated in 2014 (Baldé et al. 2015 ). In Australasia, E-waste generation was estimated to be around 106,000 tonnes in 2007–2008, and is projected to reach 181,000 tonnes by 2027–2028 (Khaliq et al. 2014 ). China, Japan and India lead in absolute E-waste generation in Asia with 6, 2.2 and 1.7 Mt, respectively, in 2014 (Baldé et al. 2015 ). Advances in technology, rapid economic growth, urbanization and innovative marketing strategies have contributed to growing demand for consumer goods resulting in high production and consumption of electrical and electronic goods (Babu et al. 2007 ). High costs of labour, lack of recycling facilities and strict environmental laws have facilitated the export of E-waste from rich and developed nations to poor and developing countries (Iqbal et al. 2015 ). Consequently, old waste electrical and electronic goods are exported to developing countries to “bridge the digital divide” and satisfy demand for cheap second-hand electrical and electronic equipment (Prakash et al. 2010 ). Emerging economies and developing countries plagued by large volumes of legal and illegal imports of E-waste include China, India, Brazil, Ghana and Nigeria (Wu et al. 2015; Jun-Hui and Hang 2009; Otsuka et al. 2012 ). For example, it is estimated that about 25–75% of second-hand goods exported to Africa are broken and cannot be reused (Herten 2008 ). Significant increases in E-waste generation have not led to improved collection, recycling or reuse (Kahhat et al. 2008 ). For example, in the USA, it is estimated in 2002 that 20–24 million obsolete computers and TVs were added to storage rather than being disposed and recycled (Ongondo et al. 2011 ), while about 50–80% of total outputs of E-waste collected for recycling were exported rather than treated locally (Puckett and Smith 2002; Lepawsky 2015 ). The Basel Convention is the key international legislation regulating the trade of E-waste between Annex VII countries (made up of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), European Commission (EC), Lichtenstein) and non-annex VII countries (all other signatories) (Lepawsky 2015 ). Under the Basel Convention, E-waste labelled as reusable is allowed for export. The USA for instance has neither signed the Basel Convention nor ratified the Basel Ban Amendment which prohibits all forms of export of hazardous waste from rich countries to poor countries including for recycling. Under the USA’s own laws, it is legal to export all forms of E-waste including cathode ray tubes (CRTs) which the USEPA has listed as hazardous waste (Man et al. 2013 ). A “loophole” thus exists in the Basel Convention, which is often exploited by some developed countries. Inadequate national regulations and/or lax enforcement of existing laws on disposal and recycling in developing countries has also contributed to the growth of semi-formal and informal industries around trading, repairing and recovering materials from redundant electronic devices (Widmer et al. 2005 ). Some developed countries including Switzerland are one of the first countries to promulgate WEEE legislation (Sinha-Khetriwal et al. 2005 ). They have organized systems for E-waste collection, recycling, disposal and monitoring (Wath et al. 2010; Ongondo et al. 2011 ). The E-waste system of most developing countries including Ghana is dominated by the informal sector who struggle to cope with the negative environmental impacts of informal E-waste recycling (Sinha-Khetriwal et al. 2005 ). Recovering metals from E-waste uses considerably less materials and energy with relatively less environmental damage as compared to mining, manufacturing, transport and energy use (Cui and Forssberg 2003; Bains et al. 2006; Bohr 2007 ). E-waste is one of the most complex waste streams because of the wide variety of components and their compositions, and rapidly changing product designs. For example, electric and electronic components are being increasingly added into other product categories such as tools, toys, kitchen utensils and machinery (Lauridsen and Jørgensen 2010 ). Challenges faced in E-waste management in Ghana is therefore not only because of consequence of the growing quantities of waste, but also of complexity of E-waste. Complexity in the design and composition of electrical and electronic devices renders them technically and economically undesirable for reuse or recycling (Berkhout and Hertin 2004; Realff et al. 2004; Toffel and Horvath 2004 ). Most E-waste ends in emerging economies and developing countries: 70% of all exported E-waste ends in China (Liu et al. 2006 ), with significant quantities ending in India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Nigeria and Ghana (Puckett et al. 2005) and possibly Mexico and Brazil (Robinson 2009 ).\nGhana is a signatory to the 1989 Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movement of hazardous waste and disposal; however, loopholes such as export of E-waste as second-hand goods have ensured large imports of E-waste into Ghana (Orisakwe and Frazzoli 2010 ). Ghana recently approved its own specific legislation to deal with E-waste menace (Daum et al. 2017 ). Ghana’s legislation seeks to domesticate the Basel Convention into its own national laws and establish an electrical and electronic waste management fund to support establishment of treatment facilities, research and public education. The generation of domestic E-waste in Ghana has become significant in recent years with domestic E-waste generation estimated to be about 150,000 tonnes in 2009 while imported electrical and electronic devices reached 215,000 tonnes (Amoyaw-Osei et al. 2011 ). Thirty percent of imports were new and unused items, with the remaining 70% consisting of second-hand goods. These tonnages may likely increase with the current and projected annual population growth rate of 7% (Akormedi 2012 ). The use of information technology such as mobile phones and computers has increased significantly because of increasing affordability. Unlike most developed countries, who have formalized and efficient collection and recycling programs and established policies and legislations governing E-waste, most developing countries are lagging and grappling with serious challenges on E-waste. Our study has the following objectives; we aim to review metal(loids) pollution, pathways and impacts from E-waste recycling operations focusing on the global E-waste problem, E-waste processing and dismantling, possible transport pathways for contaminants at E-waste recycling sites and environmental and biological receptors for contaminants.\nSources of metal(loid)s in E-waste\nElectronic products especially personal computers have grown exponentially in the last decade (Realff et al. 2004 ). This presents disposal challenges at the end-of-life for many of these products. However, 1000 or more substances are embedded in E-waste many of which are toxic such as Cr (VI), As, Se, Cd and Hg (Widmer et al. 2005 ). E-waste also contains several valuable substances including precious metals such as Pd, Pt and Au. The material composition of E-waste, made up of both valuable and toxic substances is the primary factor which drives material recycling of E-waste. For example, first generation computers, which contains 1 g of Au today used to contain about 4 g of Au (Agarwal et al. 2003 ). Over half of the material composition in E-waste is metals (APME 1995; EMPA 2005 ). Precious metals have been used in E-waste as contact materials because of desirable physical and chemical characteristics such as high electrical conductivity and chemical stability (Cui and Zhang 2008 ). Table 1 shows chemical constituents of some electronic components.\nTable 1 Metal(loid)s and other chemical elements in electronic components (adapted Teller 2006)\nFull size table\nInformal E-waste recycling operations\nE-waste recycling in many developing countries is largely operated by the informal sector, who is involved in collection, recycling, refurbishment, reuse and disposal of residuals. The informal sector, mostly large and of low-wage workers possess an impressive ability to repair and refurbish the used electronic equipment for local resale (BAN 2005 ). Scavengers usually move about from households and businesses purchasing old electrical and electronic goods and selling them to recyclers. Components are then processed to directly useable components or secondary raw materials in a variety of refining and conditioning processes (Oteng-Ababio 2012 ). Rudimentary methods such as manual disassembly, open burning and sometimes acid leaching are used to strip the most valuable and easily extractable components in open yards with no emission control. Uncontrolled acid leaching and open burning could induce severe environmental contamination through the release of many toxic substances such as brominated flame retardants (BFRs), a component of many plastic components used in E-waste, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins and furans and other volatile and toxic metals and metalloids (EMPA 2009 ). E-waste dumping in surface waters or on land adjacent to waterbodies could result in run-off and dispersion of various toxic contaminants to estuaries and agricultural fields. In Ghana, the Korle Lagoon, which used to support a thriving fishery industry (Biney 1998) has been polluted by organic and inorganic contaminants (Huang et al. 2014; Hosoda et al. 2014 ). Furthermore, hazardous metal(loids) may leach through the soil and contaminate drinking water sources including groundwater. Metal(loid)s and organic contamination present a health hazard particularly when recyclers use bare hands to strip components of E-waste and do not wear protective clothing. Humans living in vicinal suburbs risk contamination from pollutants dispersed via particulate matter through environmental pathways such as air, food, water, dust, smoke and or fumes. Metals, unlike organic contaminants, do not undergo microbial or chemical degradation, are persistent, and may be bioaccumulative and toxic (Adriano et al. 2004 ). There is limited information on the impacts of E-waste on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Kiddee et al. 2013 ).\nHealth and environmental impacts\nE-waste impacts on the health outcomes of human populations in developing countries have been reviewed by several workers (Frazzoli et al. 2010; Grant et al. 2013 ). However, less evidence has been collected to evaluate direct harm to individuals exposed to E-waste, with many reasons such as long-term exposure to E-waste, unstable condition of the subject population and other underlying unhealthy conditions (Sthiannopkao and Wong 2013 ). The main environmental impacts from E-waste recycling sites depend on the type of processing activity. For example, non-thermal processes (hydrometallurgy) generate wastewater in large quantities because of greater volumes of water used. In contrast, thermal processes (pyrometallurgy) generate abundant gaseous pollutants including lead fumes and dioxins (Bizzo et al. 2014 ). Some of the media through which toxicants are released from E-waste recycling sites is discussed in Section 4.1.\nMetal(loid)s in airborne particulates\nMany pretreatment processes used in informal E-waste recycling including grinding, melting, roasting and open burning releases large amounts of fumes, dust and smoke into the atmosphere, with potential carcinogens including chromium and manganese (Zheng et al. 2013, 2016 ). Total concentrations of PM 2.5 in an E-waste recycling area showed higher concentrations in a reference area and exceeded WHO 24-h PM 2.5 ambient air quality guidelines set at 25 μg m −3 (Zheng et al. 2016 ). The total suspended samples form a printed circuit boards recycling area contained water-soluble inorganic ions in a decreasing order (SO 4 2−, NH 4+, K+, Na+, Cl − and NO 3 −) (Bi et al. 2010 ). Significant concentrations of Pb (6.1%), Zn (4.6%), Sn (2.9%) and lesser concentrations (< 1%) of Cu, Sb, Mn, Ni, Ba and Cd were observed in the workshop of the recycling area. Analysis of printed circuit board fly ash in a simulated open burn facility indicated high concentrations of bromine (21%), lead (8%), copper (5%), tin (1%) and lesser concentrations (< 1%) of zinc and antimony (Gullet et al. 2007 ). Flue gas from incineration of personal computer motherboards and keyboards contained significant quantities of Cu, Sb and Pb and trace metal(loid)s including Be, Cr, Mn, Co, As, Ag, Cd and Ba. Mercury, selenium and thallium were not detected in the flue gas (Stewart and Lemieux 2003 ). Suspended air particulates in a dismantling area of an E-waste recycling workshop in Hong Kong contained highest concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb with high metal concentrations attributable to dust generated from manual dismantling of electrical and electronic equipment using hand-held tools (Lau et al. 2014 ). Copper and zinc concentrations were however highest in the cable shredding areas, due to their abundance in cables (Lau et al. 2014 ).\nWastewater from dismantling and shredding activities\nE-waste is a concentrated source of rare earth metals and plastics. Recycling metals from E-waste can generate less wastewater as compared to mining metals from mineral ores. Large amounts of land and energy are used mining, releasing large amounts of wastewater, sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide (Zhang et al. 2012 ). Water resources can be severely polluted by the improper disposal of wastewater (Shinkuma and Huong 2009 ). E-waste processing employing hydrometallurgy using toxic acids (nitric acid) and cyanide produces large amounts of wastewater containing acids and various metallic ions such as cyanide, which can damage people and the environment if not treated efficiently. Wastewater from hydrometallurgical processes are usually not treated and disposed efficiently because of lack of wastewater treatment facilities (Xiang et al. 2007 ).\nFly and bottom ash from E-waste burning\nFly ash refers to airborne fine grained material with high specific surface area (Ferreira et al. 2003 ). Fly ash particulates laden with metal(loid)s and other toxic materials are usually emitted in the open burning of materials resulting in increased exposure through contamination of food, soil and surface water (Zheng et al. 2008 ). During E-waste incineration, volatile metals are enriched into fly ash while lithophilic metals are deposited into bottom ash (Jung et al. 2004 ).\nLeachates from dumping of E-waste\nE-waste contributes approximately 70% by mass of metals (Grossman 2006 ). Leachates extracted from river sediments and paddy soils for toxicity testing by undergoing a 6-h extraction on a horizontal oscillator with bubbling nitrogen and subsequent filtration with 0.45-μm pore filter and 0.22-μm membrane filter showed higher concentrations in river sediments than in paddy soils (Nie et al. 2015 ). The concentrations of Pb in leached extracts of 36 cathode ray tubes (CRTs) had been assessed using Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), and 21 of colour CRTs exceeded 5 mg/L, the regulatory limit for characterization as hazardous waste (Townsend et al. 1999 ). Metals were concentrated in the funnel component which recorded average lead concentration of 75.3 mg/L (Townsend et al. 1999 ).\nE-waste solid materials\nStudies on assessment of E-waste impacts have focused on solid materials components of E-waste such as printed wiring boards of personal computers (Li et al. 2006; Bizzo et al. 2014) that of mobile phones (Nnorom and Osibanjo 2011 ), combination of mobile phones’ and personal computers’ printed wiring boards (Yamane et al. 2011 ), simulated landfill columns (Li et al. 2009 ), CRT monitors (Musson et al. 2000; Nnorom et al. 2010) and mobile phone plastic housing units (Nnorom and Osibanjo 2009 ). Leachate analysis showed non-detectable concentrations of Pb and other toxic metals, significant concentrations of Pb ranging from 1590 to 2930 mg/kg in solid samples (Li et al. 2009 ). Material recovery benefits of E-waste recycling and concentrations of metals after undergoing mechanical separation have been evaluated and the data compared with 13 similar studies (Bizzo et al. 2014 ). Smaller particle sized printed wiring board (particle size of < 1.18 mm) contained higher inorganic material than larger particle sizes (> 1.18 mm). Lighter printed wiring boards (density of < 2.89 g cm −3) had higher average volatile content and gross calorific value (GCV), despite having a higher ash content (Bizzo et al. 2014 ).\nMajor transport pathways in E-waste recycling environment\nContaminants released from E-waste recycling environments are dispersed among and/or can accumulate in various environmental compartments (e.g. soil, vegetation, indoor dust, animals and humans). While some contaminants contribute to local pollution (i.e. within 10 km), other substances remain persistent for a long time and can be distributed over much greater distances, contributing to regional pollution (i.e. over hundreds of kilometres) (NAP 2000 ).\nDust\nDust as environmental media could provide useful information on concentrations, distributions and fate of contaminants present in the surface environment (Leung et al. 2008 ). Dust dispersion is dependent on physical and micro-environmental factors, including topography, wind direction and urban run-off (Wong et al. 2006 ). Air currents may influence wind speed and direction, and this in addition to the topography and positioning of buildings control deposition and dispersion of metal-laden dusts and particulates (Wong et al. 2006 ). The metals in settled dust from various receiving surfaces such as roads, top soils, buildings and plants can be easily re-suspended and dispersed among different environmental media including air and water (Kong et al. 2011 ). Metals in dust have a direct influence on public safety since they can easily enter human bodies by dust ingestion, dermal contact and inhalation (Abrahams 2002 ). Settled dust is similar in composition to atmospheric metal particulates and can be used as an indicator of atmospheric pollution (Akhter and Madany 1993 ). House dust is an important exposure medium for many environmental contaminants deposited on indoor surfaces from outdoor and internal sources (Adgate et al. 1995 ). In countries with moderate climate, the time spent indoors could vary between 70 and 90% depending on age, occupation and season. Children inadvertently has higher health risks than adults because of low tolerance to metal toxicity and ingestion of dusts (soils) through hand-to-mouth (Ljung et al. 2005; Acosta et al. 2009 ). Metal concentrations may be evaluated in dust deposited on unit area (Krolak 2000 ). Dust in E-waste recycling sites in developing countries have recorded elevated concentrations of some toxic metal(loid)s. For example, As and Sb concentrations in surface dusts from 13 E-waste recycling villages in Guiyu, southeastern China showed higher concentrations (about 13–147 times) of Sb (Bi et al. 2011 ). However, in Bi et al. 2011 study, arsenic concentrations in dust samples reflected mainly background concentrations. In a study to assess diffusion of metal(loid)s from E-waste recycling area, soils and road dust samples were collected from 11 sampling points in residential areas, garden/park, and school/kindergarten in Guiyu and a reference area, about 31.6 km east of Guiyu, during four seasons (Yekeen et al. 2016 ). Results from the study showed significantly higher concentrations for soil Pb than road dust Pb (Yekeen et al. 2016 ). On the other hand, average concentrations for Pb in road dust for all seasons were significantly higher compared to Pb concentrations in the reference area (Yekeen et al. 2016 ). Metal(loid)s dispersion in agricultural surface soils and soils (dusts) from an E-waste recycling workshop in Longtang, northern Guangzhou was studied (Liu et al. 2013 ). Dust sampled from one workshop yard where E-waste recycling activities such as dismantling of electric motors, air conditioner compressors and water metres, contained the highest concentrations of all eight metals measured. Copper, cadmium, mercury, zinc, lead and Ni exceeded the maximum level of metal allowances per the Chinese Soil Standard Grade II by 326, 203, 192, 27.7, 19.2 and 14-fold, respectively (Liu et al. 2013 ). Fujimori et al. (2012) study on surface matrices (soil and dust) from formal E-waste recycling sites in northern and southern Metro Manila, Philippines indicated that dust from formal recycling sites contained the highest concentration of metal(loid)s including Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Ag, In and Pb. Ofudje et al. (2014) investigated metals (Pb, Cr, Ni, Cd and Zn) content in dusts in four E-waste dismantling sites in Lagos, Nigeria during the dry season and recorded significant higher lead concentrations than were recorded by Adaramodu et al. (2012) who investigated metals in dust from surfaces of E-waste components as well as floor of a E-waste recycling yard in Lagos, Nigeria. In Ghana, most of the literature on metal(loid)s in dust are focussed on road dust (Atiemo et al. 2011; Atiemo et al. 2012; Addo et al. 2012 ), surface dust at E-waste recycling site (Atiemo et al. 2012 ), rain water contaminated by suspended dust during road construction (Pelig-Ba et al. 2001 ), dust deposited by traffic (Essumang et al. 2006) and surface soil in gold mining areas (Golow et al. 1996 ). Kyere et al. (2016) work revealed that metal(loid) contaminants had dispersed beyond Agbogbloshie E-waste processing areas onto residential, recreational, commercial and farms circumjacent to the main E-waste processing area.\nAir\nMetal concentrations in ambient air and exposure biomarkers had been assessed in both formal and informal E-waste recycling environments in several countries including Ghana (Asante et al. 2012; Caravanos et al. 2011 ), Sweden (Julander et al. 2014 ), China (Deng et al. 2006) and in India (Ha et al. 2009 ). Cr, Zn, As and Pb concentrations were enhanced in the fine particulate fraction (78–108%) of total suspended particles in air at Guiyu, a popular E-waste recycling centre in China (Wong et al. 2007 ).\nSurface water\nE-waste recycling sites, especially where E-waste are combusted are usually located near sources of water including streams and ponds to conveniently take advantage of potential water sources for metal extraction processes (Luo et al. 2011 ). E-waste contaminants can enter aquatic systems via leaching from dumped processed or unprocessed E-wastes (Robinson 2009 ). Acid disposal following hydrometallurgical recycling of E-waste and dissolution of airborne particulates from E-waste can result in the contamination of aquatic systems (Robinson 2009 ). Guo et al. (2009) determined the effects of E-waste recycling activities on the surrounding waterway system in Guiyu and found that concentrations of metal(loid)s including Ni, Cu, As, Cd, Hg and Pb decreased downstream from Guiyu E-waste processing village through Lanjiang River to Haimen Bay estuary. Wang and Guo (2006) earlier on investigated the effects of E-waste recycling on surface water, groundwater and sediments from three locations to establish whether E-waste recycling activities were impacting on the surrounding environment or not. It was established that Ni, Cu, Zn, As and Hg concentrations were generally below the Chinese environmental guidelines for surface water quality. In Ghana, threats to waterbodies by metal(loid)s in E-waste has been emphasized strongly (Brigden et al. 2008; Chama et al. 2014; Huang et al. 2014 ). Chama et al. (2014) work showed that sediments of Odaw River were more contaminated with Ni, Cu, Cd and Pb near E-waste burning site than other sites further away such as vegetable cultivation area and an area where there wasn’t any E-waste recycling activity. Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Hg and Pb concentrations in surface sediments in an E-waste disassembly area and an industrial park in Nanguan River, Taizhou in East China were studied (Chen et al. 2010 ). Although, metal(loid)s concentrations were much higher than control sediments samples taken from an upstream area and the Netherlands Quality Criteria for dredged material, the concentrations were generally lower than a Basel Action Network (BAN) study conducted in Guiyu (BAN 2002 ). Metals generally tend to bind to sediment particles when entering a river system, with a greater probability of being re-suspended into the river during acidic conditions (Wong et al. 2007 ).\nSoil\nSoils are prone to contamination from hydrological and atmospheric sources (Candeias et al. 2014 ). Soils are sinks for various gaseous and particulate atmospheric pollutants emitted from E-waste recycling (Liu et al. 2013 ). Metals could be released into the soil environment through natural processes, such as volcanic activity, erosion and bioaccumulation; intentional anthropogenic processes, such as mining, smelting, industrial uses and unintentional anthropogenic processes such as incineration and burning of fossil fuels (Caussy et al. 2003 ). Elements could be introduced into distance environments through immobilization by sorption, complexation with iron and manganese oxides and organic or humic substances (Arhin and Boansi 2016 ). Many metals, persistent and non-degradable can enter human bodies through dust inhalation, direct soil ingestion and the consumption of food crops (Li et al. 2012 ). Several plants absorb metals from soils and accumulate them in their tissues depending on varying accumulating potential (Liu et al. 2006; Herat and Agamuthu 2012; Yao et al. 2013 ). Bioavailability of metals varies with the soil types and soil pH. Sandy soils allow for the greater bioavailability than clay-rich soils and low soil pH generally increases plant bioavailability (Chaney and Hornick 1978 ). Studies conducted on soils of E-waste recycling sites in both India and China over the years has showed high concentrations of metals and metalloids. For example, in Bangalore and Chennai, India, ten surface soils samples from a licensed E-waste recycling facility, backyard recycling sites and reference sites showed high concentrations of V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Mo, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Pb, TI and Bi (Ha et al. 2009 ). Crude methods of recycling had probably added higher concentrations of metal contaminants into soils sampled in backyard recycling workshops in slum areas. A similar trend was also reported in Guiyu, where concentrations of 11 metal(loid)s including Be, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sb, Cd, Hg and Pb in an E-waste dismantling area, showed high correlations between metal concentrations in surface soils and E-waste dismantling activities (Li et al. 2011 ). Metal concentrations generally decreased with depths along a depth gradient with elevated pH and reduced total organic matter (TOM) in both burning site and paddy field (Wu et al. 2015 ). The concentration and source apportionment of metals in urban soils, apart from spatial variation also vary with depth because of temporal inputs characteristics and leaching transport of pollutants (Zhang et al. 2007 ). Fujimori and Takigami (2014) measured the concentrations of Zn, Cu and Pb in small spot areas using a field-portable X-ray spectrometer within a small informal E-waste recycling area in Metro Manila. The distance from the entrance of the study site influenced the surficial metal concentration gradient at distances away from the entrance on the y -axis (perpendicular) direction, rather than on the x -axis (horizontal) direction, and that metal concentrations were discretely distributed in surface soils, showing heterogenous distribution of soil metal(loid)s.\nBiota\nVarious plant species including trees, vegetable crops, grasses and weeds are known to accumulate a wide range of metals (Kabata-Pendias and Pendias 1992 ). There are public health implications if plant foods accumulate high concentrations of metals; furthermore, leaf fall and dispersal may pose a hazard. The metal species is an important factor in various transfer routes of metals into various food chain compartments (Notten et al. 2005 ). Metal speciation is also dependent on variable soil properties including pH, organic matter, clay content (Salomons and Förstner 1984 ). Metal distribution across soil profile and rooting depth are other contributing factors (Martin and Coughtrey 1982 ). Total metal concentrations were twice higher in plants (S. viridis and peanut) in E-waste recycling areas than in similar plants from farmland areas (Wang et al. 2015 ). Sun et al. (2014) sampled 18 plant species from 16 families near an industrial area in Chenzhou city, Hunan Province, China and found that order of metal concentration in plant samples followed a similar pattern to soils from which the plants were taken. Metal uptake via roots from contaminated soils and surface water, and direct deposition of contaminants from the atmosphere onto plant surfaces can lead to plant contamination by metals (Zhuang et al. 2009 ). Continuous E-waste exposure through contaminated water and soil elevate chemical loadings of pastures (Frazzoli et al. 2010 ); long-term intake by diary ruminants may occur which could result in bioaccumulation in tissues and excretion in edible products such as eggs and milk (Kierkegaard et al. 2007 ). In Ghana, concentrations of Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Hg and Pb in two common plants (Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn. and Sida acuta Burm. f. ), growing around four refuse dumps had higher concentrations than in a reference site, 1 km apart (Agyarko et al. 2010 ).\nConclusion\nFrom this review work, literature on E-waste pollution has been synthesized to emphasize E-waste recycling impacts on major environmental media. Sound management of metal(loid)s emitted from E-waste recycling operations is a priority. In already contaminated environments, there is the need for management of these sites since they present major risks to human health and the environment. Remediation of already contaminated E-waste recycling environments in developing countries and emerging economies is also a greatest need.\nReferences\nAbrahams PW (2002) Soils: their implications to human health.
