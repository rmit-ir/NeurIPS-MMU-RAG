Pull tight to form a central knot.  \n2. **Make bunny ear loops**: Create small loops on each lace, holding them between your thumb and fingers.  \n3. **Tie the loops**: Place one loop over the other, tuck it behind the other, and thread it through the hole created.  \n4. **Pull tight**: Hold both loops and pull them snugly to secure the laces.  \n\nFor an alternative, the **standard method** [5] involves creating a loop on one lace, wrapping the other lace around it, and pulling through to form a second loop. Both methods are beginner-friendly and widely taught. If you prefer a more secure knot, try the **surgeon's knot** [3], which is strong and easy to undo.  \n\nFor visual guidance, you can watch the step-by-step tutorial on Howcast [7], which breaks the process into 11 clear steps.", "citations": [], "contexts": []}
{"query_id": "V_0405", "generated_response": "\n\nDropping a raw egg on a needle would likely cause it to crack or break. The needle's sharp, hard surface concentrates the force of the impact on a small area of the eggshell, which is more likely to exceed the shell's structural integrity compared to a softer surface. This is similar to dropping the egg on concrete [3], but the needle's point further increases the risk of localized stress leading to cracking. The egg would not survive the impact.", "citations": [], "contexts": []}
