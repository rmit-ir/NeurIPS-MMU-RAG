{"query_id": "V_0991", "generated_response": "\n\nHelicopters fly by using rotating blades (main rotor) to generate lift and thrust. The main rotor blades, shaped like airfoils, create lift by deflecting air downward, which generates an upward force (Bernoulli’s principle [4]). This lift counteracts gravity, allowing the helicopter to hover or move. The blades’ pitch angle (angle of attack) is adjusted to control lift magnitude and direction [3]. \n\nA tail rotor is essential to counteract the torque from the main rotor’s rotation, preventing the helicopter’s fuselage from spinning [1]. The tail rotor produces thrust in a sideways direction, enabling yaw control (direction changes) [5]. \n\nHelicopter pilots use collective and cyclic pitch controls to adjust blade angles. The collective control changes pitch uniformly for vertical movement, while the cyclic control tilts the blades asymmetrically for lateral movement [6]. \n\nAdditionally, helicopters can autorotate if the engine fails, allowing descent using remaining rotor momentum [5]. These mechanisms enable precise maneuverability, including hovering, forward motion, and 360-degree rotations [2].", "citations": [], "contexts": []}

{"query_id": "T_0770", "generated_response": "\n\nA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is a financial tool used to estimate the value of an investment by calculating the present value of its future cash flows. Here's a simplified breakdown for beginners:\n\n1. **Time Value of Money**:  \n   Money today is worth more than the same amount in the future because it can be invested to earn returns. For example, $100 today might grow to more than $100 in a year if invested [4]. This principle underlies DCF, where future cash flows are \"discounted\" to reflect their lower present value.\n\n2. **Forecasting Cash Flows**:  \n   You project a company’s future cash flows over a specific period (e.g., 5–10 years). This involves estimating revenues, expenses, and capital expenditures. For instance, a business might forecast $100,000 in annual cash flow for the next 5 years [1].\n\n3. **Discount Rate**:  \n   A discount rate is applied to account for the risk of the investment and the opportunity cost of capital. This rate is often the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which reflects the return investors expect for bearing risk [2]. A higher risk leads to a higher discount rate.\n\n4. **Terminal Value**:  \n   After the forecast period, the model estimates the value of cash flows beyond that point (e.g., \"terminal year\"). Two common methods are:  \n   - **Multiples Method**: Multiply the terminal year’s earnings by a market multiple (e.g., EV/EBITDA) [2].  \n   - **Perpetuity Method**: Assume a constant growth rate (e.g., 2–4%) and calculate the terminal value as:  \n     $$\n     \\text{Terminal Value} = \\frac{\\text{Last Year’s Cash Flow}}{\\text{WACC} - \\text{Growth Rate}}.\n     $$\n\n5. **Discounting Cash Flows**:  \n   Each projected cash flow is discounted back to its present value using the discount rate. For example, a $100,000 cash flow in Year 1 would be worth less than $100,000 today [4]. These discounted values are summed to get the total present value of the investment.\n\n6. **Example**:  \n   A university considering building student residences might forecast annual rental income and subtract costs (repairs, energy, etc.). Each year’s net cash flow is discounted, and the terminal value (after the building’s useful life) is added to determine the total value [5].\n\n**Key Takeaway**: DCF is a foundational tool in finance, but its accuracy depends on the quality of cash flow forecasts and the appropriate discount rate. It’s widely used for valuing companies, projects, or investments [1][2].", "citations": [], "contexts": []}

For example:\n\n```elixir\nEnum.reverse([1, 2, 3])  # Output: [3, 2, 1]\n```\n\nThis is directly mentioned in search result [1], where the answer suggests using `Enum.reverse/1` for reversing a list. Additionally, search result [4] provides an example of reversing a list with `x = Enum.reverse(x)`. \n\nOther methods in the search results either involve more complex operations (e.g., transposing lists or splitting by keywords) or are specific to binaries, not standard list reversal. Thus, `Enum.reverse/1` is the standard and recommended approach for reversing lists in Elixir.", "citations": [], "contexts": []}

Dispensing includes writing and filling prescriptions and selling medication to patients. Giving samples is not considered dispensing [8].  \n\n2. **Online Registration**:  \n   - Log in to your Florida Board of Nursing \"Online Services\" portal.  \n   - Under the \"Manage My License\" section, select \"Controlled Substance Prescribing\" to designate yourself as a controlled substance prescribing practitioner. This is required for certain roles, including advanced registered nurse practitioners (APRNs) [2].  \n\n3. **Form Submission**: If you need to add dispensing to your license explicitly, submit the **Dispensing Practitioner Application** [1]. This form can be printed online from the Board of Medicine’s Resources page [1].  \n\n4. **Fees**:  \n   - Registration fee: $100.  \n   - Renewal fee: $100.  \n   - Payment must be made via cashier’s check or money order payable to the \"Department of Health\" [1].  \n\n5. **Renewal**: Ensure your dispensing license is renewed when renewing your APRN license. The Board of Nursing does not maintain a list of approved APRN programs, so applicants must meet state requirements [3].  \n\nFor physicians, registration with the Florida Department of Health as a \"dispensing practitioner\" is required, with a $100 fee and delegation to PAs or NPs [6]. Always verify the most current guidelines on the Florida Board of Nursing or Board of Medicine websites.", "citations": [], "contexts": []}
{"query_id": "T_0147", "generated_response": "\n\nThe Black Death had profound effects on people's lives, including massive mortality, economic shifts, and social changes. It killed an estimated 30–60% of Europe's population, with 25 million people dying globally between 1348 and 1351 [1]. This led to labor shortages, which increased wages for peasants and weakened feudal systems, giving commoners more economic power [1]. Socially, it disrupted communities, with villages often wiped out, leading to food shortages and forced migration [1]. Many believed the plague was divine punishment, causing chaos, fear, and blame of minorities like Jews [1]. Religiously, the church's authority was challenged as people lost faith in divine explanations [4]. Overall, the plague reshaped Europe's social, economic, and religious structures [1].", "citations": [], "contexts": []}
{"query_id": "T_0857", "generated_response": "\n\nIbuprofen can be synthesized through several methods, with two prominent approaches being the **Boot process** and the **Hoechst process**, both involving Friedel-Crafts acylation of isobutylbenzene [1]. These traditional methods require multiple steps (6 for Boot, 3 for Hoechst) and rely on catalysts like AlCl₃ [1]. \n\nA more modern method involves a **continuous-flow synthesis** developed by MIT researchers, which completes the synthesis in **three minutes** using a microreactor. This process avoids toxic reagents like triflic acid and uses common reagents, with steps including:  \n1. Solvent-free Friedel-Crafts acylation of isobutylbenzene and propionyl chloride.  \n2. 1,2-aryl migration with iodine monochloride (ICl) and trimethyl orthoformate.  \n3. Hydrolysis to form ibuprofen sodium carboxylate [3].  \n\nThis method achieves an **83% yield** and scales to produce 8.09 g/h, using a reactor half the size of a standard fume hood [3]. A chiral synthesis by Cheminor aims for pure S-ibuprofen but is unlikely to have commercial significance due to the body’s ability to convert inactive R-form to active S-form [1].  \n\nFor industrial production, the continuous-flow method is highlighted for its efficiency and scalability [3].", "citations": [], "contexts": []}
{"query_id": "T_0493", "generated_response": "\n\nEpistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature, origin, scope, and justification of knowledge. It explores questions such as \"What do we know?\" \"What distinguishes knowledge from belief or true opinion?\" and \"What makes a belief justified?\" [1]. Key areas of focus include the conditions required for a belief to count as knowledge (e.g., truth and justification), the sources of knowledge (e.g., perception, reason, testimony), and debates about the structure of knowledge systems. It also addresses philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility of certain knowledge, and examines issues like the Gettier problem, which challenges the idea that knowledge is simply \"justified true belief.\" [1].", "citations": [], "contexts": []}
{"query_id": "T_0957", "generated_response": "\n\nSynthetic data can address data scarcity in public health by generating statistically valid datasets that mimic real-world data while preserving privacy. This is particularly useful when real data is limited, sensitive, or restricted due to confidentiality concerns [1]. For example, synthetic data can emulate key features of actual health datasets, enabling statistical analysis and machine learning model training without exposing individual-level information [2]. \n\nIn public health, synthetic data can also help overcome data scarcity in areas like rare diseases or underrepresented populations, where real data is limited. Techniques like iterative regression analysis can generate synthetic data with statistical properties similar to real datasets, as demonstrated in the FIFA players dataset example [2]. This approach allows researchers to create larger, more diverse datasets for modeling and prediction, improving the accuracy and efficiency of public health analyses. \n\nAdditionally, synthetic data can facilitate scenario testing for public health interventions by simulating potential future events, helping policymakers prepare for risks while adhering to privacy regulations [2].", "citations": [], "contexts": []}
