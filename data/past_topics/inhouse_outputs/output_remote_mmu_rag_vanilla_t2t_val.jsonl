Are you tired of tying your shoes the same old boring way, day after day? With just a few easy steps, you can ditch the monotony of your everyday \"granny\"-style shoelace knot and have the coolest kicks in town.\nMethod 1\nMaking an Extra-Secure Surgeon's Knot Download Article\n1\nMake a standard \"right over left\" starting knot and loop. If you've noticed that your shoelaces seem to come untied frequently, try this knot, which is based off of the super-secure knot that doctors use to tie sutures after surgery (the knot is also popular with fishermen.) [1] To start, make the same sort of basic \"right over left\" knot that you'd begin with when tying your shoes normally. [2]\nTo do this, simply take your right lace and cross it over the left lace. Wrap it around the left lace once and pull tight. You're done!\n2\nMake a loop with one lace. After this, make a small \"looped\" section by doubling one of the laces back on itself. You're not doing any tying or wrapping here — just re-positioning one string so that it makes a U shape.\n3\nBring the free lace behind the loop and around the front. Next, take the lace that you didn't make a loop with and pull it so it crosses behind the loop. Then, pull it back around in front of the loop. This should make a small \"hole\" between the two laces and the initial \"right over left\" knot at the bottom.\n4\nMake a second loop with the free lace and feed it through the \"hole.\" Take the slack end of the free lace in your hand and make a second loop by doubling it up on itself in a U shape (just like you did with the other lace.) Push this second loop through the \"hole\" that was formed in the previous step.\nResist the urge to pull the knot tight at this point — if you do, you'll just be left with an ordinary shoelace knot.\n5\nWrap the new loop around the lace and back through the hole. Now, take the second loop that you just pushed through the hole and wrap it all the way around the first loop. Push it back through the hole one again. \"Double-wrapping\" the loop this way is what makes the surgeon's knot so secure — the friction that's generated when the tightly-wrapped laces rub against each makes it very hard for this knot to come undone.\n6\nPull the loops to tighten. Now, you can simply pull the loops in opposite directions to tighten the knot. The results will look a little like a standard shoelace knot, but should be much more secure.\nIf you really don't want your laces to come undone, try soaking the knot in water before pulling it tight. As the water evaporates, the fabric of the laces will constrict, making the knot even tighter. [3]\nXResearch source\n7\nUndo the knot by pulling on the lace ends. Though this knot shouldn't come undone accidentally, it's not hard to undo when you want to take off your shoes. Simply pull on the loose ends of the laces like you would with an ordinary shoe knot and the surgeon's knot should come apart easily.\nMethod 2\nTying a \"Mini Noose\" Knot Download Article\n1\nMake a basic \"right over left\" starting knot. This odd shoelace knot looks a little like a tiny noose, making it great for adding some creepy flavor to your outfit for Halloween and other spooky occasions. To start, all you need to do is make a very basic starting knot (the same kind you'd start with when tying your shoes normally.) [4]\nAs a reminder, to make this basic knot, take your right lace and cross it over the left lace. Wrap it under the left lace once and pull tight. Note that this part is exactly the same step as in the section above.\n2\nMake a loop with one lace. Next, take the right lace and double about an inch or two of the lace back on itself to make a \"loop\" or U-shaped section. Just like in a real noose, this loop will eventually become the \"neck hole.\"\nOnce you make the loop, take the loop and the other lace in your hand, and hold both so that they are pointing upward. This isn't essential, but it ensures that all of your laces are positioned correctly for the next step and keeps things a little tidier as you start to make the noose.\n3\nCoil the free lace around the loop. Starting at about the middle point of the loop, start wrapping the free section of lace around both parts of the loop and the other lace. In other words, you should be wrapping the lace around a \"bundle\" of three laces: both sides of the loop and the free lace. Work your way down towards the bottom of the loop, coiling tightly as you go.\nThere's no exact number of coils you need to make this way — longer laces will be able to make more coils than shorter ones, but as long as you are able to make about four or five, your knot should hold.\n4\nFeed the lace through the gap at the bottom. When you've coiled the free lace all the way to the bottom of the loop, take whatever slack is left and pass it through the small hole between the initial \"right over left\" knot and the lace that you've been using to coil. This hole should be near the bottom of the coil you just made, but slightly off to the side. When you've done this, pull the lace gently to tighten.\nIf your lace isn't long enough to reach the bottom of the loop, try starting over and making the initial loop smaller.\n5\nUndo the knot by pulling on the loop. When you're ready to untie this mini noose knot, slip your finger into the loop and pull up. The \"loose\" side of the noose should pull through the coil easily and the entire knot should fall apart.\nOn the other hand, pulling the \"tight\" side of the noose should cause the coil to tighten. You may want to give this side a tug after you put on your shoes to keep your knot tight during your daily activity.\nMethod 3\nTying a One-Handed Knot Download Article\n1\nTie the lace to one of the top eyelets. This unconventional knot can be done entirely with one hand, making it a great choice for when you need to tie your shoes while doing something else. [5] However, this knot requires you to lace your shoes in a special way. This initial lacing is tricky, but not impossible with one hand. Start by tying the lace to one of the top eyelets — the little holes on either side of the tongue that the laces go through.\n2\nUse a zig-zagging lace arrangement. If your shoe isn't already unlaced, pull the lace out until it's completely free (except for the eyelet it's tied to.) Next, re-lace the shoe in a zig-zagging pattern as follows:\nThread the lace through the eyelet at the top that's directly across from it. in other words, if you started at the top left eyelet, thread the lace into the top right one.\nPull the lace under and through the eyelet directly beneath the previous one. It should go under the material between the two eyelets, not over it.\nThread the lace through the eyelet directly across from it again.\nContinue this \"down, across, down, across\" pattern until you reach the last eyelet at the bottom. If there are an even number of eyelets (which there usually are), the lace should end at the side opposite the starting point. If there are an odd number, it will end at the same side.\n3\nThread the lace back through the second-last eyelet. Take the loose end of the lace and bring it back across the tongue of the shoe. Thread it through this eyelet — this may be tricky if you have thick laces, but it should be possible.\n4\nMake a loop with the slack. Use the thumb and index finger of your shoe-tying hand to make a loop that's an inch or so long with the loose end of the lace. If you're using one hand, you can do this by holding the loose part in your palm, then slipping your thumb under it and pushing out.\nWhen you have a loop, hold it so that it lays across the lowest straight section of lace at its middle point. The loop should be pointing across the tongue of the shoe.\n5\nMake a second loop and pull it between the two adjacent laces. This is the only tricky part of the whole knot. Take one side of the loop that's laying across the lowest straight lace section and pull it under the straight lace and over the other side of the loop. This essentially creates a second loop that should be pointing up or down the tongue of the shoe.\nIf you're working with one hand, the easiest way to do this is to grab the initial loop between your thumb and index finger, then use your index finger to push one side of the loop as you guide it under the straight lace and over the other side of the loop.\n6\nTighten the knot and slide it to the eyelet. At this point, you can tighten the knot by pulling on the second loop that you've just created. As you do so, be careful not to pull the loose end of the lace all the way through the knot you've just created or it will come apart.\nContinue pulling the loop down and across to slide it back towards the eyelet — when the knot is tight, it should be touching (or else lie very close to) the eyelet.\n7\nUndo the knot by pulling the loose end of the lace. This one-handed knot is surprisingly tight and should stay fastened through daily activity. When you're ready to take your shoe off, simply pull the free end of the lace and the knot should come apart with ease.\nA word of warning: as you loosen the laces before you take your shoe off, try not to let the loose end of the lace get pulled back through the eyelet. It can be tricky and time-consuming to work the lace back through the eyelet when you re-tie your shoes, especially if you're using one hand.\n8\nFinished.\nCommunity Q&A\nSearch\nSubmit\nTips\nUse long laces — you can always tuck extra slack into your shoe, but there's not much you can do if you don't have enough length to work with.\nIf you have a hard time keeping track of your laces when tying complex knots, try dying one half of each lace a different color (or buying specially made shoelaces that are dyed this way.) This makes it a little easier — since your \"right\" and \"left\" laces look different, they're harder to mix up.\nSubmit a Tip\nAll tip submissions are carefully reviewed before being published\nSubmit\nReferences\n↑ http://www.netknots.com/fishing_knots/surgeons-knot/\n↑ http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/surgeonknot.htm\n↑ http://www.climbing.com/climber/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-knots/\n↑ http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/halloweenknot.htm\n↑ http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/onehandedknot.htm\nAbout This Article\nwikiHow is a “wiki,” similar to Wikipedia, which means that many of our articles are co-written by multiple authors.

Just measure the old ones you would like to replace. Then cut two strips of this length about 1.5 inches wide. Lay the strip onto the ironing board and pin a needle across (see photo). Fold the strip from both sides to the middle and pin a second needle across. Now when you pull the strip will fold automatically, all you need to do is iron it flat. Once this is completed fold the strip over again and iron it flat. You now have a double folded strip 1/4 the width of your original strip.\nYou could also use a bias binding maker tool (see photo).\nAdd Tip\nAsk Question\nComment\nDownload\nStep 3: Sew the Lace\nThe sewing itself is really simple.

Learn to tie your own shoes, and nothing can slow you down.\nInstructions\nStep 1: Put on shoes Put on your untied shoes.\nStep 2: Sit or kneel Sit or kneel on the floor and bend your knee so that you can easily reach one of your feet with both hands. You can also sit on a chair and bring one foot up so that it’s resting on the seat of the chair.\nStep 3: Get foot comfortable Make sure your foot is comfortable in the shoe. If the tongue is scrunched up, tug on it to smooth it out.\nStep 4: Hold shoelaces & tighten Now hold the right-hand shoelace in your right hand, and the left one in your left hand. Pull gently but firmly on each to tighten the shoe comfortably around your foot.\nTIP: Hold the laces near the holes rather than at their ends for the snuggest fit.\nStep 5: Cross laces Cross the lace in your right hand over and then under the one in your left hand. Grab it with your left hand to pull it all the way through. Grab the other lace with your right hand.\nStep 6: Pull to tighten Pull both laces to tighten them.\nTIP: It’s fine to cross the left lace over the right one to start. You might find this feels more natural if you’re left-handed.\nStep 7: Make a loop w/ right lace Make a loop out of the right lace and hold the bottom of it close to the shoe with your right hand. This part can be a little tricky. Everyone does it differently, so experiment until you figure out how it works best for you.\nStep 8: Make loop w/ left lace Make a same-size loop with the left lace, and hold it near the shoe with your left hand.\nStep 9: Cross loops Now do exactly what you did in the beginning with the laces: cross the right-hand loop over the left-hand loop, and then under it.\nStep 10: Grab loops & tighten Grab the loop that’s now on the left with your left hand, and grab the other loop with your right hand. Pull tight, and your shoe is tied!\nTIP: Tie the loops one more time to create a double knot that won’t come undone.\nStep 11: Repeat w/ other shoe Repeat with the other shoe, then hit the road!\nFACT: Shoelaces were invented in 1790.

Always start with a duplicated layer to preserve the original image.  \n\nRefer to the step-by-step guides in [TrickyPhotoshop](https://tricky-photoshop.com/remove-people-in-photoshop/) or [Design Tuts+](https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-remove-a-person-from-a-photo-with-photoshop-cs5s-content-aware-feature--psd-8692) for detailed instructions.", "citations": ["https://www.wikihow.com/Remove-a-Person-from-a-Photo-Using-Photoshop\n", "https://petapixel.com/2015/08/11/video-how-to-easily-remove-unwanted-people-from-a-scene-using-photoshop/", "https://tricky-photoshop.com/remove-people-in-photoshop/", "https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-remove-a-person-from-a-photo-with-photoshop-cs5s-content-aware-feature--psd-8692"], "contexts": ["How to Remove a Person from a Photo Using Photoshop: 15 Steps\nAdobe Photoshop\nEditing Photos Using Photoshop\nHow to Remove a Person from a Photo Using Photoshop\nDownload Article\nSteps\nSteps\nOther Sections\nAsk a Question\nVideo WATCH NOW\nRelated Articles\nArticle Summary\nWritten by Travis Boylls\nLast Updated: May 25, 2021\nPhotoshop is one of the most popular image editing apps around.  One common use for Photoshop is to remove unwanted people or objects from a photo.  You can easily do this using the Clone Stamp tool.  This wikiHow teaches you how to remove a person from a photo.\nSteps\n1\nOpen Photoshop. Photoshop has a blue icon that says \"Ps\" in the center.  Click the icon in your Windows Start menu, or Applications folder on Mac.\nYou need to purchase a monthly subscription to download and use Photoshop.  You can subscribe and download Photoshop from here.  A 7-day free trial is also available.\n2\nOpen a photo you want to edit in Photoshop. You can click Open and select a photo from the title screen in Photoshop.  You can also use the following steps to open a photo anytime in Photoshop:\nClick File in the menu bar at the top.\nClick Open.\nSelect a photo you want to edit.\nClick Open.\n3\nLocate the Layers panel. The Layers panel is typically on the right side in Photoshop.  If you cannot find the Layers panel, use the following steps to open the Layers panel:\nClick Window in the menu at the top.\nClick Layers.\n4\nDuplicate the background layer. When you open a photo in Photoshop, it is displayed as \"Background Layer\" in the layers panel.  When editing a photo, it's a good idea to duplicate the background layer.  That way if you mess up, you can delete the layer and duplicate a new layer from the original and start again.  Use the following steps to duplicate the background layer:\nRight-click Background Layer in the Layers panel.\nClick Duplicate Layer\nClick Ok.\n5\nClick the Clone Stamp tool. The Clone Stamp tool has an icon that resembles a rubber stamp.  It's in the toolbar to the left.  The Clone Stamp tool allows you to sample an area of the background and use it to stamp over a part of a photo you want to remove.\n6\nClick the Brush menu. The Brush menu is next to the icon that resembles a Clone Stamp tool icon in the upper-left corner.  It usually has an icon of a solid or faded circle (or whichever brush is currently selected).  Click this icon to display the Brush menu.\n7\nSelect a circle brush. You can use any one of the basic circle brushes with the Clone Stamp tool.\n8\nAdjust the size of the brush. Use the slider bar below \"Size\" to adjust the size of the brush. Make sure your brush is big enough to stamp over a large area of the person you want to remove.\nAlternatively, you can adjust the size of the brush while working by press \"[\" or \"]\" on your keyboard.\n9\nAdjust the hardness of the brush. Hardness indicates how solid your brush strokes will be.  A softer brush will produce more transparent edges.  The Clone Stamp tool usually works better with a softer brush.  Drag the slider bar below \"Hardness\" to adjust the hardness of the brush.  It is recommended you set your hardness below 50% and closer to 0%.\n10\nSample the background next to the person you want to remove. Make sure you sample an area that is as close to the person you want to remove without sampling any part of them. To sample an area, hold the Alt or Option key and click the area you want to sample.\n11\nClick over the person you want to remove. Just click once to stamp over the person. This will stamp over the person with the area you sampled. Make sure you click right next to the area you sampled to keep your stamps consistent with the background.\n12\nSample a new area. Hold Alt or Option and click to sample a new area next to the person you want to remove.\n13\nClick over the person you want to remove. This will stamp over another section of the person you want to remove.\n14\nRepeat until you completely remove the person. Keep sampling areas next to the person you want to remove and stamping over them until they are gone.  Pay close attention to the background.  Try to keep the areas you stamp as consistent with the background as possible.\n15\nSave your image. After you finish editing the image, you'll want to make sure sure you save it as an image format you can use.  Use the following steps to save your image:\nClick File.\nClick Save as...\nSelect \"JPEG\" using the drop-down menu next to \"Format\".\nEnter a name for the image next to \"File name:\".\nClick Save.\nwikiHow Video: How to Remove a Person from a Photo Using Photoshop\nWatch\nCommunity Q&A\nAsk a Question\nSubmit\nAbout This Article\nWritten by:\nTravis Boylls\nwikiHow Technology Writer\nThis article was written by Travis Boylls.

Almost, every second out of ten requests is to remove a person in a photo. The person could be a stranger in a vacation photo, someone’s ex, or any unwanted person. So, I decided that I should write the best tutorial on how to remove people in Photoshop.\nLet’s begin. I want to tell you in advance that this is going to be a long tutorial because I will be showing you four ways to remove people in Photoshop.\nTable of Contents\n1: What is Photoshop?\n2: Why should you remove a person in Photoshop?\n3: Video of all of the methods\n4: Remove People Using Spot Healing Brush tool\nStep 1: Duplicate the layer\nStep 2: Remove the person using Spot Healing Brush tool in Photoshop\n5: Remove People Using the Patch tool\nStep 1: Duplicate the layer\nStep 2: Remove the person using the Patch tool in Photoshop\n6: Remove People Using Content-Aware Fill tool\nStep 1: Duplicate the layer\nStep 2: Remove the person using the Content Aware Fill tool in Photoshop\n7: Remove People Using Clone Stamp tool\nStep 1: Create a new layer\nStep 2: Remove the person using the Clone Stamp tool in Photoshop\n1: What is Photoshop?\nIt quick Google search shows that Photoshop alters digital images. Be it\nchanging the brightness\nremoving the people\nremoving the background\nadding people\nremoving fat\nreplacing the sky\nor even designing a website\nPhotoshop can do it.\nPhotoshop software is owned by Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE).\n2: Why should you remove a person in Photoshop?\nYou’ve shot a great photo but some unwanted people in the background ruined the photo. Damn!\nA child is meeting his daddy and two strangers are there in the photo. Damn! Why anyone would not want to remove them?\n3: Video of all of the methods\nI have created a video where I removed people using all methods that I am going to talk about in this tutorial.\nRemove People in Photoshop in 4 Different Ways\nWatch on\n4: Remove People Using Spot Healing Brush tool\nComplexity: Easy-peasy\nTime required: <1 minute to remove one person with in easy background\nWhen it comes down to remove people in Photoshop, Spot Healing brush tool does a decent job as long as the background is nice and simple.\nLet’s say I want to remove the person in the background that I highlighted with the Yellow color in Fig. 2.\nI’ll show you how to remove the person now.\nStep 1: Duplicate the layer\nWe want our editing to be non-destructive which means that we’re going to edit our image is such a way that our original photo should not be impacted. This helps when one messes up and want to go back to the original image.\nOpen the Layer panel by going to Window > Layer or press F7 . Press Cmd + J/Ctrl + J to duplicate the background layer.\nStep 2: Remove the person using Spot Healing Brush tool in Photoshop\nGrab the Spot Healing Brush tool from the tool panel or press Shift + J again and again until it activates.\nBrush on the person who you want to remove.\nHere you go. Tell me where is that guy?\nHere’s the GIF for you.\nFig. 7\nIf you think that the Spot Healing Brush tool did not remove the person entirely then you can brush on the unwanted person as many times as you want to completely remove him.\n5: Remove People Using the Patch tool\nComplexity: Easy-peasy\nTime required: <1 minute to remove one person in an easy background\nThe next tool that you can use to remove people is the Patch tool. Removing people using this tool is also easy-peasy.\nStep 1: Duplicate the layer\nDuplicate the layer by pressing Cmd + J / Ctrl + J. Press Shift + J again and again until it comes.\nStep 2: Remove the person using the Patch tool in Photoshop\nDraw a rough selection across the person you want to remove.\nNow, drag the selection to the area which you want to fill in the person’s place. Here, I am going to drag the selection to the area which I want to use to fill the person’s area.\nBelow is the photo after my first attempt.\nIf doing it the first time didn’t give you the perfect result, do it multiple times. Here’s the final photo.\nHere’s the GIF for you.\n6: Remove People Using Content-Aware Fill tool\nComplexity: Medium\nTime required: 1-2 minutes to remove one person with an easy background\nThe next tool that you can use to remove people is the Content Aware Fill tool. Removing people using this tool is also easy to medium. This tool is added in Photoshop CC 2019 which was launched in the last quarter of 2018. You can skip this method if you don’t have Photoshop CC 2019.\nStep 1: Duplicate the layer\nDuplicate the layer by pressing Cmd + J / Ctrl + J.\nStep 2: Remove the person using the Content Aware Fill tool in Photoshop\nGrab the Lasso tool or press Shift + L again and again until it comes.\nRoughly select the person you want to remove.\nGo to Edit > Content Aware Fill. Make the settings like the ones shown in the below screenshot. The green color on the left-hand side shows the area that Photoshop will use to artificially create the background. Right side shows how the image would look like. Press OK.\nDo this multiple times to remove all the unwanted people. Here’s the GIF for you.\n7: Remove People Using Clone Stamp tool\nComplexity: Hard\nTime required: 4-5 minutes to remove one person with a cluttered background\nTime to use some advance tool to remove people in Photoshop. Many professionals and I use this tool to remove people in Photoshop. We’re going to use the Clone Stamp tool. This tool basically clones the pixels from area to the other.\nStep 1: Create a new layer\nCreate a new layer by going to Layer > New > Layer or press Cmd + Shift + N / Ctrl +Shift + N.\nStep 2: Remove the person using the Clone Stamp tool in Photoshop\nGrab the Clone Stamp tool from the tool panel or press Shift + S again and again until it comes.\nNow, we need to remove the two girls. We know that there are sea and sand in the background. We’re going to clone that sea and sand on the girls.\nThe Clone Stamp tool has two cursors. One is the target and another is the source. The Source shows from where the pixels are being cloned from and the target shows the area on which pixels are being cloned.\nHold down Opt / Alt to choose the target. I am going to select the sea first. As soon as you hold down the Opt / Alt key, the cursor will change. Check the below screenshot. This is how your cursor would look like.\nNow, start brushing on the girl.\nChange the source multiple times.\nHere’s one GIF for you. Sorry that I had to increase the speed to 3 times to make the GIF shorter. Otherwise, GIF would have been of 22 MB.\nPrevious 14 Best Websites to Download Free Icons\nNext How to Install & Use Photoshop Brushes?", "How To Remove a Person From a Photo in Photoshop\nDesign & Illustration\nPhoto Effects\nHow To Remove a Person From a Photo in Photoshop Using Content Aware Fill\nby Martin Sitar May 28, 2010\nRead Time: 8 mins Languages:\nPhoto Effects Tools & Tips Image Editing Photography Adobe Photoshop\nWhat You'll Be Creating\nIn this Photoshop remove object tutorial, you'll learn how to remove unwanted objects in Photoshop using the Content Aware Fill tool. This feature allows you to quickly fill in a selection with surrounding content making it look like a part of the original image.\nIn this case we will choose to remove a person from a photo, this can be done in less than five minutes. With the additional image enhancements this tutorial will take you less than 10 minutes to complete.\nYou'll learn to remove objects from photo in Photoshop pretty easily. But what if you need a faster or more professional solution? In that case, your best bet are premium Photoshop actions.\nRemoving unwanted objects in Photoshop is easier with this premium action.\nScroll down after this tutorial to find some top Photoshop remove object actions from Envato Elements and GraphicRiver.\nWhat You'll Learn In This Photoshop Remove Object Tutorial\nHow to remove a person from a photo in Photoshop\nHow to use the content aware fill tool\nHow to remove unwanted objects in Photoshop\nWhat You'll Need\nBefore we begin, you can download the image we'll use in this tutorial, or use your own. As you can see, there are two individuals in this photo. In today's tutorial, we will use Photoshop CS5's Content Aware Feature to remove the man on the left.\n1. Open the Picture In Photoshop\nUsing the content aware tool on different images produces different results. An image with a gradient background such as the sky in this image is quite tricky to work with. Let's begin by opening your selected image in Photoshop.\n2. Mark The Object with the Pen Tool\nWe are extracting the person on the left from this photo. Using the Pen Tool, (P) Begin by making a path around the subject. The nice thing about using content aware is that you do not have to be exact when making a selection. In fact, do your best not to cut too close to the subject.\nNotice in the image below how far I am drawing the path from the subject. Try to keep this distance all the way around. If you go too close, Content Aware will take pixels from the subject. If you cut too far it will take pixels from the woman on the right.\n3. Turn The Object Into a Selection\nOnce you complete the path around the subject, turn it into a selection. This can be done by right clicking on the path and selecting Make Selection.\nA dialog box will pop-up, make sure the feathering is set to 0px. Leave all other options as they are. Click OK.\n4. Disappear The Object with Content Aware Fill\nNow we have an active selection around our subject. In this step we will make the subject disappear from the image using Content Aware Fill. To do this, go to Edit > Fill.\nA dialog box will pop-up, make sure the Content Aware option is selected. Blending mode is set to normal and the opacity is at 100%. Hit OK.\nYou can cancel the selection at any time by making another selection or just clicking anywhere else on the page with any selection tool.\n5. Remove Remaining Elements From the Picture\nIn this step we will remove some of the other artifacts in the image using the same process. The content aware tool did miss a spot where the subject’s foot originally was. To do this, draw a rectangle around the area using the rectangle selection tool. And use the content aware fill as we have done in the previous steps.\nNow let’s remove the people towards the right of the image. Create a rectangle selection around them and use the steps we just demonstrated to remove them.\n6. Crop The Picture (Optional)\nUsing the Crop Tool (C) lets crop the image so that the focus is drawn to the woman jumping. To do this, just crop out an area of the image that you would like to keep. Beware of the shadow that is left behind from the person that we have removed. You can use the Content Aware feature to remove this shadow but I have decided to crop it out altogether.\nClick the checkmark at the top to keep this area. Photoshop will discard the content that is outside of your crop area.\n7. Enhance The Final Picture (Optional)\nIn this step we will enhance the photo by giving it a more vibrant look. The colors currently appear somewhat dull. There are many ways to accomplish this but we will use Color Curves. To do this, go to Image > Adjustments > Curves, (Cmd + M). A dialog box will pop-up and we will select each of the channels, R, G, B and work on them separately. Select the Red channel from the dropdown menu.\nWe are going to make two points on the graph. One in the bottom of the top right square, and one in the top of the bottom left square.\nOnce you have made these points, make sure you enter the values for each. For the top right point the Output value is 199, and the input value is 185. For the bottom point the values are 56 and 68, respectively. You can play around with these setting and adjust them to whatever you feel is appropriate. Repeat this for each of the colors, Green and Blue.\nWell Done! You Learned How To Remove a Person From a Photo In Photoshop\nYour image should now look something like the one below. As you can see, we have removed the man on her left with very little effort using Photoshop's Content Aware Feature. Remove a person from a picture in Photoshop is easy following these steps. Keep practicing and experimenting with more pictures!\n3 Top Photoshop Remove Object Actions To Use In 2021\nNow you know how to remove unwanted objects in Photoshop from scratch.

Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Engine Roles**: Starship has three **sea-level engines** (used for landing on Earth) and three **vacuum-optimized engines** (for space travel). The vacuum engines cannot gimbal (adjust direction), so they are not used for landing. However, all engines must fire during ascent to maintain control authority, as the vacuum engines cannot adjust thrust direction for maneuvering [1]. \n\n2. **Redundancy for Landing**: At least one sea-level engine must fire for a successful landing. If fewer than three engines fire, the vehicle risks losing control or failing to land safely [1]. The three sea-level engines provide redundancy to handle potential failures.\n\n3. **Test Flights**: During early test flights (e.g., SN8's triple-engine static fire), only three engines are used for simplicity and to validate performance. However, the full configuration (all six engines) is planned for later flights, with the Super Heavy booster adding 28 engines for liftoff [3]. \n\nIn summary, all engines are required during launch to ensure control and landing safety, with the three sea-level engines critical for Earth landings. Initial tests may use fewer engines, but the full configuration is part of the development process.", "citations": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/StarshipDevelopment/comments/p6z6qh/number_of_engines_in_the_starship/", "https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/54684/why-is-it-not-concerning-from-a-cost-perspective-to-have-so-many-engines-on-star", "https://www.inverse.com/innovation/spacex-starship-watch-triple-engine-fire"], "contexts": ["Number of engines in the starship : StarshipDevelopment\n2\nPosted by\nu/Middle-Coach-442\n5 months ago\nNumber of engines in the starship\nWill the starship ever need to fire the sea level and the vacuum engines at the same time?

I don't even think it would be manageable, as you'd have to have a very complex mechanism for the varying diameter and on top of that, it has to be cooled somehow. Making regenerative cooling work is hard enough on its own, now imagine that in a complex, moving mechanism.\nI am no rocket scientist by any means, but I'd also imagine that you wouldn't really get the expansion ratios - not to mention the other properties like chamber pressure, flow rate, etc. - needed for a efficient vacuum engine with that method, as the throat can only be that small without screwing up the other properties. And it would have to be really small to be efficient/ have a good expansion ratio alongside a more or less standard sized nozzle.\n8\nlevel 2\nMiddle-Coach-442\nOp · 5 mo. ago\nI didn’t think about the cooling.

This applies to Earth-to-Earth travel as well as space travel.\nJetliners started with 4 engines, but have since migrated to using 2, regardless of size. Where the number of engines might have been increased for an earlier generation of wide-body aircraft, now, as with the 777X, companies simply make larger engines for every new design. This twinjet configuration is chosen for saving costs, as each engine requires separate service, paperwork, and certificates.\nWhy does the same not apply to Starship?\npropulsion spacex-starship design-alternative\nImprove this question\nedited Aug 23 2021 at 9:58\nMehdi Abbassi\n235 7\nasked Aug 20 2021 at 13:11\nAbdullah\n1,059 1 5 21\nI suspect you have answered your own question here - available tech forces us closer to the 'six turning four burning' of  the B-36 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convair_B-36_Peacemaker than 777X\n–\nAug 20 2021 at 13:41\nThe simple answer is that rocket flight has extremely little in common with airflight.  For one, the amortized cost of rocket per flight vs fuel costs are not at all comparable to the amortized cost of a 777 vs fuel (and it's much less analogous when looking at F9). But also the flight profiles and stresses introduced are entirely different as well. Aug 20 2021 at 22:59\nSimiarly, a F1 racecar has a much different engine and shape and has little in common to a highly efficient 4 cylinder honda. Aug 20 2021 at 23:11\nAircraft companies don't really make significantly larger engines for each new generation, they generally build smaller airplanes.  For instance, the 777X you reference is considerably smaller than the 4-engined 747, while the larger than 747 Airbus A380 uses 4 engines.

High up-front cost, but low unit cost per engine once the process is perfected.\nThe larger the engines, the higher the up-front cost would be, as problems of combustion stability, cooling, material durability and so on crop up; this is a well-known problem of massive engines, one that buried Soviets' plan of manned moon landing too.\nThen there is the problem of production errors - e.g. faulty 3D prints, problems that become apparent in tests after print completion. Let's say the 3D printer has 1 in 10 chance it will glitch once on given day, producing a fault that ruins the currently printed engine. If the engine is smaller, and takes 1 day to complete the print, one in 10 engines will be faulty, 10% work time of the printer wasted, 10% of production lost. Now increase the engine size, so it takes 2 days to print. Same chance of a glitch ruining it, but now two days are wasted, one engine in five is a reject, and twice as much of materials is wasted with each rejection. That automatically means per-unit cost of the engines is increased, as the loss due to the faulty one is spread between four good ones, instead of nine.\nThen there's the matter of redundancy. If you have, say, 15 engines, 2 or 3 flaming out won't mean loss of mission. If you have two and lose one, you won't be going to space today.\nThe aviation industry is way more mature now - in the beginning they did use many smaller engines because scaling that much up simply wasn't technologically viable - and also for reasons similar as with SpaceX currently, economy of scale, reliability, redundancy. With constant, steady stream of revenue from existing production of smaller engines, innovation, improvements in safety and reliability, and active competition, they were able to develop incrementally larger and more powerful engines without running at \"infant mortality\" problems of new production, where before it becomes profitable, there are a lot of problems to solve and costs to bear.\nImprove this answer\nanswered Aug 20 2021 at 14:29\nSF.\n51.9k 10 151 321\nThe chance of a glitch ruining the engine is higher for the larger engine, 20 % instead of 10 % for the smaller one.

If you'd increase the gap of an oil lubricated gliding bearing, you'd need to pump much more oil into it and do so at a higher pressure to keep the parts from touching. The oil film does not care how big the parts are, as long as there is a thin film of oil all around. As such, it would be much more prudent to increase the number of oil channels feeding the bearing, and keep the gap size the same if possible. Size changes due to temperature may force bigger gaps, though. Aug 20 2021 at 22:01\nI think with more trustable drives the larger ones would be not only more economic, but also more effective. A drive capable to create double thrust would likely weight lesser than twice, and also producing it would cost lesser than twice. Aug 21 2021 at 11:24\n@peterh \"Better is the enemy of good\".

A single General Electric GE9X as used by the Boeing 777 costs 44.5 million dollars. Each! Whereas each engine on a 747 only costs about 13 million, yet produces 60% as much thrust each.\nThe huge engines on a 777 are selected because they offer better fuel economy than multiple smaller engines, and slightly less maintenance cost.\nUnfortunately, rocket engines are nowhere near the maturity of development that airliner turbofan engines have.\nImprove this answer\nanswered Aug 20 2021 at 14:35\nCuteKItty_pleaseStopBArking\n1\nI wonder how that relates to Musk's claims, that design is easy, production is difficult. Aug 20 2021 at 17:25\n@SF. mass production is difficult, producing an individual engine isn't so hard. The individual engines are actually pretty simple and easy to build in comparison to jet engines. SpaceX's Raptor is estimated to have oxygen preburner temperatures of ~800 K, compared to ~2300 K for a turbojet's combustor. Pressures are high and fluids are dense, so the turbines and pumps are much smaller, and there's a huge flow of propellant for cooling. You see some carefully chosen metallurgy, but not the single-crystal superalloy turbine blades with integrated cooling channels you see in jet engines. Aug 20 2021 at 18:25\nI was specifically referring to turbojets as being more similar to a rocket engine's turbopumps (particularly in a full-flow engine like Raptor) and to avoid confusion with the large but low-temperature fans of turbofans. Aug 21 2021 at 13:06\nTurbojet engines also operate at Thrust-to-weight ratios that are way, way WAY WAY less than those for rocket engines. A GE90 engine has a TWR of 6, a Merlin 1Dvac has a TWR that is 30 times better. (mostly because the turbojet's focus is not TWR, but Fuel economy, while the rocket is all about Thrust and ISP)\n–\nAug 21 2021 at 17:37\nMusk and OP are using \"design\" in two different ways. Musk means actual design of the actual rocket. OP is including manufacturing design in the term \"design\". Production is difficult--that's why it's better to spread that cost of figuring out how to actually build the engine over 500 engines instead of 50.

One working sea level engine out of the set of three is required for landing on Earth; failure to light at least one engine guarantees destruction of the vehicle. The vacuum engines are not usable here.\nUnlike an airliner, the engines are turned off during most of the descent and only start a few seconds before landing, which adds a large risk factor (as the development flights of Starship have shown painfully). Furthermore, an airliner even has a good chance to land with zero working engines. So the landing modes just aren't directly comparable, and the actual 3:1 redundancy isn't excessive.\nSuper Heavy, on the other hand, mounts 29 engines. Here, the driver is engine commonality with the upper stage and economy of scale. SpaceX only has to develop one really good methane engine, and then concentrate on how to reduce production costs over a large number of them.\nImprove this answer\nedited Aug 21 2021 at 18:23\nanswered Aug 20 2021 at 15:24\nRussell Borogove\n158k 10 557 659\n1\nStarship specifically. 6 is still rather more than 2 Aug 20 2021 at 15:26\nBut only 3 can be used for landing.\n–\nAug 20 2021 at 15:26\nWell, they better learn to make do with 2, cuz the rest of us below the karman line have to :)\n–\nAug 20 2021 at 15:29\n11\nAirliners know well before descent if their engines are working correctly, and even have a fighting chance at landing with zero working engines.

When a gliding airliner gets near an airport, they tend to succeed, and many off-airport landings result in flyaways also (TACA 110 @ NASA Michoud; Alrosa 514).  The only way dual engine fail crashes an airliner is \"too soon after takeoff\" (Sully), using an approach guide slope below the airplane's unpowered glide slope (British Airways 38) or somewhere no airport is within glide range (Air Transat 236; Pinnacle 3701; Transair 810).  Note every one of the latter group includes blunders.\n–\nAug 21 2021 at 0:59\nShow 2 more comments\n5\nOthers have already mentioned the advantages in redundancy and manufacturing scale. Other advantages:\nIt's structurally more efficient to place engines near the skin of the vehicle. The Superheavy booster in particular takes advantage of this, with its outer ring of engines actually protruding somewhat beyond the diameter of the vehicle.\nUsing a large number of engines makes it much easier to achieve a wide effective throttle range by shutting engines down, which is important for recovery of the vehicle.\nSmaller, lighter engines are easier to transport and handle. Raptors are small enough to be moved around with forklifts, which makes them easier to install or swap out.\nSmaller engines are easier to test. Engine test stands are smaller, and vehicles can test fire single engines or subsets of their engines.\nSmaller engines are less likely to inflict severe damage on the vehicle in the event of a major failure.\nA large number of smaller engines is actually quieter, due to how incoherent noise sources add together. In short, with the same total sound power, the multiple incoherent sources will partially cancel each other out, resulting in lower average pressure levels.\nThe same goes for vibrations internal to the vehicle. People who've flown on both Crew Dragon and the Shuttle have remarked about how smooth the portion of the flight powered by the 9-engine booster was in comparison, and how the 1-engine upper stage actually felt rougher than the Shuttle.\nImprove this answer\nanswered Aug 21 2021 at 18:00\nChristopher James Huff\n7,674 1 22 35\n\"Raptors are small enough to be moved around with forklifts, which makes them easier to install or swap out.\" – Indeed. SpaceX has improved installation times tremendously. Just one year ago, it took roughly a day to install an engine, a couple of weeks ago, they installed all 29 engines on B4 in one night. (Although that was only a fit check, so it might be the case that the plumbing was not hooked.) The engine installation before the static fire test of B3 took only about an hour per engine. Aug 24 2021 at 12:34\nAdd a comment\n1\nAs airline safety improved, they focused more on cost. Without safety, cost didn't matter. SpaceX engineers asked \"what's the largest engine we can make and still have room for vacuum engines and multi-engine-out capability for landing?\" The answer was the current engine size of raptor. There were more factors, but that's the gist.\nNext, since engines are so expensive, they decided to mass produce that size. Mass production leads to innovations in cost and quality, which should increase safety.\nLastly, you want max thrust on liftoff to reduce fuel costs. So you pack the booster full of them, which ends up being 29-32 engines. That plus 3 on the ship and 6 more with vacuum nozzles means 38-41 total, which is a lot.\nAs safety is proven and technology improves, we may see fewer, larger engines on Starship V2. Bigger has historically meant more efficient, and fewer might lead to lower cost. But by then 3D printing or some other innovation might make fewer/bigger engines a bad strategy. Time will tell.\nImprove this answer\nanswered Aug 23 2021 at 12:32\nDexterious22\n11 1\nI might not be very bright, but I don't see what additional facts (apart from speculations) this answer has brought, to what the OP question has already hinted at, and to what others have already answered. Aug 23 2021 at 13:43\nThe last paragraph is roughly what happened with aircraft jet engines.  The 747-100 needed four engines partly due to the tech limit on how powerful an engine could be, and partly due to the tech limit on how reliable an engine could be. Aug 23 2021 at 15:55\nAdd a comment\n-2\nLet's say you want to build a big rocket (or airplane). You're going to need a lot of thrust. You can get a lot of thrust from a bunch of small engines or just a few big ones. Now, we know that more engines are more expensive than fewer engines, right?\nBut wait! How many rockets are we going to build? Probably not a lot. Of the heavy lift rockets, there have only been 13 Saturn Vs, 5 Shuttles, 2 Energias, and probably will only ever be 10 SLS(es?). Let's consider Starship--it's going to be reusable, so even though Musk wants a crazy launch rate, there's probably not ever going to be more than 15-30 built.\nSo what if we put only a few massive engines on each of our vehicles? There's probably going to ever be 50 (at most!) built. While that's not quite low enough that basically every engine will be hand-crafted, it's going to be pretty close. Building the tooling to make a rocket engine will always be very expensive, and with only 50 engines to divide that cost over, each engine is going to be wildly pricey.\nLet's compare this to aircraft engines. The PW4000 and the GE90, two of the most common engines you'll find in a Boeing 777, have each had over 2,500 manufactured--and recall, this is on a century's worth of incremental work into jet engine manufacture by P&W and GE. Much of their tooling is probably shared with previous engines. These are far, far cheaper a peace than the 50 engines you're planning on building.\nSo when building a rocket, a market in which volume is very low and development costs are very high, it's actually more expensive to use fewer engines, because so few of them will ever be built. It makes more sense to develop a smaller engine--something which (we haven't mentioned this yet) is MUCH easier to design & validate than a very large engine--and just make a bunch of them.\nNote: we haven't even mentioned the redundancy issues yet--if one of 20 engines dies, it's not that big a deal. If one of 4 engines die, you're not going to space today.\nAfterthoughts: if we ever get to the point where there's 100s or 1000s of rockets being built a year, and engine design has matured to be very reliable, I expect you'll start to see only a few engines per rocket. But we're building 10s (at ABSOLUTE best!) of rockets per year.\nImprove this answer\nanswered Aug 22 2021 at 1:03\nAnton Hengst\n9,199 25 65\n\"there's probably not ever going to be more than 15-30 built\" – Elon Musk estimated they need about 1000 Starships.

It is the first time that a Starship prototype has fired three engines as the same time, and it could be one of the last hurdles before the ship launches to new heights.\nStarship is pivotal to SpaceX's future plans. The company aims to fly the ship the Moon, Mars, and beyond, with a fully-reusable design powered by liquid oxygen and methane. So far, prototypes, equipped with one engine, have flown up to 500 feet in the air. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk declared this new model could reach much higher — 15 kilometers, or around 50,000 feet.\nThe final model will reach greater heights. The ship will be equipped with three sea-level engines, just like SN8, and will also offer three larger vacuum Raptors for navigating space. The Super Heavy booster, which will lift the ship out of Earth's atmosphere, adds a further 28 engines to the base.\nThe ship itself measures around 160 feet tall and 30 feet wide, but when paired with the booster the whole ship will measure around 400 feet.\nThe latest firing brings this moment a little bit closer. Watch the video below:\nThis is unlikely to be the last static firing before launch. Musk explained last month that the team will complete checkouts after the first firing, before firing a second time ahead of the flight.\nThe advances have sparked the imagination of a community of artists and fans. Minnesota-based 3D artist Bart Caldwell shared a rendering last week that imagined what SN8 will look like when it launches. Caldwell explained the project \"has got me dreaming again and feeling inspired about the future which is really important for me as a person and as an artist.\" Musk himself described Caldwell's latest work as \"great.\"\nSpaceX plans higher and higher flights ahead of a future attempt to reach orbit, tentatively slated for 2021. Speaking at the Mars Society annual convention last week, Musk suggested that it's not a certainty.\n“I’m 80 to 90 percent that we will reach orbit with Starship next year,\" Musk said. \"I think probably 50 percent confident we’ll be able to bring the ship and the booster back.”\nThose first flights with the booster are unlikely to feature the full number of engines — Musk says they're more likely to attach around two or four engines to the booster instead of the full 28.\nFrom there, SpaceX aims to hold full flights as early as 2022. The first cargo ships, designed to support a future crewed mission, could reach Mars by 2024. This is all in preparation for building a million-strong city by 2050.\nThe Inverse analysis — SpaceX's tests are becoming more visually dramatic. From single-engine flights with the miniaturized Starhopper back in August 2019, to sending up silo-shaped ships 12 months later, the concepts depicted in art on the company's website are slowly coming to life.\nAlthough Musk didn't share the feat on his Twitter page — which seems to be his preferred method of revealing news — the static fire news spread like wildfire thanks to footage from NASASpaceflight and fans in the Reddit and Twitter communities.\nWith SpaceX expected to host a Starship-focused event sometime this month, it seems fans can't wait to see what comes next.\nTHE STARSHIP’S JOURNEY, SUMMARIZED\nNovember 2018 – BFR, first announced in September 2017, gets renamed to Starship.\nDecember 2018 – Musk confirms the new ship has switched to stainless steel.\nJanuary 2019 – Shortened “Starhopper” prototype unveiled and Musk explains the switch to steel.\nFebruary 2019 – Raptor engine beats a long-standing rocket record.\nApril 2019 – Starhopper completes a tethered “hop.”\nJuly 2019 – Starhopper launches 20 meters (67 feet).\nAugust 2019 – Starhopper launches 150 meters (500 feet).\nSeptember 2019 – Starship Mk.1 full-size prototype unveiled.\nMay 2020 – Starship SN4 full-size prototype completes a static test fire.\nAugust 2020 – Starship SN5 launches 150 meters (500 feet).\nOctober 2020 – Starship SN8 completes the first triple-Raptor static fire."]}

You’ll need to strip off those pretty skins for many a dish this fall and winter. How do you do it? Do you use a paring knife? Or one of those fancy peelers that rotates the apple like a rotisserie chicken? We’ve got our preferred method—see the photos, below—and we’d love to hear yours.\nWe like to use a vegetable peeler to skin our apples; it spares more flesh than a paring knife (we’re always getting hasty and taking off too much apple with the peel when we use a knife), and it’s fast and efficient. Especially if you pull it towards you rather than slashing away from your body. You’ll have more control that way.\nAs we rarely have need for a whole, peeled apple, we like to cut ours into quarters before peeling. Then we pull the peeler horizontally across the top of the chunk, taking off a tiny strip (about 1/4-inch), just to give us a place for the peeler to “grab” when we start peeling downward.\n(Image credit: Apartment Therapy)\nThen we simply pull the peeler down vertically, taking off 1/2-inch strips as we go.\n(Image credit: Apartment Therapy)\nOnce the chunk is peeled, we’ll do the same horizontal move across the bottom to remove the final bit of peel.\n(Image credit: Apartment Therapy)\nSo, that’s what works for us.

For those unfamiliar with the term, paring and peeling mean the same thing when referring to apples. Wait until just before preparing the apples to pare them, as they will brown when exposed to air.

You can make this task go by much more quickly if you use something from your tool box—your literal tool box, that is.\nAll you need is a power drill and a regular vegetable peeler. Clean off a spade (aka butterfly) bit and insert it into the bottom of the fruit (be sure you wash your apples properly beforehand). Turn on the drill as you hold the peeler against the apple and watch the peel fly!\nVideo Loading\nKeep in mind that it's going to take practice to get good at this. See how pastry chef Jasper van Ramhorst does it.\nVideo Loading\nThere's also the added benefit of coring the apples with the spade bit, which you can do after the peeling is done. Just be extremely careful with the hand holding the apple. If you're not comfortable with drills, do not attempt to core them this way!\nOverall, this drilling method works way faster than these hand-turned skinner, corer, and slicer combo contraptions. If you have one of these, you surely have a huge kitchen, or at least a decent garage to store junk in.\nVideo Loading\nNow that you know this quick way to peel mass quantities of apples, find out easier, faster ways you can peel a bulb of garlic; individual cloves; potatoes, oranges, and bananas; hard-boiled eggs; even Hershey's Kisses.\nAnd if you really want to impress people, split apples with your bare hands.\nWant to master Microsoft Excel and take your work-from-home job prospects to the next level?

The smell of apples baking in warm spices and bubbling in a sugary syrup is almost – I said almost – as satisfying as digging into a slice of Fresh Apple Cake or a serving of homemade apple pie. When I plan to make an apple dessert, however, my hands automatically cramp up when I think about peeling the 4 to 5 pounds of apples necessary for the recipe. It's well worth the effort but knowing the easiest way to peel and core an apple can save you a lot of pain.\nWhat You Need\nHave you heard about using a power drill to peel apples? It looks simple enough, but you may not like getting apple pulp all over the drill and drill bits. Instead of power tools, you can get the job done with three simple tools: a Y-shaped peeler, a chef's knife, and a cutting board (to protect your countertops).\nHow to Peel\nUsing a vegetable peeler is the easiest and most efficient way to quickly get rid of the skin, but a paring knife can also do the trick.\nUsing a Y-shaped peeler, start by peeling off the top and bottom of your apple. This gives you a good start and end point for the rest of your peeling process and helps stabilize the apple by creating a flat bottom.\nMake your way around the apple, peeling away from your body for safety, until the entire apple is peeled.\nDiscard the skin of the apple (or reserve the peelings to make Apple Peel and Core Jelly .) You now have a perfectly peeled apple that is ready to be cut.\nWATCH: Tasty Tricks for Leftover Apple Peels\nHow to Core\nHollowing out the center of an apple – or coring –can be done a variety of ways, depending on what tools you have on hand. Here are three easy ways to core an apple.\nUse an apple corer: The single purpose of this tool is to core an apple. Just push it through, twist and lift it back out to easily remove the center of your apple.\nUse a melon baller: Cut the apple in half first, then use the melon baller to take out the seeds and create a perfectly round, hollow center.\nUse a paring knife: Take a sharp paring knife and either hollow out a whole apple, cut the apple in half or into quarters, and use the knife to scoop out the centers."]}

Modern Family's creators outright characterize the show as a \"a family comedy shot documentary-style\", and that there's no actual documentary being filmed in the Modern Family universe.\nFun fact: before it was shot, Modern Family actually did have a documentary filmmaker in-universe - it was a foreign exchange student living with one of the families (can't remember which).

At some point in all of their histories The Office, Parks and Recreation and Modern Family were all to be shot in this style. The Office made it a part of the plot, having the characters try to ditch the camera crew or forget to turn their mics on. P&R started as an Office spin-off, but then when Amy Poehler came on, they re-did the whole show but kept the mockumentary style. Then they just kinda dropped it altogether, but people still acknowledge and speak to the camera.\nModern Family was going to have an exchange student be the one filming, but they liked the interview style and kept with it.

Scroll down to read as we spot the similarities and the differences between the two!\n‘ The Office’ premiered its series finale seven years ago but is still one of the most talked-about shows today. Unlike Ricky Gervais’s two-season UK version that it was inspired from, the Steve Carell starring mockumentary series went on to make 9 seasons. Its soaring popularity and transformation into a global phenomenon often posed a question regarding its ability to spawn a spinoff.\nHighlights —\nThe similarities between ‘The Office’ and ‘Modern Family’\nHow ‘Modern Family’ copied ‘The Office’\n‘Modern Family’ did not want an ending like ‘The Office’\n‘Modern Family’ arrived on our television screens in late 2009 and ended its eleven series run in April this year. Its premise is different from ‘The Office’, which depicted the everyday work lives of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company employees. ‘Modern Family’ follows three modern-day families who find themselves in hilarious situations while dealing with their kids, spouses, and jobs.\nPause Play\n% buffered 00:00\n-10:06\nUnmute Mute\nDisable captions Enable captions\nSettings\nPIP\nExit fullscreen Enter fullscreen\nTop 10 Memorable Modern Family Guest Stars\nShare\nPlay\nFans of ‘The Office’ and ‘Modern Family’ have discovered similarities between the shows, between their characters, the style, and format. ‘Modern Family’ seems to have been heavily inspired by ‘The Office’, but it certainly didn’t want an ending like it. Keep reading to learn about their similarities, spinoff scandals, and why ‘Modern Family’ didn’t want an ending like ‘The Office’.\nThe similarities between ‘The Office’ and ‘Modern Family’\nJust like ‘The Office’, ‘Modern Family’ employs a faux-documentary style storytelling device, with the characters addressing the audience, by looking at the camera. They’ve often looked at the camera and offered commentary, told stories, and engaged in confessional moments. It’s a clever format that keeps the viewer intrigued, but it isn’t helpful if it reminds them of ‘The Office’!\nTheir principal characters, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell) are quite alike! They share the same energy, enthusiasm, and the unwavering inability to understand innuendos and sarcasm. Michael and Phil have a goofy nature that makes them likeable, even though their personality traits might differ.\nThe Office Modern Family\n‘The Office’ is mostly filmed around the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company office setting, but ‘Modern Family’ follows its characters on their travels. They’re both popular in their own right, with The Office’s quirky characters and Modern Family’s elegant depiction of modern-day families. But there’s an underlying reason behind the constant comparisons of the two shows, and it might surprise you.\nHow ‘Modern Family’ copied ‘The Office’\nWith ‘The Office’ achieving success all over the world, the producers and team at NBC began to think of spinoff ideas. It made perfect sense: the characters were popular, and the show was loved enough for its spinoff to garner eyeballs. Justin Spitzer, who was a writer on the series, began developing the idea for a spinoff and came up with ‘Parks and Recreation’. ‘The Office’ team shared some insider scoop about the spinoff with Andy Greene. Their thoughts were recorded in Greene’s book “The Office: The Untold Story of the Greatest Sitcom of the 2000s”.\ntheoffice Verified\n2M followers\nView profile\ntheoffice Verified\n516 posts\n                  ·\n                  2M followers\nView more on Instagram\nComment Share Save\n38,753 likes\ntheoffice\nEverybody stay calm! #NFLKickoff is finally happening tomorrow on @snfonnbc !\nview all 282 comments\nAdd a comment... Instagram\nWhen the ‘Parks and Rec’ casting process began, the production team felt that the series couldn’t continue to be a spinoff. Rashida Jones, who was then cast in ‘Parks and Rec’, had previously played Jim’s former love interest on ‘The Office’. Spitzer confessed that the two shows couldn’t even exist in the same universe because of that minor technicality.\nWhen ‘Parks and Rec’ took on its own identity, Greg Daniels, ‘The Office’ showrunner, started looking for ideas around a show including a family. When asked about why the spinoff idea never became a reality, he said, “Then Modern Family came along”.\nabcmodernfam Verified\n1.1M followers\nView profile\nabcmodernfam Verified\n1,144 posts\n                  ·\n                  1.1M followers\nView more on Instagram\nComment Share Save\n61,584 likes\nabcmodernfam #ModernFamily\n\"That’s all a lot easier if you’ve got people who love you, helping you face whatever life throws at you.\" ❤️\nview all 903 comments\nAdd a comment... Instagram\nAnd when ‘Modern Family’ premiered, critic Alan Sepinwall wasn’t alone to tell Greene that “Modern Family shamelessly copied The Office.” Ben Silverman, the NBC chairman at the time also shared his disappointment.\n“I was really bummed about that. It annoyed me. ‘Modern Family’ is about a family the way ‘The Office’ is about an office. All I’d wanted to do was a family spin-off. I was so bummed not to be able to pull that off”.\n‘Modern Family’ did not want an ending like ‘The Office’\n‘The Office’ and ‘Modern Family’ are similar, but it seems that the latter didn’t want the series to end similarly. Fans loved ‘Modern Family’ for bringing its quirks and idiosyncrasies, and something new to the mockumentary table. When asked why the series didn’t take the same route to wrap up the story like ‘The Office’ did, ‘Modern Family’ co-creator Christopher Llyod had some words to share.\nIn an interview with “ EW ”, Lloyd explained,\n“Look, it’s a valid idea. Obviously, we started out in our pilot having that person be a character. And then the more we thought about, we thought, ‘That might take the audience out of it.’”\nabcmodernfam Verified\n1.1M followers\nView profile\nabcmodernfam Verified\n1,144 posts\n                  ·\n                  1.1M followers\nView more on Instagram\nComment Share Save\n36,915 likes\nabcmodernfam Change is never easy.\nNeed to see the #ModernFamily Finale again? 🧡 Watch anytime, on demand and on Hulu!\nview all 306 comments\nAdd a comment...

Because I think ‘The Office’ made you aware that they were actual people much more than we did. We were just using it as a technique more than a sort of an actual reality”.\nFans can agree with Lyod because a similar ending would unease the audience. The shows can be similar but a straight-up replication of the iconic ending is hardly acceptable. Which mockumentary-style series do you prefer between ‘The Office’ and ‘Modern Family’?

The characters frequently look directly at the camera as if to address the audience, and “confessional” cutaway moments in which the characters offer commentary to the viewer punctuate each scene. But unlike the setup of The Office, wherein the characters are knowingly being filmed by a documentary team for a TV show (which somehow takes 9 years to shoot), in Modern Family it’s unclear who the characters are talking to. There’s never any reference to a film or show being made about their lives, and they never address any of the documentarians by name.\nThe original concept of Modern Family included another character: a Dutch filmmaker who, 20 years earlier, had lived with the Pritchett family. Now working on a documentary about American families, he returned as an adult to film their lives. The working title for the series was “My American Family,” a title which referenced the Dutch character and made him a prominent part of the narrative.\nObviously, that’s not the route they ended up taking. Series creator Christopher Lloyd has directly stated the show has failed to explain why, in its final iteration, they kept the documentary style but jettisoned the documentarian. But he notes that breaking the fourth wall is not a new or jarring idea—Christopher Guest and Albert Brooks did it for years in films, and even Ferris Bueller stopped to address the audience—and Lloyd doesn’t really think it needs an explanation. The audience can create their own story as to why this family is being filmed and who’s doing it, which is good enough.\nOf course, that’s exactly what people are doing. A number of fan theories exist about the style’s true nature, figuring there has to be more to it than a simple stylistic decision. In Reddit’s FanTheories subreddit, one fan elaborates on his conviction that the show is adult Luke’s (Nolan Gould) documentary, based on character evidence and the fact that we never hear the documentarian asking any questions. Another fan suggests they’re all talking to a therapist, and the scenes are flashbacks re-enacting the things they tell the therapist. If that were the case, the only “real” moments of the program would be those that break the fourth wall; the rest would be memories.\nThere’s also the theory that the whole show is a follow-up show to a previous documentary about Cam (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) adopting Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons), or the one that sumises it’s all a rich family’s way of creating a photo album only the 1% could afford.\nThe show’s creators would probably be fine with any of those interpretations.\nThe device hasn’t been entirely well-received. As Jaime Weinman of Maclean’s writes, “New Jersey Star-Ledger critic Alan Sepinwall wrote that the show needs to make up its mind whether the talking heads are real or fantasy, because ‘the current approach is just distracting.’ But [series co-creator Steven] Levitan has said the documentary is ‘just our style of storytelling,’ a device to reveal characters’ feelings.”\nModern Family is, at its core, a traditional, heartfelt, and at times saccharine sitcom. Its episodes often have moral messages and even, in the final minutes, tend to lead out with rising instrumentals overlaid with Bob Saget-esque syrupy dialogue encapsulating the episode’s feel-good takeaway. The documentary format is perhaps the characteristic that most sets it apart stylistically from the waves of positive family comedies that have come before. So while a handful of viewers may find its approach awkward, it’s likely a contributing factor to what has made the show such a great success.

This is because a needle is a hard, sharp surface that stops the egg abruptly, creating a high force upon impact. The egg's shell is not designed to withstand such sudden force, leading to cracking. This aligns with the principle that hard surfaces like concrete or a needle exert large forces on the egg, whereas softer surfaces (e.g., grass, pillows) distribute the impact more gradually, reducing the risk of breaking [3].", "citations": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxgCU9uEGKs", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxgCU9uEGKs", "https://whatarethekargrandes.com/comics-characters/faq-how-can-you-drop-a-raw-egg-without-breaking-it.html", "https://www.physicsclassroom.com/PhysicsClassroom/media/interactive/Egg%20Drop/EggDrop.html", "https://edurev.in/question/1051625/How-can-you-drop-a-raw-egg-from-a-height-onto-a-co", "https://r4dn.com/how-do-you-drop-a-raw-egg-without-breaking-it/", "https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/how-can-drop-raw-egg-100-feet-from-air-without-659537", "https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/how-can-drop-raw-egg-100-feet-from-air-without-659537", "https://brainly.com/question/19336609"], "contexts": ["How can you drop a raw egg onto a concrete floor without cracking it. - YouTube\n0:00 / 0:45", "How can you drop a raw egg onto a concrete floor without cracking it. - YouTube\n0:00 / 0:45", "FAQ: How can you drop a raw egg without breaking it? - What Are The Kargrandes?\nFAQ: How can you drop a raw egg without breaking it?\n10.04.2021Frodo Baggins Comics Characters\nWhat is the best way to protect an egg in an egg drop?\nPlastic Bag Designs\nA hard shell is not the only way to protect an egg during an egg drop. Plastic bags are less of a shell, but they provide a structure to hold padding material around the egg. Add padding such as foam, bubble wrap or packing peanuts between the egg and the side of a small plastic bag.\nHow far can you drop an egg without it cracking?\nAn egg dropped from a higher height has more energy because it is going faster. That means that the cushioning system has to absorb more energy if it is going to protect the egg from breaking. If the egg is falling from 2 feet, the distance is 2 feet, so the time is. 354 seconds.\nWhat are the best materials for an egg drop?\nMaterials\nRaw egg, or other payload that needs protecting.\nContainer, like a cardboard tube, cup, box, etc.\nExternal protection materials, like balloons, rubber bands, craft sticks, straws, etc.\nInternal padding, like fabric, packing materials, paper, etc.\nPen or pencil.\nPaper.\nTape.\nScissors.\nWhat is the best shock absorber for dropping an egg?\nFill a box three times the size of the quart bag with packing peanuts, and place the plastic bag in the center. Fill the rest of the box, and seal it shut with duct tape or masking tape. The double layer of Styrofoam works as a shock absorber for the egg.\nWhy doesn’t an egg break when dropped on a pillow?\nThe egg dropped on the floor stops very quickly, which means the force on the egg is large, so it breaks. The egg dropped on the pillow slows down and stops more slowly since the pillow is squishy, therefore the force on the egg is smaller and the egg does not break.\nWe recommend reading: How can i get free psn codes?\nWill an egg break if dropped on grass?\nTo do this you must hold the egg pointed end uppermost before dropping it, and make sure you drop it on grass (ie something soft) not concrete. When the egg hits the ground the forces of the impact are distributed around the shell so it does not break.\nWill an egg break if dropped in water?\nWhat should happen is in your first two egg drops, the egg cracks. But with the egg in the salt water, the egg doesn’t crack.  The egg shell is not strong enough to withstand this force, and it breaks. In the second drop, even when the egg is in the bottle, it still hits the surface on a small area of the egg shell.\nHow much force does it take to break an egg?\nUsually, it takes a little more than 5 ½ pounds of force to crack an eggshell — much less than the weight of a human being — but the precise amount of force needed depends on the direction in which that force is applied and how much the force is distributed (or not) over the surface of the shell.\nHow do you make an egg unbreakable?\nInstructions.

Drop an egg from eye level so that it breaks. When the egg hits the ground with a given force, the ground exerts the same force back on the egg.\nWhat is the meaning of raw egg?\nRaw egg: Uncooked, unpasteurized egg. Salmonella enteritidis, a harmful bacterium, can be transmitted from infected hens directly to the interior of their eggs before the shells are formed. Even eggs with clean, uncracked shells can be infected.\nWhen hitting the ground Why would an egg break immediately?\nIt is because of the gravity, the mass of the egg, and the force exerted by the ground to the egg. Explanation: Gravity causes an object to fall to Earth when dropped. The impact made by the speed of the egg and its mass as it drop to ground, and the force exerted by the ground causes the breaking of the egg.\nWhy doesn’t an egg break when dropped on a pillow?\nThe egg dropped on the floor stops very quickly, which means the force on the egg is large, so it breaks. The egg dropped on the pillow slows down and stops more slowly since the pillow is squishy, therefore the force on the egg is smaller and the egg does not break.\nWhat do you learn from egg drop experiment?\nEgg drop projects help students explore basic concepts such as gravity, force and acceleration. In an egg drop project, the specific details and rules may vary. The general idea is to have students design a container that will allow an egg to safely fall from varying heights without breaking.\nWhat is the strongest part of an egg?\nThe egg is strongest at the top and the bottom (or at the highest point of the arch), which is why it does not break when pressure is added to both ends. The curved form of the shell also distributes pressure evenly all over the shell rather than concentrating it at any one point.\nWhat can fly but has no wings?\nAnswers To The Riddle “I Can Fly But I Have No Wings”\nThe answer for that riddle is simple!

When the egg hits the ground the forces of the impact are distributed around the shell so it does not break.\nHow fast would an unprotected egg fall?\nWhat is the speed of gravity; how fast would an unprotected egg fall? Gravity is the force that attracts mass towards the center of the earth or other large planetary body. The speed of gravity is about 9.8 meters per second. An unprotected egg would fall at about 10.93 meters per second.\nHow many eggs are left riddle?\nExplanation: The answer is six because of the use of past and present tense in the riddle. The riddle states that you have 6 eggs, which is using a present clause.\nWhat will protect an egg when dropped?\nEnclosing the egg in something that can absorb the force of impact can protect the egg from a fall. Encase the egg in any of these inside a paper or plastic bag, a sock or a stocking. If you have any bubble wrap around the house, wrapping the egg in several layers of bubble wrap should also provide a good cushion.\nHow much force does it take to break an egg vertically?\nUsually, it takes a little more than 5 ½ pounds of force to crack an eggshell — much less than the weight of a human being — but the precise amount of force needed depends on the direction in which that force is applied and how much the force is distributed (or not) over the surface of the shell.\nWhat determines if the egg breaks?\nAnswer 1: If the force of the egg striking the floor or ground is greater than the force that the egg shell can exert on itself to keep its shape, the egg will break. Some eggs are stronger than others, depending on how thick the shell is.\nIs it safe to eat raw egg?\nEating raw eggs can be potentially dangerous if they contain Salmonella. About one in 20,000 eggs does. Salmonella is a bacteria commonly found in food that causes diarrhea, fever, cramps, and vomiting.\nWhich is better boiled egg or raw egg?\nThough protein content is the same, the absorption of protein with cooked eggs is much more than the raw eggs.

Note that it is never the fall that breaks the egg, it is the impact with a hard surface that breaks it. So as long as the egg does not strike a hard surface during its fall, it will not break. In other words, we can drop the egg from a height of 101 feet or more and it will not break for the first 100 feet of the drop.\nWe can wrap the egg really nicely in protective casing to prevent it from breaking at the impact. For example, we can wrap the egg in bubble wrap and keep it in a small box containing foam. We can then wrap the entire package in a lot of bubble wrap and then drop it from any given height.

Note that it is never the fall that breaks the egg, it is the impact with a hard surface that breaks it. So as long as the egg does not strike a hard surface during its fall, it will not break. In other words, we can drop the egg from a height of 101 feet or more and it will not break for the first 100 feet of the drop.\nWe can wrap the egg really nicely in protective casing to prevent it from breaking at the impact. For example, we can wrap the egg in bubble wrap and keep it in a small box containing foam. We can then wrap the entire package in a lot of bubble wrap and then drop it from any given height.

The term \"5-0\" signifies that **50% of the skater's weight and balance are on the grinding truck (the \"5\")**, while the other truck (\"0\") is off the ground [1]. \n\nThis trick is often performed **frontside** (approaching from the front) or **backside** (approaching from the back). Key techniques include leaning back slightly, shifting weight to the tail, and keeping the grinding truck locked against the obstacle [2]. It is slightly more advanced than a 50-50 grind, where both trucks are evenly distributed across the obstacle [4]. \n\nA 5-0 is also referred to as a **tail grind** (opposite of a nose grind) [5], and variations like the **Suski Grind** combine elements of the 5-0 with other techniques [3].", "citations": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4Pvu3QarUU", "https://www.skatedeluxe.com/blog/en/trick-tips/skateboard/curb-rail/how-to-5-0/", "https://www.skateboardhere.com/suski-grind.html", "https://www.surfertoday.com/skateboarding/how-to-do-a-50-50-grind-on-a-skateboard", "https://skateboarding.fandom.com/wiki/Tail_Grind", "https://thegromlife.com/skateboarding/types-of-skateboard-grinds/"], "contexts": ["How to 5-0 Grind (FS & BS)  | Skateboard Trick Tip | skatedeluxe - YouTube\n1:26\nHow to 5-0 Grind (FS & BS)  | Skateboard Trick Tip | skatedeluxe\n37,830 views\nDec 22, 2016\n362 Dislike Share Save\nSKATEDELUXE\n72.2K subscribers\nSubscribe\nThe Frontside/Backside 5-0 Grind trick tip tutorial video shows you everything you need to know to learn the 5-0 Grind.

Like a crooked grind or an outside turned salad grind. Named for a skater name Aaron Suski.  I am not sure why.", "How to do a 50-50 grind on a skateboard\nHow to do a 50-50 grind on a skateboard\nSeptember 23, 2021 |Skateboarding\nGrinds became popular in the 1980s and remained a fundamental technique in modern street and park skateboarding. Here's how to do a 50-50 on a ledge.\nGrinding consists of sliding the skateboard's trucks along a curb, ledge, rail, box, the ramp's coping, or any other curve or angular surface in front of you.\nTherefore, anything that grinds is valid for the 50-50.\nTo perform a grind, the skater must already feel comfortable with a series of core maneuvers, including pushing the skateboard, landing the ollie, and getting into an axle stall on a curb.\nThe ollie is definitely critical. It's hard to grind a surface without jumping onto it, so the rider must previously master the sport's foundational trick.\nThe Five Steps\nGrinds can be broken down into five stages:\n1. Gaining speed;\n2. Ollieing into the object;\n3. Landing on the surface;\n4. Grinding across the obstacle with both trucks;\n5. Coming off the ledge at the end;\nThe 50-50 grind is the easiest and most basic form of grinding, and it was also the first of its kind to be performed back in the day.\nThe trick's name says it all.\nYour two left wheels will be on one side of the grind surface, and the other two right wheels will be on the other side of the obstacle.\nTo practice your first 50-50 grinds, find an efficiently waxed curb that isn't too high so that it is ready to welcome your trucks.\nThen, while standing still, ollie up and onto the object into the 50-50 position, and try to maintain your balance.\nYou can perform this exercise, for instance, on a street curb.\nAlso, try to ollie and make your board move forward in front of you in a lateral motion. Repeating this movement will help you get into the grinding object.\nYou can do the 50-50 grind either frontside or backside, but it's easier to learn it with your eyes and chest facing the direction you're going.\nFrontside 50-50 Grind Tutorial\nThe frontside 50-50 grind is the best starting point for all other grinding tricks.\nRemember to wax up the ledge to ensure the trucks slide smoothly across the surface.\nHere's how to perform a 50-50 grind:\n1. Push on your skateboard at medium speed;\n2. Adopt an ollie stance, moving the front foot up or down depending on the height of the object;\n3. Roll at a slight angle toward the object;\n4. Ollie up onto the grinding surface;\n5. Aim and lock in your trucks against the side of the wheels;\n6. Keep your front and back foot over the bolts;\n7. Maintain a low stance while sliding at a medium pace along the obstacle;\n8. Keep your weight slightly forward for maximum ride control;\n9. To come off of a 50-50 grind, just slightly press down on the tail of the board, lift the nose of the board, and slide off the end;\n10. Land cleanly and roll away;\nExtra Tips\nTry to have your wheels locked in against the edge of the obstacle to keep your board from sliding around randomly.\nAlso, if you land too far toward the other edge of the trucks, the board may fall out from underneath you.\nRails are more dangerous, especially if you're inexperienced and trying the move for the first time, so try to avoid them until everything else gets into your muscle memory.\nThe secret of a well-executed 50-50 grind lies in locking up the trucks correctly against the side of the curb so that they remain stable and balanced throughout the slide.\nIn the end, it will be the edge of the wheels that will keep your skateboard from sliding too far over on top of the obstacle.", "Tail Grind | Skateboarding Wiki | Fandom\nSkateboarding Wiki\n380\npages\nExplore\nWiki Content\nCommunity\nin: Tricks, Grind Tricks\nTail Grind\nEdit\na grind where the tail is the one grinding opposite of a Nose Grind In other words a 5-0\nCategories\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.", "Types Of Skateboard Grinds • The Grom Life\nHome\nSkateboarding\nTypes Of Skateboard Grinds\nTypes Of Skateboard Grinds\n3 minutes of reading / Skateboarding\nA skateboard grind is a trick performed by jumping onto an obstacle (such as a rail) and sliding the board using the trucks.\nFrom the crunching of the trick as it lands to the grating/grinding as it slides along the rail, it’s an epic trick that produces an equally epic sound.\nTable of Contents\nTypes of Skateboard Grind Tricks\nFrontside 50/50 Grind\nBoardslide\nBackside 50/50 Grind\nFeeble Grind\nNosegrind\nFrontside 5-0 Grind\nBackside 5-0 Grind\nSmith Grind\nCrooked Grind\nSuski Grind\nSalad Grind\nWhat are the Easiest Grinds to Learn on a Skateboard?\nWhat is it Called a 50/50?\nSummary: Types of Skateboard Grind Tricks\nTypes of Skateboard Grind Tricks\nThere are many different types of skateboard grind tricks.\nSome are simple and can be performed by beginners, others are tricky and best-reserved for pro skaters.\nFrontside 50/50 Grind\nThe frontside 50/50 or FS 50/50 is so-named because the board is half-on and half-off the rail.\nThe skater ollies onto the obstacle and grinds forward with the middle part of their deck before jumping off and landing.\nBoardslide\nA very common skateboarding trick and one of the first tricks that skateboarders use.\nIt is performed by hopping onto an obstacle and then grinding it with the middle of the board.\nBackside 50/50 Grind\nA backside 50/50 or BS 50/50 is similar to the FS, but the approach is from the back and not from the front.\nFeeble Grind\nAn advanced grind that combines a boardslide with a 50/50.\nThe skater approaches with a boardslide and then jumps to clear the rail with the front truck before grinding on the back truck.\nNosegrind\nThe nose grind is so-named because the front truck grinds the obstacle while the back truck hangs over the edge.\nFrontside 5-0 Grind\nThe skater approaches the rail from the front and grinds with the back truck as the nose is lifted in the air.\nIt’s a tricky one to master and requires very good balance.\nBackside 5-0 Grind\nSimilar to a frontside 5-0 grind, but the skater approaches from the backside and not the frontside.\nSmith Grind\nA smith grind is an advanced trick named after the skating legend Mike Smith.\nIt is performed by grinding the back truck on a rail before landing on the same truck.\nCrooked Grind\nThe crooked grind is similar to the smith grind, with the difference being that the skater grinds on the front trucks, with the tail off at an angle.\nIt’s called a crooked grind because of the “crooked” way that the board hangs off the rails.\nSuski Grind\nA grind created by Aaron Suski which combines elements of the 5-0 with the smith grind.\nIt is performed much like a 5-0 but the front truck is angled out just like a smith grind.\nSalad Grind\nThe salad grind is very similar to a suski, but with the front truck turned more like a feeble grind.\nFor this reason, it’s also known as a blunted feeble grind.\nWhat are the Easiest Grinds to Learn on a Skateboard?\nBoardslides and 50/50s are some of the easiest tricks to learn, as well as the most commonly performed tricks among novice skaters.\nWhat is it Called a 50/50?\nAs noted above, the 50/50 name comes from the fact that the board is half-on and half-off the obstacle.\nSummary: Types of Skateboard Grind Tricks\nWhether you’re grinding on curbs, rails, or lips of backyard pools, grind tricks are always good to have in your repertoire.\nThose trucks and decks were made to be ground, and truck manufacturers make sure that they can take a beating.\nSo, get out there, find a rail, wall, or curb, and start practicing!\n←\nNext Post →"]}
{"query_id": "V_0406", "generated_response": "\n\nDNA extraction involves isolating DNA from cells using a combination of physical and chemical methods. Here's a simplified overview based on common procedures:\n\n1. **Cell Lysis**: Cells are broken open (e.g., by blending, grinding, or using detergents like SDS) to release DNA. This step is often followed by adding proteinase K to degrade proteins bound to DNA [1][2][4].  \n2. **Protein and Lipid Removal**: Detergents (e.g., liquid dish soap) and salt solutions are used to remove lipids and proteins, while enzymes like RNase degrade RNA [1][4].  \n3. **DNA Precipitation**: Alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol) is added to the solution. DNA, being insoluble in alcohol, precipitates out as a white stringy mass [2][3][4].  \n4. **Purification**: The DNA is collected by centrifugation, washed, and dissolved in a buffer (e.g., TE buffer) for further use [1][3][4].  \n\nFor specific samples (e.g., cheek cells, plants, or forensic materials), specialized protocols may apply. For example, a common lab method uses a buccal swab, lysis buffer, centrifugation, and alcohol precipitation [3]. Commercial kits (e.g., Chelex or spin-column methods) also streamline the process [4].  \n\nThe choice of method depends on the sample type, desired DNA quality, and lab equipment.

This procedure involves chemical hydrolysis of DNA: when heated (e.g.\n≥95 °C) in acid, the reaction requires a deoxyribose sugar and therefore\nis specific for DNA. Under these conditions, the 2-deoxyribose is converted to\nw-hydroxylevulinyl aldehyde, which reacts with the compound, diphenylamine, to\nproduce a blue-colored compound. DNA concentration can be determined measuring\nthe intensity of absorbance of the solution at the 600 nm with a spectrophotometerand comparing to a standard curve of known DNA concentrations.\nMeasuring the intensity of absorbance of the DNA solution at\nwavelengths 260 nm and 280 nm is used\nas a measure of DNA purity. DNA absorbs UV light at 260 and 280\nnanometres, and aromatic proteins absorb UV light at 280 nm; a pure sample\nof DNA has a ratio of 1.8 at 260/280 and is relatively free from protein\ncontamination. A DNA preparation that is contaminated with protein will have a\n260/280 ratio lower than 1.8.\nDNA can be quantified by cutting the DNA with a restriction enzyme, running it on an agarose gel, staining with ethidium\nbromide or a different stain and comparing the intensity of the DNA\nwith a DNA marker of known concentration.\nUsing the Southern blottechnique, this quantified DNA can be isolated and examined further using PCR and RFLP analysis. These\nprocedures allow differentiation of the repeated sequences within the genome.\nIt is these techniques which forensic scientists use for comparison, identification, and\nanalysis.\nالمشاركات الشائعة من هذه المدونة\nLifestyles in algeria\nيناير 02, 2016\nLifestyles in algeria   Provided :   To talk about heritage and ancient ways of living in the present day, it became something that is not mentioned, because of the specter of Altknuluja, and civilization that has touched all aspects of our daily lives, at all levels, especially where the cultural level, I sensed in the traditional Our punishment has been transformed into a mere Textile placed in museums, and turning our food the old to the modern health only, and invaded and traditional entertainment, internet technology, but all this does not mean that touched on to talk about the old ways of Algerians live and how they are now, and why not, if we were to give a simplified idea of how the future will, All of this we will address in our research that this simplified I hope to be at the required level .

Some bacteria use RNA for their genetic code, but any other living organism will work as a DNA source for this project. It's easy to extract and isolate DNA, which you can then use for further experimentation.\nDNA Extraction Materials\nWhile you can use any DNA source, some work especially well. Peas, such as dried split green peas, are an excellent choice. Spinach leaves, strawberries, chicken liver, and bananas are other options. Don't use DNA from living people or pets, as a simple matter of ethics. Be certain your sample actually contains a lot of DNA. Old bones or teeth or shells consist mainly of minerals and only traces of genetic material.\n100 ml (1/2 cup) of a DNA source\n1 ml (⅛ teaspoon) table salt, NaCl\n200 ml (1 cup) cold water\nEnzymes to denature protein (e.g., meat tenderizer, fresh pineapple juice, or contact lens cleaning solution)\n30 ml (2 tablespoons) liquid dishwashing detergent\n70-90% rubbing alcohol or other isopropyl or ethyl alcohol\nBlender\nStrainer\nCup or bowl\nTest tubes\nStraws or wooden skewers\nPerform the DNA Extraction\nBlend together 100 ml of DNA source, 1 ml of salt, and 200 ml of cold water. This takes about 15 seconds on high setting. You are aiming for a homogeneous soupy mixture. The blender breaks apart the cells, releasing the DNA that is stored inside.\nPour the liquid through a strainer into another container. Your goal is to remove the large solid particles. Keep the liquid; discard the solids.\nAdd 30 ml liquid detergent to the liquid. Stir or swirl the liquid to mix it. Allow this solution to react for 5-10 minutes before proceeding to the next step.\nAdd a small pinch of meat tenderizer or a squirt of pineapple juice or contact lens cleaner solution to each vial or tube. Swirl the contents gently to incorporate the enzyme. Harsh stirring will break the DNA and make it harder to see in the container.\nTilt each tube and pour alcohol down the side of each glass or plastic to form a floating layer on top of the liquid. Alcohol is less dense than water, so it will float on the liquid, but you don't want to pour it into the tubes because then it will mix. If you examine the interface between the alcohol and each sample, you should see a white stringy mass. This is the DNA!\nUse a wooden skewer or a straw to capture and collect the DNA from each tube. You can examine the DNA using a microscope or magnifying glass or place it in a small container of alcohol to save it.\nHow It Works\nThe first step is to choose a source that contains a lot of DNA. Although you can use DNA from anywhere, sources high in DNA will yield more product at the end. The human genome is diploid, meaning it contains two copies of each DNA molecule. Many plants contain multiple copies of their genetic material. For example, strawberries are octoploid and contain 8 copies of each chromosome.\nBlending the specimen breaks apart the cells so you can separate the DNA from other molecules. Salt and detergent act to strip away proteins normally bound to DNA. The detergent also separates the lipids (fats) from the sample. The enzymes are used to cut the DNA. Why would you want to cut it? The DNA is folded and wrapped around proteins, so it needs to be freed before it can be isolated.\nAfter you have completed these steps, the DNA is separated from other cell constituents, but you still need to get it out of solution. This is where the alcohol comes into play. The other molecules in the sample will dissolve in alcohol, but DNA does not. When you pour alcohol (the colder the better) onto the solution, the DNA molecule precipitates so that you can collect it.\nSources\nElkins, K.M. (2013). \"DNA Extraction\".

With a pure sample of DNA you can test a  newborn for a genetic disease, body identification, or analyse forensic evidences.\nDNA EXTRACTION\nDNA extraction is a process of purification of DNA from sample using a combination of physical and chemical methods. The first isolation of DNA was done in 1869 by Friedrich Miescher. Currently, it is a routine procedure in molecular biology or forensic science. DNA extraction is typically the first step in a longer laboratory process. It is an important part of that process because the DNA first needs to be purified away form proteins and other cellular contaminants. DNA is located in cells. Inside almost every cells in our bodies is a nucleus, and inside each nucleus is about two meters of DNA.\nThere are 4 steps in a process to purify DNA from a cheek swab:\n1. Collect cheek cells.\n2. Burst cells open to release DNA.\n3. Separate DNA from proteins and debris.\n4. Isolate concentrated DNA.\nMaterials:\n- Warm water bath\n- Micro-centrifuge\n- Buccal swap\n- Micropippetors\n- Sample tubes\n- Lysis solution\n- Concentrated salt solution\n- Resuspension buffer\n- Ethanol\n- Isopropyl alcohol\nProcess:\n1. Collect cheek cells:\nUse the buccal swab to collect a sample (cheek cells) inside the subject's mouth\nNext, place the swab into an Eppendorf tube. It is covered with hundred of tiny cheek cells. Inside each cheek cell is a nucleus, and inside the nucleus is the DNA.\n2. Burst cells open to release DNA:\nThe end of the swab must be cut off so it will be able to close the tube. Using the micropippetor, add some lysis solution to the tube.\nPlace the tube into the warm water bath.\nThe lysis solution contains 2 important ingredients: detergent and an enzyme called proteinase K. The detergent disrupts the cell membrane and nuclear envelope, causing the cells to burst open and release their DNA. The proteinase K cuts apart the histones to free the DNA.\n3.

For the chemical method, there are many different kits used for extraction, and selecting the correct one will save time on kit optimization and extraction procedures. PCR sensitivity detection is considered to show the variation between the commercial kits.

The most commonly used procedures are:\nEthanol precipitation usually by ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol. Since DNA is insoluble in these alcohols, it will aggregate together, giving a pellet upon centrifugation. Precipitation of DNA is improved by increasing of ionic strength, usually by adding sodium acetate.\nPhenol–chloroform extraction in which phenol denatures proteins in the sample. After centrifugation of the sample, denatured proteins stay in the organic phase while the aqueous phase containing nucleic acid is mixed with chloroform to remove phenol residues from the solution.\nMinicolumn purification that relies on the fact that the nucleic acids may bind (adsorption) to the solid phase (silica or other) depending on the pH and the salt concentration of the buffer.\nCellular and histone proteins bound to the DNA can be removed either by adding a protease or by having precipitated the proteins with sodium or ammonium acetate, or extracted them with a phenol-chloroform mixture prior to the DNA-precipitation.\nAfter isolation, the DNA is dissolved in a slightly alkaline buffer, usually in a TE buffer, or in ultra-pure water.\nMethod selection\nSome of the most common DNA extraction methods include organic extraction, Chelex extraction, and solid phase extraction.[3] These methods consistently yield isolated DNA, but they differ in both the quality and the quantity of DNA yielded. When selecting a DNA extraction method, there are multiple factors to consider, including cost, time, safety, and risk of contamination.\nOrganic extraction involves the addition of and incubation in multiple different chemical solutions; [3] including a lysis step, a phenol chloroform extraction, an ethanol precipitation, and washing steps. Organic extraction is often used in laboratories because it is cheap, and it yields large quantities of pure DNA. Though it is easy, there are many steps involved, and it takes longer than other methods. It also involves the unfavorable use of the toxic chemicals phenol and chloroform, and there is an increased risk of contamination due to transferring the DNA between multiple tubes. [4] Several protocols based on organic extraction of DNA were effectively developed decades ago, [5] though improved and more practical versions of these protocols have also been developed and published in the last years. [6]\nChelex extraction method involves adding the Chelex resin to the sample, boiling the solution, then vortexing and centrifuging it. The cellular materials bind to the Chelex beads, while the DNA is available in the supernatant.[4] The Chelex method is much faster and simpler than organic extraction, and it only requires one tube, which decreases the risk of DNA contamination. Unfortunately, Chelex extraction does not yield as much quantity and the DNA yielded is single-stranded, which means it can only be used for PCR -based analyses and not for RFLP.[4]\nSolid phase extraction such as using a spin-column based extraction method takes advantage of the fact that DNA binds to silica. The sample containing DNA is added to a column containing a silica gel or silica beads and chaotropic salts. The chaotropic salts disrupt the hydrogen bonding between strands and facilitate binding of the DNA to silica by causing the nucleic acids to become hydrophobic. This exposes the phosphate residues so they are available for adsorption. [7] The DNA binds to the silica, while the rest of the solution is washed out using ethanol to remove chaotropic salts and other unnecessary constituents. [3] The DNA can then be rehydrated with aqueous low salt solutions allowing for elution of the DNA from the beads.\nThis method yields high-quality, largely double-stranded DNA which can be used for both PCR and RFLP analysis. This procedure can be automated [4] and has a high throughput, although lower than the phenol-chloroform method. This is a one-step method i.e the entire procedure is completed in one tube. This lowers the risk of contamination making it very useful for forensic extraction of DNA. Multiple solid phase extraction commercial kits are manufactured and marketed by different companies; the only problem is that they are more expensive than organic extraction or Chelex extraction.\nThere are commercially available DNA extraction kits for variety of biological samples, one such kit is the Taqgen® Blood Genomic DNA Kit, which is suitable for Genomic DNA Extraction from whole Blood, body fluids, buccal swabs, buffy coat and cultured cells. It is a spin column based kit, provide an easy, rapid and efficient purification of high quality genomic DNA. The purified DNA can be used directly in a variety of downstream applications, including PCR, Real-time PCR, southern blotting and restriction enzyme digestion. The kit eliminates the need for expensive resin, toxic phenol-chloroform extractions, or time-consuming alcohol precipitation. The standard procedure takes less than 20 minutes following cell lysis and yield purified DNA greater than 30 Kb in size.\nSpecial types\nSpecific techniques must be chosen for isolation of DNA from some samples. Typical samples with complicated DNA isolation are:\narchaeological samples containing partially degraded DNA, see ancient DNA [8]\nsamples containing inhibitors of subsequent analysis procedures, most notably inhibitors of PCR, such as humic acid from soil, indigo and other fabric dyes or haemoglobin in blood\nsamples from microorganisms with thick cellular wall, for example yeast\nsamples containing mixed DNA from multiple sources\nExtrachromosomal DNA is generally easy to isolate, especially plasmids may be easily isolated by cell lysis followed by precipitation of proteins, which traps chromosomal DNA in insoluble fraction and after centrifugation, plasmid DNA can be purified from soluble fraction.\nA Hirt DNA Extraction is an isolation of all extrachromosomal DNA in a mammalian cell. The Hirt extraction process gets rid of the high molecular weight nuclear DNA, leaving only low molecular weight mitochondrial DNA and any viral episomes present in the cell.\nDetection of DNA\nMain article: Quantification of nucleic acids\nA diphenylamine (DPA) indicator will confirm the presence of DNA. This procedure involves chemical hydrolysis of DNA: when heated (e.g. ≥95 °C) in acid, the reaction requires a deoxyribose sugar and therefore is specific for DNA. Under these conditions, the 2-deoxyribose is converted to w-hydroxylevulinyl aldehyde, which reacts with the compound, diphenylamine, to produce a blue-colored compound. DNA concentration can be determined measuring the intensity of absorbance of the solution at the 600 nm with a spectrophotometer and comparing to a standard curve of known DNA concentrations.\nMeasuring the intensity of absorbance of the DNA solution at wavelengths 260 nm and 280 nm is used as a measure of DNA purity. DNA can be quantified by cutting the DNA with a restriction enzyme, running it on an agarose gel, staining with ethidium bromide (EtBr) or a different stain and comparing the intensity of the DNA with a DNA marker of known concentration.\nUsing the Southern blot technique, this quantified DNA can be isolated and examined further using PCR and RFLP analysis. These procedures allow differentiation of the repeated sequences within the genome. It is these techniques which forensic scientists use for comparison, identification, and analysis.\nHigh-molecular-weight DNA extraction method\nIn this method, plant nuclei are isolated by physically grinding tissues and reconstituting the intact nuclei in a unique Nuclear Isolation Buffer (NIB). The plastid DNAs are released from organelles and eliminated with an osmotic buffer by washing and centrifugation. The purified nuclei are then lysed and further cleaned by organic extraction, and the genomic DNA is precipitated with a high concentration of CTAB. The highly pure, high molecular weight gDNA is extracted from the nuclei, dissolved in a high pH buffer, allowing for stable long-term storage.

From the prehistoric men and women who chowed lumps of tree resin for\n    enjoyment, Ancient Greeks who used tree resin to clean their teeth and freshen their breath, Maya Indians who used gummed chicle, and Europeans and\n    American settlers who used hardened tree sap and beeswax. Sadly, even though use of chewing gum can undoubtedly have many positive effects, it can also\n    endanger us. Here are some of the most common chewing gum side effects and disadvantages:\nTooth Decay\nSugared gums can with heavy use cause tooth decay, gum disease and cavities. This happens because sugar coats the teeth, and can slowly cause damaging of\n    tooth enamel if they are not immediately brushed. To reduce harmful effects of sugared gums, seek out gum brands that use smaller quantities of sugar.\nArtificial Sweetener Allergies\nAlmost all popular sugar brands use artificial sweeteners to make their products longer lasing, sweeter or to achieve special kind of taste. Some of those\n    artificial sweeteners can cause allergic reaction, especially Aspartame and Sorbitol. Others can cause irritation or headaches.\nJaw Stress\nEven though many gum manufacturers claim that their products can be used all the time and on any occasion, detailed studies show that habitual use of\n    chewing gums may cause continuous stress on your jaws. If not regulated, this stress can lead to the condition called d Temporomandibular Joint Disorder\n    (TJD), which is manifested with strong facial pain and great discomfort in the back of the neck.\nStomach Issues\nContinuous chewing of gum can lead to the increased levels of stress to your stomach and intestines. After meals your stomach mush receive period of\n    resting time for him to digest food, but chewing and continuous swallowing of saliva interferes with that rest. Stomach issues that can appear in those\n    situations are irritation, aches, and aggravated gastritis. In some cases, you can even develop gastric ulcer!\nSocial distraction\nIn many modern cultures, people have accepted that chewing a gum in some social environments (public areas, school, workplace, etc.) is distracting and\n    irritating. Please consider what social effects your chewing gum will cause in the people around you.\nMasseter problems\nFrequent chewing of gum can lead to masseter problems that are result of your constant grinding of teeth at night. If you are suffering from JMJ\n    dysfunction, you must consider totally abandoning gums.\nKidney problems\nIf the cavities in your teeth are filled with mercury fillings, frequent chewing of gun may cause their dislodging and releasing of this dangerous material\n    in your metabolism. The most common target of mercury is blood, urinary tract, nerves and brain.\nIrregular development of facial muscles\nExtensive chewing of gum in puberty may lead to the stimulation of jawbone and facial muscles and creation of larger face.", "Effects of Chewing Gum on Your Teeth - Oral-B\nHome\nLearn\nEffects of Chewing Gum on Your Teeth\nEFFECTS OF CHEWING GUM ON YOUR TEETH\nIs Chewing Gum Good for Your Teeth?\nIs Sugar Free Gum Bad for Your Teeth?\nIs Chewing Gum Good for Your Teeth?\nThe answer is yes, if it is the right kind. Chewing gum can help prevent tooth decay, as long as you choose a sugarless gum. Chewing gum causes your mouth to produce more saliva, which helps neutralize and rinse away some of the acid that forms in your mouth when you break down food. So, if you chew gum after a meal, you may be helping to protect your teeth and promote oral health.\nAlso, the minerals generated by the extra saliva can even help strengthen your tooth enamel, which also reduces your risk of a dental cavity .\nPopular For Healthy Gums\n549\nIs Sugar Free Gum Bad for Your Teeth?\nParents can share this oral care hint with children and teens, who often chew gum. Just be sure that they choose sugarless gum, not a sugary bubble gum, which can have the opposite effect and contribute to the buildup of plaque on teeth. The American Dental Association recommends sugarless gum, and some types of sugarless gum have the American Dental Association seal of approval on their packaging. So, if you are uncertain about which gum is best for promoting oral health, look for that seal when you purchase gum for yourself or your family members.\nBut remember (and remind children) that gum-chewing, even sugarless gum, is not a substitute for a regular oral care routine of twice-daily tooth brushing and daily proper flossing with quality dental care products.", "What will happen to chewed and un chewed gum in different te by Catie Markey\nPresent\nUp next\nUser Experience Workshop\nPrezi Team\nWhat will happen to chewed and un chewed gum in different te\n111\nLearn about Prezi\nCM\nCatie Markey\nFri Apr 25 2014\nOutline\n13 frames\nReader view\nBubblegum Bubblegum in a Dish\nProcedure\nCold Water\nTrident after, inside of un-chewed was dry medium hard\nTrident after, chewed was medium soft’\nOrbit after inside of un-chewed wet on the inside, medium hard\nOrbit after chewed was soft\nStride after, inside of un-chewed was moist, medium\nStride after, chewed was very soft\nIce water\nTrident chewed medium hard (SANK)\nTrident un-chewed inside, wet hard\nOrbit un-chewed dry inside medium\nOrbit chewed medium soft\nStride un-chewed dry inside soft\nStride chewed medium hard\nFreezer\nStride – un-chewed, dry inside, soft\nStride – chewed, medium hard, stuck to plate\nOrbit – un-chewed, moist in inside\nOrbit – chewed, soft, didn’t stick to plate.\nTrident – un-chewed, dry inside, hard\nTrident – chewed, stuck to plate, hard\nBlow dryer\nTrident – chewed, sticky, gooey and hot and soft\nTrident – un-chewed, soft, hot and sticky,\nStride- chewed, VERY STICKY, VERY GOOEY, hot , VERY SOFT\nStride- un-chewed, sticky, hot\nOrbit- chewed, hot gooey and sticky\nOrbit – un-chewed is very hot and sticky\nTrident – chewed, soupy and burned\nTrident, un-chewed, soupy\nStride- chewed, soupy\nStride – un-chewed, soupy and burned\nOrbit – chewed and un-chewed, soupy\nToaster Oven\nOrbit- hot and gooey\nStride- sticky and hot\nTrident- soft and sticky\nI\n1.

It has been in practice for centuries and is an essential part of religious and social practices in these areas. It is used in Indian Ayurved as well as Chinese traditional medicines to treat certain ailments. Used in controlled doses in these traditional medicines, betel nut or Areca nut provides certain health benefits. However what makes betel nut chewing harmful is its random and regular use as a mouth freshner, energy booster or just as a socially learned habit.\nBetel nut is consumed in dried, processed and sweetened forms. It is also a part of the betel quid where its slices are wrapped in betel leaf with slaked lime, cardamom and other flavorings. People often add tobacco in the betel quid which packs a double punch. What makes betel nut chewing popular is its stimulant effect along with a sense of well being and perceived increase in stamina.\nEffect on Oral Cavity\nThere is rising concern regarding its harmful effects on the body and specifically on oral health. Chewing of betel nut encourages salivation and removes bad breath in the short term. However regular and long term use causes gum and membrane irritation which harden inner cheeks gradually. The membrane irritation and the changes that betel nut alkaloids cause in soft tissues of the mouth have been implicated in the development of oral submucous fibrosis.\nAs the membranes become stiff the person is unable to open his mouth properly and also finds eating difficult. Sores and lesions are also observed on the membranes of the oral cavity, especially where the betel quid rests. These lesions and sores take time to heal or in the case of regular chewers may form repeatedly.\nEffect on Teeth\nCombined with tobacco or taken as a part of betel quid makes betel nut even more unsafe for dental health. The use of catechu powder gives the betel quid a characteristic red color. Catechu powder and tobacco combined with betel nut stains tooth enamel, gums and membranes permanently. These red to brown stains look very unsightly and cannot be removed.\nIt has been observed that people who indulge in betel nut chewing have a lower rate of tooth cavities. It is speculated that it is the betel nut staining that protects against dental caries as it forms a film over enamel, preventing the process of demineralization.\nHowever, this benefit is offset by the increased chewing load on the teeth. Betel nut chewing causes tooth fractures which in turn leads to a host of dental issues. Being hard, it also leads to abrasion of the chewing surfaces of the back teeth (premolars and molars) and also shortens canines and incisors. This abrasion exposes the inner dentine eventually causing sensitivity to hot and cold. Worn down teeth are commonly seen in heavy betel nut chewers. For those who are regular chewers, the chances of root fractures are also considerably increased. This in turn increases the possibility of gingivitis and periodontal disease.", "Effects of Chewing Gums on Oral Health - Micris Dental Clinic\nDisturbing Effects of Chewing Gums on Oral Health\nMicris - Mar 4, 2020\nTowards the end of the Stone Age, when the teeth were used as tools, a man by the side of Li River in western Finland chewed a piece of birch bark tar, and possibly discarded it somewhere in his settlement. 5000 years later it was recovered with his well-defined tooth imprint upon it. So, our craze for chewing gums is as old as the hills. Ancient Greeks’ chewing gum was called “mastiche.’’ It was the sap of a tree called mastic. People of Mayan civilization used to chew chicle, the sap of the sapodilla tree. Chewing gums were natural back then, and as time passed, they turned synthetic. But why have we been chewing on the gums for so long? Studies suggest that chewing gums help us to deal with stress and anxiety. For this reason, chewing gum was an emergency ration during World War 2. Chewing gums also give the feeling of freshness to the mouth. But as we know, anything we put into our mouth is having not just a psychological effect. They affect our oral as well as overall health. Let’s check some adverse effects of chewing gums on our oral health.\nChewing Gums Can Cause Tooth Damage\nSugar-containing chewing gums are usually sweetened by a disaccharide called sucrose. Disaccharide or double sugar is a type of carbohydrate. Some bacteria present in your mouth including Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus can metabolize the sucrose. When you chew the sugar-containing gums, it coats the teeth with sucrose and the bacteria work on this coating to produce acids that destroy the enamel. This leads to cavities.\nChewing Gums May Trigger Temporomandibular Disorder in Your Jaw\nTemporomandibular joints (TMJ) are the two joints on either side of your jaw. They connect the jaw to the skull. Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is the condition in which you feel pain and discomfort in the temporomandibular joints and the associated muscles. TMD is caused by several reasons ranging from teeth grinding to joint problems in the jaw like arthritis. If you are a serial chewer of the gums, you need to worry about TMD. Studies suggest that the long spells of gum chewing may increase the prevalence of TMD. TMD manifests several symptoms including headache, toothache, earache and neck pain. Excessive gum chewing, especially on one side of the mouth, may lead to the overuse of jaw muscles and joints on that side. This will cause pain in the jaw. If the pain and discomfort in the jaw persist even after you stop the gum-chewing habit, consult your dentist to rule out TMD.\n“Too much of anything is bad for everything’’ is what makes the chewing gum a villain. The right type of chewing gum, when used moderately is actually having some oral health benefits. The American Dental Association recommends the use of sugar-free chewing gums having an “ADA Seal.” ADA seal ensures that the product has been evaluated for safety and efficacy. Chewing the sugar-free gums after the meals is beneficial because it helps in increasing the flow of saliva to the mouth. This salivary flow helps to prevent tooth decay. Sugar-free chewing gums also improve the symptoms of dry mouth. Though the safe and moderate use of chewing gums is beneficial for your mouth, you shouldn’t use them exclusively for cleaning the teeth. ADA states that gum chewing is not a substitute for brushing or flossing. It is recommended that you should brush twice a day using a fluoride toothpaste and floss once a day to keep your teeth clean. Also, get them deep-cleaned by your hygienist at least twice a year. Proper maintenance of oral health is essential for a good-quality life.\nPrevious Next", "Effects of Chewing Gums on Oral Health - Micris Dental Clinic\nDisturbing Effects of Chewing Gums on Oral Health\nMicris - Mar 4, 2020\nTowards the end of the Stone Age, when the teeth were used as tools, a man by the side of Li River in western Finland chewed a piece of birch bark tar, and possibly discarded it somewhere in his settlement. 5000 years later it was recovered with his well-defined tooth imprint upon it.

Proper maintenance of oral health is essential for a good-quality life.\nPrevious Next", "TOP 9 QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT CHEWING GUM\nBlog\nTOP 9 QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT CHEWING GUM\nAugust 25, 2021\n1.Is chewing gum good for your oral health?\nYes, chewing sugar-free gum can be beneficial for oral health.

Think about the following things before you slide the next piece of gum to your children\nMigraines\nA recent study found that chewing gum daily was linked to headaches in a group of teens. The test subjects stopped chewing gum for one month, and for ⅔ of them, their headaches went away, and about ½ of the remaining subjects had significant reductions in their headache amount and severity. When they began chewing gum again, their headaches came back.\nIncrease Junk Food\nMany people chew gum in order to avoid snacking on unhealthy foods. However, the opposite effect actually occurs. While people who chew gum do have a reduced motivation to eat, the things they do eat tend to be less healthy. Gum chewers are more likely to reach for potato chips and candy after they finish chewing than fruits and vegetables (part of that is due to the minty flavor of the gum – it makes fruits and vegetables taste bitter).\nIncrease Chances of TMJ\nChewing gum puts an excessive amount of stress on your jaw that can lead to TMJ. TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder) is a painful condition that comes from overuse of certain muscles in your jaw. It can lead to headaches, neck pain, earaches, and other problems.\nTooth Damage\nGum that has sugar in it allows the sugar to coat your teeth while you chew. That can lead to plaque buildup and tooth decay. Even sugar free gum can be dangerous for your teeth, as they can contain artificial flavors and preservatives that can cause your teeth to slowly dissolve. If you have mercury fillings, chewing gum can allow the neurotoxin to release into your body.\nStomach Problems\nChewing gum can lead to stress in your stomach and intestines. It can worsen symptoms of IBS. Your stomach needs time to rest from food in order to digest, but if you consistently chew gum, you swallow an excessive amount of spit, not allowing your body to properly digest. The chewing also signals to your body that you are about to swallow food, so the enzymes and acids that your body uses to digest are activated, causing all sorts of problems. Your body can become bloated, start to over-produce stomach acid, and lessen your ability to digest food when you actually do eat. The artificial sweeteners in the gum can also cause diarrhea and gastrointestinal problems.\nMAKE AN APPOINTMENT\nCONTACT US TODAY!\n602-730-6481\nOur Services\nDental Crowns\nDental Exams and Cleanings\nDental Fillings\nOrthodontic Space Maintainers\nPediatric Dentistry"]}
