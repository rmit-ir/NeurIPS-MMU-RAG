{"query":"tell me the difference between \"the office\" and \"modern family\" about the actors looking at the camera","reference":"The main difference between The Office and Modern Family in how actors look at the camera lies in their use of the mockumentary format. \n\nThe Office uses a true mockumentary style. Characters frequently look directly at the camera, break the fourth wall, and even interact with the unseen documentary crew. These \"glances\" or reactions are often used for humor or to reveal inner thoughts. The show also includes talking-head interviews where characters address the camera directly.\n\nModern Family imitates the mockumentary style with talking-head interviews, but the characters rarely look at or acknowledge the camera during scenes. The interviews are staged like confessions, but the camera crew is never acknowledged in the narrative world.","iid":"V_0507"}
