{"query_id": "V_0019", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response correctly defines a 5\u20110 grind, explains its mechanics (back truck only, front truck airborne, 50% weight distribution), notes frontside/backside variations, and mentions related tricks such as tail grind and Suski grind. All of these details are directly supported by the retrieved documents (Doc\u202f1, Doc\u202f2, Doc\u202f3, Doc\u202f5). The answer is fully relevant to the implied question about what a 5\u20110 grind is, contains no irrelevant content, and is fully grounded in the source material."}
{"query_id": "V_0478", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response directly answers the implied question about tying shoelaces, providing clear, step\u2011by\u2011step instructions for the bunny ears method, the standard method, and a one\u2011handed alternative. All content is relevant and there is no extraneous or misleading information. The steps described are fully supported by the retrieved documents: Document\u202f1 details the bunny ears method, Document\u202f5 covers the standard method, and Document\u202f2 explains the one\u2011handed knot. Therefore the answer is both relevant and fully faithful to the source material."}
{"query_id": "V_0406", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response directly addresses the likely question about how to extract DNA, outlining the key steps (lysis, protein/lipid removal, precipitation, purification) and mentioning common variations such as commercial kits and minicolumn purification. All of these elements are present in the retrieved documents (Documents 1, 2, 3, and 4), and the response cites the appropriate sources. No irrelevant or unsupported claims are made. Therefore the answer is fully relevant and fully grounded in the provided context."}
{"query_id": "V_0522", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response accurately answers the question by outlining a step\u2011by\u2011step method for removing people using Content\u2011Aware Fill, and also mentions other relevant tools (Spot Healing Brush, Patch Tool, Clone Stamp). It contains no irrelevant or misleading content, so it meets the highest relevance criteria. All key points in the answer are supported by the retrieved documents: duplicate layer, pen tool selection, content\u2011aware fill, and alternative tools are all described in the documents. Therefore the answer is fully faithful to the source material."}
{"query_id": "V_0507", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response directly addresses the question about how *The Office* and *Modern Family* differ in their use of camera interactions. It accurately states that *The Office* has an in\u2011universe documentary crew and that the camera is part of the narrative, while *Modern Family* lacks an explicit in\u2011universe explanation and treats the camera as a stylistic device. The content is focused and contains no irrelevant material, so the relevance score is 2. All key claims are supported by the retrieved documents: Document\u202f1 confirms the documentary crew in *The Office* and the lack of one in *Modern Family*; Documents\u202f4 and\u202f5 elaborate on the unclear target of the camera in *Modern Family*. Therefore the faithfulness score is 1."}
{"query_id": "V_0874", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response directly addresses the question of how to peel an apple, providing a comprehensive list of methods that are all supported by the retrieved documents. It includes vegetable peeler, swivel peeler, potato peeler, Y\u2011shaped peeler, knife method, and coring techniques, all of which are mentioned in the sources. While the answer is more detailed than the gold reference, it remains relevant and does not contain unrelated content. All answer parts are grounded in the retrieved passages, so the faithfulness score is full support."}
{"query_id": "V_0783", "relevance_score": -1, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response explicitly states that none of the retrieved documents contain information about chewing the pointed part of an almond or its stubble, and therefore it refuses to answer the question. This does not provide the answer that the user is seeking, so the relevance is negative. However, the statement that the documents do not cover the topic is accurate and fully supported by the retrieved sources, so the faithfulness score is positive."}
{"query_id": "V_0005", "relevance_score": -1, "faithfulness_score": 0, "evaluation_notes": "The response claims that all six Starship engines are used during launch to ensure control and stability. This directly contradicts the question (and the gold reference answer) which states that not all engines are lit during launch due to redundancy and safety considerations. Therefore the answer does not address the user\u2019s question and is irrelevant. Regarding faithfulness, the claim that all engines must fire during ascent is supported by Document\u202f1, which discusses the need for all engines for control authority. However, the response ignores the nuance that some engines may be off during certain phases of the launch sequence. Because the answer is not fully grounded in the retrieved documents for the specific question asked, it receives a partial support score of 0."}
{"query_id": "V_0405", "relevance_score": 1, "faithfulness_score": 0, "evaluation_notes": "The response directly addresses the question of what happens when a raw egg is dropped onto a needle, explaining that the egg would likely crack or break due to the hard, sharp surface. This is a relevant and useful answer, though the gold reference indicates that a needle could pierce the shell without cracking it, so the response is not fully accurate. The answer does not contain irrelevant content, so it scores a 1 on relevance. Regarding faithfulness, the explanation is not explicitly supported by the retrieved documents (none of the documents discuss a needle specifically), so the answer has only partial support from the context. Therefore, it receives a faithfulness score of 0."}
