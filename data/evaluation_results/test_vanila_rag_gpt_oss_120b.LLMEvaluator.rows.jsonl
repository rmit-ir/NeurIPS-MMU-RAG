{"query_id": "V_0406", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response provides a clear, step\u2011by\u2011step description of DNA extraction that matches the expected answer (cell lysis with detergent/salt, removal of proteins/RNA, alcohol precipitation of DNA, and purification). All major points are covered and align with the gold reference answer. The information is directly supported by the retrieved documents, which describe cell disruption, use of detergents and salts, proteinase/RNase treatment, ethanol/isopropanol precipitation, and purification steps. No unsupported or irrelevant content is present."}
{"query_id": "V_0507", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response directly answers the implied question about how The Office and Modern Family differ in the way actors look at the camera, explaining the in\u2011universe documentary premise of The Office versus the purely stylistic, unexplained approach of Modern Family. This matches the gold reference and contains no irrelevant material, earning a relevance score of 2. All key points are supported by the retrieved documents: the Reddit thread (Doc\u202f1) and the articles from The Take (Docs\u202f4/5) describe The Office\u2019s explicit documentary crew and Modern Family\u2019s lack of an in\u2011universe explanation, including the original Dutch filmmaker concept. Therefore the answer is fully grounded in the provided sources, giving a faithfulness score of 1."}
{"query_id": "V_0478", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response provides a clear, correct answer to how to tie shoelaces, covering the bunny\u2011ears method, the standard method, and a one\u2011handed variant. All steps are consistent with the gold reference and with the retrieved documents (e.g., Document\u202f1 describes the X and bunny\u2011ears steps, Document\u202f5/8 describe the standard method, and Document\u202f2 describes the one\u2011handed knot). No irrelevant material is introduced, and every claim is grounded in the provided sources."}
{"query_id": "V_0522", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response correctly answers the implied question about removing unwanted people in Photoshop, providing a clear step\u2011by\u2011step method (duplicate layer, pen\u2011tool selection, Content\u2011Aware Fill) and mentioning alternative tools (Spot Healing, Patch, Clone Stamp). All of these steps and tool suggestions are directly supported by the retrieved documents (e.g., Document\u202f4 describes the same pen\u2011tool + Content\u2011Aware Fill workflow; Documents\u202f1,\u202f3 describe Clone Stamp, Spot Healing, Patch, and Content\u2011Aware Fill). No irrelevant information is added. Therefore the answer is fully relevant and fully grounded in the provided sources."}
{"query_id": "V_0019", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response accurately describes what a 5\u20110 grind is, including the use of the back truck, the front truck being in the air, weight distribution, frontside/backside approaches, the alternative name \"tail grind,\" and the related Suski grind. All of these points are directly supported by the retrieved documents (e.g., Docs 1, 2, 5, 6 describe the back\u2011truck grind, weight split, frontside/backside variations, and the tail\u2011grind synonym; Doc 3 mentions the Suski grind as a variation). No irrelevant or incorrect information is present."}
{"query_id": "V_0874", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response directly answers the implied question about how to peel an apple, offering several common methods (vegetable peeler, swivel peeler, potato peeler, Y\u2011shaped peeler, knife, and power\u2011drill technique) and even includes a brief coring note. All of these methods are present in the retrieved documents (e.g., wikiHow for vegetable/swivel peelers, Kitchn and other sources for pulling the peeler toward you, documents 5/6/10 for the drill\u2011peeler hack, and document 11 for the Y\u2011shaped peeler). No unrelated content is introduced. Therefore the answer is fully relevant and fully grounded in the provided sources."}
{"query_id": "V_0005", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 0, "evaluation_notes": "The response addresses the likely question about why some Starship engines are not lit during launch, explaining control authority, redundancy, and test\u2011flight practices. Most of the key points are backed by the retrieved documents (e.g., vacuum engines cannot gimbal, need to fire all engines for control, triple\u2011engine static fire, Super Heavy\u2019s 28 engines). However, a few statements (e.g., that fewer than three sea\u2011level engines risk loss, and that all six engines are required for landing safety) are not directly supported by the provided sources. Therefore the answer is relevant but only partially faithful to the retrieved context."}
{"query_id": "V_0783", "relevance_score": 0, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response does not provide an answer to the user's question about the effects of chewing the pointed or stubby end of an almond; it merely states that the retrieved documents lack this information. Therefore it fails to answer the question (relevance 0). However, the claim that the retrieved documents do not mention almonds is accurate and fully supported by the provided passages, so the response is faithful to the sources (faithfulness 1)."}
{"query_id": "V_0405", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 0, "evaluation_notes": "The response addresses the implied question about dropping a raw egg onto a needle and states that the egg will likely crack, which aligns with the gold answer\u2019s claim that dropping onto a small hard point can cause cracking. The answer is concise and contains no unrelated material, so it is relevant. However, the retrieved documents only discuss the effect of hard surfaces (e.g., concrete, pillow) on eggs and do not mention needles specifically. The general principle that a hard surface causes a high impact force is supported, but the specific claim about a needle is not directly grounded in the provided passages. Therefore the answer is only partially supported by the retrieved context."}
