Because it does not go beyond summarising common knowledge and lacks concrete, innovative insight, it scores low on the insightfulness criterion."]}}

However, it omits other common perspectives such as the Bayesian prior view, the effect on multicollinearity and eigenvalue spectrum, connections to ridge regression theory, and regularization\u2019s role in improving conditioning of the problem.

The language is precise, avoids conversational filler, and each section introduces new information rather than merely rephrasing earlier points.
