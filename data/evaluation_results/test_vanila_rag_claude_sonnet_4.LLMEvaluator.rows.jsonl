{"query_id": "V_0405", "relevance_score": 1, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response addresses the question about dropping a raw egg on a needle, correctly predicting that it would likely crack or break due to the hard, sharp surface creating high impact force. This aligns with the general principle found in the retrieved documents about hard surfaces causing eggs to break. However, the response lacks the nuanced consideration mentioned in the gold reference answer about factors like drop height and needle orientation, which could affect the outcome. The response is well-grounded in the retrieved documents, particularly Document 3 which discusses how hard surfaces like concrete exert large forces on eggs while softer surfaces distribute impact more gradually. The citation [3] correctly references this supporting material."}
{"query_id": "V_0019", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 0, "evaluation_notes": "The response provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of what a 5-0 grind is in skateboarding. It correctly identifies that it's performed using only the back truck with the front truck in the air, explains the naming convention (50% weight distribution), mentions frontside/backside variations, and includes relevant technical details about execution. The response also appropriately distinguishes it from a 50-50 grind and mentions related variations. All information is well-supported by the retrieved documents, with proper citations. The response directly answers the question and contains no irrelevant content. However, there is one minor inaccuracy in the explanation of the '5-0' naming - the response states it refers to weight distribution percentages, but Document 1 indicates the '5' represents the grinding truck and '0' represents the truck in the air, which is about truck usage rather than weight percentages."}
{"query_id": "V_0507", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response directly addresses the question about the difference between The Office and Modern Family regarding actors looking at the camera. It correctly identifies that The Office has an in-universe explanation (documentary crew) while Modern Family uses it as a stylistic choice without clear narrative justification. The response is well-structured and provides accurate information that aligns with the gold reference answer. All key points are supported by the retrieved documents: Document 1 confirms The Office's documentary premise and Modern Family's lack of in-universe explanation, Documents 4-5 detail the removed Dutch filmmaker concept and creators' statements about it being a stylistic choice, and Document 3 discusses the mockumentary similarities. The response stays focused on the specific question without irrelevant content."}
{"query_id": "V_0874", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 0, "evaluation_notes": "The response provides a comprehensive and well-structured answer to the question about how to peel an apple. It covers multiple methods (vegetable peeler, swivel peeler, potato peeler, Y-shaped peeler, and knife method) with clear instructions for each. The response also includes information about coring apples and mentions safety considerations. However, there are some issues with faithfulness: 1) The response mentions references [5][10] for the power drill method, but these specific details about using a spade bit and the exact process are not found in the retrieved documents. 2) Reference [9] is cited for the knife method of 'scraping off the peel,' but Document 9 doesn't describe this specific scraping technique. 3) Reference [11] mentions starting with top and bottom peeling for Y-shaped peelers, which is accurate. Most other information is well-supported by the documents, particularly the vegetable peeler and swivel peeler methods from Documents 1-2. The response is highly relevant as it directly answers the question with practical, actionable advice."}
{"query_id": "V_0478", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response provides a comprehensive and accurate answer to the question about tying shoelaces. It correctly describes the bunny ears method with proper steps (making the X, creating bunny ears, tying the loops) that align well with the gold reference answer. The response also mentions alternative methods like the standard method and one-handed knot, providing users with options. All information is well-grounded in the retrieved documents - the bunny ears method comes from Documents 1, 5, and 8, the standard method from Document 5, and the one-handed knot from Document 2. The response is relevant, helpful, and contains no irrelevant content. The faithfulness is excellent as all claims are directly supported by the source documents with appropriate citations."}
{"query_id": "V_0005", "relevance_score": 0, "faithfulness_score": 0, "evaluation_notes": "The response addresses a question about why not all Starship engines are lit during launch, but there are significant issues with both relevance and faithfulness. For relevance: The response provides detailed technical information about Starship's engine configuration and explains engine roles during different flight phases. However, it doesn't directly address the core question about why some engines might not be operational during launch. The gold reference answer correctly identifies that engines may not be lit due to redundancy design and technical/safety considerations, while the RAG response focuses more on explaining when all engines are needed rather than why some might not be used. For faithfulness: The response makes several claims not supported by the retrieved documents. It states that 'all six engines must fire during ascent to maintain control authority' and 'all engines are required during launch,' but Document 1 only mentions that Starship needs to fire all engines to have control authority without specifying this is mandatory for launch. The response also claims vacuum engines 'cannot gimbal' which is supported, but then makes unsupported leaps about launch requirements. Document 3 shows SN8 using only 3 engines for testing, which contradicts the response's claim that all 6 are always needed. The response appears to conflate different flight phases and makes definitive statements not grounded in the provided context."}
{"query_id": "V_0522", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response provides a comprehensive and accurate answer to the question about removing unwanted people from photos in Photoshop. It correctly identifies Content-Aware Fill as the primary recommended method and provides detailed step-by-step instructions that align with the retrieved documents. The response also mentions alternative tools (Spot Healing Brush, Patch Tool, Clone Stamp Tool) which are all supported by the documents. The workflow described (duplicating layer, using Pen Tool for selection, applying Content-Aware Fill) matches exactly with the procedures outlined in the retrieved documents. The response includes helpful tips about non-destructive editing and references to additional resources. All information provided is grounded in the retrieved documents and directly addresses the user's question with no irrelevant content."}
{"query_id": "V_0406", "relevance_score": 2, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The response provides a comprehensive and accurate overview of DNA extraction procedures that directly answers the implied question about how DNA extraction works. It covers all the essential steps (cell lysis, protein/lipid removal, DNA precipitation, and purification) with appropriate technical detail. The response is well-structured and includes specific examples and methods. All information is well-supported by the retrieved documents - the four-step process matches Document 1's basic procedure, the specific protocols align with Documents 2 and 3, and the mention of commercial kits and various methods corresponds to Document 4. The response is more detailed than the gold reference answer but covers the same core concepts (cell lysis with soap/detergent, alcohol precipitation causing DNA to become visible as white stringy material). No irrelevant content is present, and all claims are grounded in the source documents."}
{"query_id": "V_0783", "relevance_score": 0, "faithfulness_score": 1, "evaluation_notes": "The RAG system's response correctly identifies that the retrieved documents do not contain information about chewing almonds or their effects on gums. The documents focus exclusively on chewing gum, betel nut, and general oral health effects of chewing, with no mention of almonds whatsoever. The response is honest and accurate in stating that it cannot provide details based on the given search results. However, when compared to the gold reference answer which provides specific information about the differential effects of chewing pointed vs. stubby ends of almonds on gums, the RAG response fails to answer the user's question at all. The response is fully grounded in the retrieved documents (which indeed contain no almond information), but provides no useful answer to the question asked."}
