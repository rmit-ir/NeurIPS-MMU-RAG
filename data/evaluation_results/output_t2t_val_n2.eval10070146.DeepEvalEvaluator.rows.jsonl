Additionally, it incorrectly describes the steps for using Content-Aware Fill as being accessed through File > Save As > JPEG, which is inaccurate according to the retrieval context.", "answer_relevancy_reason": "The score is 0.94 because the response is mostly relevant to removing unwanted people from a photo in Photoshop, but it includes a minor irrelevant statement about edge artifacts or blurry edges, which does not directly address the main task.", "contextual_relevancy_reason": "The score is 0.44 because while the retrieval context includes some relevant information about using Photoshop tools like the Lasso Tool, Content-Aware Fill, and Clone Stamp Tool for removing unwanted people from photos, a significant portion of the context is irrelevant, discussing topics like JPEG compression, Edge-Preserving Smoothing, and unrelated promotional or introductory statements. The relevant statements provide useful steps and tools, but they are not consistently present throughout the context."}

However, a few statements directly address the issue of engines not lighting up, citing filter blockage in the liquid oxygen supply as the root cause and describing the landing burn's reduced engine ignition."}
