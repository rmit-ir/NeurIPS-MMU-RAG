I remember the 'heroes' of the day being led by a skilled player from another continent, whose nimble moves and strategic play led to memorable goals. This event also boasted quite the media coverage, shared by a channel that often covers niche sports. The ref, as I recall, was no stranger to the spotlight, having overseen similar thrillers before.
