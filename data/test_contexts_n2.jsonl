{"query":"why there are three engines not light up during starship launch","reference":"During the launch of SpaceX's Starship, some of the engines were not lit up, or in use, because to redundancy and\/or technical or safety considerations. The Starship is equipped with multiple engines, which are designed to to provide the necessary thrust to lift the spacecraft into orbit.
