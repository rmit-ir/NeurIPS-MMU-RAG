{"id": "1", "question": "ChatGPT lunched aupport for MCP, what is a MCP", "answer": "MCP stands for Model Context Protocol, an open standard for connecting AI assistants like ChatGPT to external tools, data sources, and workflows in a consistent, secure way. In plain terms, it’s a unified “adapter” that lets AI read and write to systems such as files, databases, APIs, and apps through a common protocol instead of one-off, vendor-specific plugins.\n\nWhat it is\nMCP is an open, interoperable protocol (inspired by ideas from the Language Server Protocol) that standardizes how AI apps discover capabilities, request operations, and exchange context with external systems via a client–server model using JSON-RPC over transports like stdio or HTTP/SSE.\n\nWhy it matters\nInteroperability: One connector can work across multiple AI ecosystems (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT), reducing the “N×M” integration problem of bespoke adapters for each model and tool.\n\nCapability discovery: AI apps can query MCP servers to learn available tools, resources, and prompts, enabling permissioned, auditable access to actions and data.\n\nRead–write actions: Beyond fetching data, MCP can enable safe write operations (with consent), turning chat assistants into orchestration hubs for real workflows.\n\nHow it works (at a glance)\nHost app (e.g., an AI chat or IDE) includes an MCP client that connects to one or more MCP servers.\n\nOn connect, the client negotiates and lists capabilities (tools/resources/prompts) exposed by each server.\n\nWhen a request needs external context or actions, the app asks for permission, calls the relevant MCP server tool, receives standardized results, and incorporates them into the response.\n\nTypical use cases\nRetrieve or search documents, databases, and cloud files with unified schemas.\n\nOperate developer tools or services (e.g., GitHub, issue trackers, CI/CD) from within the assistant.\n\nPerform business workflows (e.g., CRM updates, payments, ticket lookups) with auditable, permissioned actions.\n\nCurrent ecosystem and adoption\nOriginally introduced by Anthropic and now adopted by other providers and tools, MCP is seeing growing support across assistants and third-party connectors, including recent enablement in developer-focused modes for ChatGPT.\n\nIf helpful, a short mental model: MCP is like a USB-C for AI—standardizing discovery and communication so assistants can safely plug into many systems with fewer custom integrations.", "source": "Perplexity"}
